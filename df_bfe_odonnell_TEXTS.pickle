  SCENE--_A ship at Sea: an island._




[Illustration: ACT I]




SCENE I

_On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard._

_Enter a_ Ship-Master _and a_ Boatswain.

MAST. Boatswain!

BOATS. Here, master: what cheer?

MAST. Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, or we run
ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. [_Exit._

_Enter_ Mariners.

BOATS. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take
in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy
wind, if room enough!

_Enter_ ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, _and others_.

ALON. Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men.

BOATS. I pray now, keep below.

ANT. Where is the master, boatswain?

BOATS. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you
do assist the storm.

GON. Nay, good, be patient.

BOATS. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of
king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

GON. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

BOATS. None that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor; if
you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the
present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in
your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good
hearts! Out of our way, I say.

                                                               [_Exit._

GON. I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath no drowning
mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good
Fate, to his hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our
own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case is
miserable.

                                                             [_Exeunt._

_Re-enter_ Boatswain.

BOATS. Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try with
main-course. [_A cry within._] A plague upon this howling! they are
louder than the weather or our office.

_Re-enter_ SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, _and_ GONZALO.

Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er and drown? Have you a
mind to sink?

SEB. A plague o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, uncharitable
dog!

BOATS. Work you then.

ANT. Hang, cur! hang, you insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be
drowned than thou art.

GON. I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were no stronger
than a nutshell.

BOATS. Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses; off to sea again;
lay her off.

[Illustration: PROSPERO: '_I have done nothing but in care of thee_'
(page 11).]

_Enter_ Mariners _wet_.

MAR. All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

BOATS. What, must our mouths be cold?

    GON. The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
    For our case is as theirs.

    SEB.                   I'm out of patience.

    ANT. We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
    This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
    The washing of ten tides!

    GON.                   He'll be hang'd yet,
    Though every drop of water swear against it
    And gape at widest to glut him.

[_A confused noise within_:--'Mercy on us!'--'We split, we
split!'--'Farewell my wife and children!'--'Farewell, brother!'--'We
split, we split, we split!']

ANT. Let's all sink with the king.

SEB. Let's take leave of him.

                                     [_Exeunt_ ANTONIO _and_ SEBASTIAN.

GON. Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren
ground, ling, heath, broom, furze, any thing. The wills above be done!
but I would fain die a dry death.

                                                             [_Exeunt._


SCENE II

_The island. Before_ PROSPERO'S _cell_.

_Enter_ PROSPERO _and_ MIRANDA.

    MIR. If by your art, my dearest father, you have
    Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
    The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
    But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
    Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
    With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
    Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,
    Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
    Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
    Had I been any god of power, I would
    Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere
    It should the good ship so have swallow'd, and
    The fraughting souls within her.

    PROS.                  Be collected:
    No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
    There's no harm done.

    MIR.                   O, woe the day!

    PROS.                         No harm.
    I have done nothing but in care of thee,
    Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
    Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
    Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
    Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
    And thy no greater father.

    MIR.                   More to know
    Did never meddle with my thoughts.

    PROS.                       'Tis time
    I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
    And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
                                               [_Lays down his mantle._
    Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
    The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
    The very virtue of compassion in thee,
    I have with such provision in mine art
    So safely ordered that there is no soul--
    No, not so much perdition as an hair
    Betid to any creature in the vessel
    Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
    For thou must now know farther.

    MIR.                   You have often
    Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
    And left me to a bootless inquisition,
    Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

    PROS.                  The hour's now come;
    The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
    Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
    A time before we came unto this cell?
    I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
    Out three years old.

    MIR.                   Certainly, sir, I can.

    PROS. By what? by any other house or person?
    Of any thing the image tell me that
    Hath kept with thy remembrance.

    MIR.                   'Tis far off,
    And rather like a dream than an assurance
    That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
    Four or five women once that tended me?

    PROS. Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
    That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
    In the dark backward and abysm of time?
    If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
    How thou camest here thou mayst.

    MIR.                   But that I do not.

    PROS. Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
    Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
    A prince of power.

    MIR.                   Sir, are not you my father?

    PROS. Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
    She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
    Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir
    A princess, no worse issued.

    MIR.                   O the heavens!
    What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
    Or blessed was't we did?

    PROS.                  Both, both, my girl:
    By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
    But blessedly holp hither.

    MIR.                   O, my heart bleeds
    To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
    Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

    PROS. My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
    I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
    Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
    Of all the world I loved and to him put
    The manage of my state; as at that time
    Through all the signories it was the first,
    And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
    In dignity, and for the liberal arts
    Without a parallel; those being all my study,
    The government I cast upon my brother
    And to my state grew stranger, being transported
    And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
    Dost thou attend me?

    MIR.                   Sir, most heedfully.

    PROS. Being once perfected how to grant suits,
    How to deny them, who to advance and who
    To trash for over-topping, new created
    The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed'em,
    Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
    Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
    To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
    The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
    And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

    MIR. O, good sir, I do.

    PROS.                  I pray thee, mark me.
    I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
    To closeness and the bettering of my mind
    With that which, but by being so retired,
    O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
    Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
    Like a good parent, did beget of him
    A falsehood in its contrary as great
    As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
    A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
    Not only with what my revenue yielded,
    But what my power might else exact, like one
    Who having unto truth, by telling of it,
    Made such a sinner of his memory
    To credit his own lie, he did believe
    He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution,
    And executing the outward face of royalty,
    With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
    Dost thou hear?

    MIR.                   Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

    PROS. To have no screen between this part he play'd
    And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
    Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
    Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
    He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
    So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
    To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
    Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
    The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
    To most ignoble stooping.

[Illustration:

    PROSPERO:   '_What seest thou else
      In the dark backward abysm of time?_' (page 13).]

MIR. O the heavens!

    PROS. Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
    If this might be a brother.

    MIR.                   I should sin
    To think but nobly of my grandmother:
    Good wombs have borne bad sons.

    PROS.                  Now the condition.
    This King of Naples, being an enemy
    To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
    Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
    Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
    Should presently extirpate me and mine
    Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan
    With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
    A treacherous army levied, one midnight
    Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
    The gates of Milan; and, i' the dead of darkness,
    The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
    Me and thy crying self.

    MIR.                   Alack, for pity!
    I, not remembering how I cried out then,
    Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
    That wrings mine eyes to't.

    PROS.                  Hear a little further
    And then I'll bring thee to the present business
    Which now's upon's; without the which this story
    Were most impertinent.

    MIR.                   Wherefore did they not
    That hour destroy us?

    PROS.                  Well demanded, wench:
    My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
    So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
    A mark so bloody on the business, but
    With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
    In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
    Bore us some leagues to sea: where they prepared
    A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
    Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
    Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
    To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
    To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
    Did us but loving wrong.

    MIR.                   Alack, what trouble
    Was I then to you!

    PROS.                  O, a cherubin
    Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
    Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
    When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
    Under my burthen groan'd; which rais'd in me
    An undergoing stomach, to bear up
    Against what should ensue.

    MIR.                   How came we ashore?

    PROS. By Providence divine.
    Some food we had and some fresh water that
    A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
    Out of his charity, who being then appointed
    Master of this design, did give us, with
    Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
    Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
    Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
    From mine own library with volumes that
    I prize above my dukedom.

    MIR.                   Would I might
    But ever see that man!

    PROS.                  Now I arise:
                                                 [_Resumes his mantle._

    Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
    Here in this island we arrived; and here
    Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
    Than other princesses can, that have more time
    For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.

    MIR. Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
    For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
    For raising this sea-storm?

    PROS.                  Know thus far forth.
    By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
    Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
    Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
    I find my zenith doth depend upon
    A most auspicious star, whose influence
    If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
    Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
    Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
    And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
                                                     [MIRANDA _sleeps_.
    Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
    Approach, my Ariel, come.

_Enter_ ARIEL.

    ARI. All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
    To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
    To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
    On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
    Ariel and all his quality.

    PROS.                  Hast thou, spirit,
    Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

    ARI. To every article.
    I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
    Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
    I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
    And burn in many places; on the topmast,
    The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
    Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
    O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
    And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
    Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
    Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,
    Yea, his dread trident shake.

    PROS.                  My brave spirit!
    Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
    Would not infect his reason?

    ARI.                   Not a soul
    But felt a fever of the mad, and play'd
    Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
    Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
    Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
    With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
    Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty,
    And all the devils are here.'

    PROS.                  Why, that's my spirit!
    But was not this nigh shore?

    ARI.                   Close by, my master.

    PROS. But are they, Ariel, safe?

    ARI.                   Not a hair perish'd;
    On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
    But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
    In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
    The king's son have I landed by himself;
    Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
    In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,
    His arms in this sad knot.

    PROS.                  Of the king's ship
    The mariners say how thou hast disposed
    And all the rest o' the fleet.

    ARI.                   Safely in harbour
    Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
    Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
    From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
    The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
    Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
    I have left asleep: and for the rest o' the fleet
    Which I dispersed, they all have met again
    And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
    Bound sadly home for Naples,
    Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd,
    And his great person perish.

    PROS.                  Ariel, thy charge
    Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
    What is the time o' the day?

    ARI.                   Past the mid season.

    PROS. At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
    Must by us both be spent most preciously.

    ARI. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
    Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
    Which is not yet perform'd me.

    PROS.                  How now? moody?
    What is't thou canst demand?

    ARI.                   My liberty.

    PROS. Before the time be out? no more!

    ARI.                   I prithee,
    Remember I have done thee worthy service;
    Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
    Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
    To bate me a full year.

    PROS.                  Dost thou forget
    From what a torment I did free thee?

    ARI.                   No.

    PROS. Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
    Of the salt deep,
    To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
    To do me business in the veins o' the earth
    When it is baked with frost.

    ARI.                   I do not, sir.

    PROS. Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
    The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
    Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

    ARI. No, sir.

    PROS. Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.

    ARI. Sir, in Argier.

[Illustration:

    PROSPERO:  '_And by my prescience
      I find my zenith doth depend upon
      A most auspicious star_' (page 21).]

    PROS.                  O, was she so? I must
    Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
    Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
    For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
    To enter human hearing, from Argier,
    Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
    They would not take her life. Is not this true?

    ARI. Ay, sir.

    PROS. This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child
    And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
    As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
    And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
    To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
    Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
    By help of her more potent ministers
    And in her most unmitigable rage,
    Into a cloven pine; within which rift
    Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
    A dozen years; within which space she died
    And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
    As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
    Save for the son that she did litter here,
    A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
    A human shape.

    ARI.                   Yes, Caliban her son.

    PROS. Dull thing, I say so; he that Caliban
    Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
    What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
    Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
    Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
    To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
    Could not again undo: it was mine art,
    When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
    The pine and let thee out.

    ARI.                   I thank thee, master.

    PROS. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
    And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
    Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

    ARI.                   Pardon, master;
    I will be correspondent to command,
    And do my spriting gently.

    PROS.                  Do so, and after two days
    I will discharge thee.

    ARI.                   That's my noble master!
    What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

    PROS. Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
    To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
    To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
    And hither come in 't: go, hence with diligence!
                                                         [_Exit_ ARIEL.
    Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;
    Awake!

    MIR. The strangeness of your story put
    Heaviness in me.

    PROS.                  Shake it off. Come on;
    We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
    Yields us kind answer.

    MIR.                   'Tis a villain, sir,
    I do not love to look on.

    PROS.                  But, as 'tis,
    We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
    Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
    That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban
    Thou earth, thou! speak.

    CAL. [_within._] There's wood enough within.

    PROS. Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
    Come, thou tortoise! when?

    _Re-enter_ ARIEL _like a water-nymph_.

    Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
    Hark in thine ear.

    ARI.                   My lord, it shall be done. [_Exit._

    PROS. Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
    Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

    _Enter_ CALIBAN.

    CAL. As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed
    With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
    Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
    And blister you all o'er!

    PROS. For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
    Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
    Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
    All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
    As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
    Than bees that made 'em.

    CAL.                   I must eat my dinner.
    This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
    Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
    Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
    Water with berries in't, and teach me how
    To name the bigger light, and how the less,
    That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
    And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
    The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
    Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
    Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
    For I am all the subjects that you have,
    Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
    In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
    The rest o' the island.

    PROS.                  Thou most lying slave,
    Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
    Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
    In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
    The honour of my child.

    CAL. O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
    Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
    This isle with Calibans.

    PROS.                  Abhorred slave,
    Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
    Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
    Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
    One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
    Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
    A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
    With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
    Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures
    Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
    Deservedly confined into this rock,
    Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

    CAL.  You taught me language; and my profit on't
    Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
    For learning me your language!

    PROS.                  Hag-seed, hence!
    Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
    To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
    If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
    What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
    Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
    That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

    CAL.                   No, pray thee.
    [_Aside._] I must obey: his art is of such power,
    It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
    And make a vassal of him.

    PROS.                  So, slave; hence! [_Exit_ CALIBAN.

_Re-enter_ ARIEL, _invisible, playing and singing_; FERDINAND
_following_.

    ARIEL'S _song_.

    Come unto these yellow sands,
        And then take hands:
    Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
        The wild waves whist,
    Foot it featly here and there;
    And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
                Hark, hark!
    BURTHEN [_dispersedly_]. Bow-wow.
    ARI. The watch-dogs bark:
    BURTHEN [_dispersedly_]. Bow-wow.
    ARI.  Hark, hark! I hear
    The strain of strutting chanticleer
    Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.

    FER. Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
    It sounds no more: and, sure, it waits upon
    Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
    Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
    This music crept by me upon the waters,
    Allaying both their fury and my passion
    With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
    Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
    No, it begins again.

    ARIEL _sings_.

    Full fathom five thy father lies;
        Of his bones are coral made;
    Those are pearls that were his eyes:
        Nothing of him that doth fade
    But doth suffer a sea-change
    Into something rich and strange.
    Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:

    BURTHEN.               Ding-dong.

    ARI. Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

    FER. The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
    This is no mortal business, nor no sound
    That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

    PROS. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
    And say what thou seest yond.

    MIR.                   What is't? a spirit?
    Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
    It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

    PROS. No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
    As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
    Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
    With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
    A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
    And strays about to find 'em.

    MIR.                   I might call him
    A thing divine, for nothing natural
    I ever saw so noble.

[Illustration:

    CALIBAN: '_Wouldst give me
      Water with berries in't_' (page 31).]


    PROS. [_aside._]  It goes on, I see,
    As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
    Within two days for this.

    FER.                   Most sure, the goddess
    On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
    May know if you remain upon this island;
    And that you will some good instruction give
    How I may bear me here: my prime request,
    Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
    If you be maid or no?

    MIR.                   No wonder, sir;
    But certainly a maid.

    FER.                   My language! heavens!
    I am the best of them that speak this speech,
    Were I but where 'tis spoken.

    PROS.                  How? the best?
    What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

    FER. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
    To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
    And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
    Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
    The king my father wreck'd.

    MIR.                   Alack, for mercy!

    FER. Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
    And his brave son being twain.

    PROS. [_aside._]  The Duke of Milan
    And his more braver daughter could control thee,
    If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
    They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
    I'll set thee free for this. [_To_ FER.] A word, good sir;
    I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

    MIR. Why speaks my father so ungently? This
    Is the third man that e'er I saw; the first
    That e'er I sighed for: pity move my father
    To be inclined my way!

    FER.                   O, if a virgin,
    And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
    The queen of Naples.

    PROS.                  Soft, sir! one word more.
    [_Aside._] They are both in either's powers; but
      this swift business
    I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
    Make the prize light. [_To_ FER.] One word more;
      I charge thee
    That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
    The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
    Upon this island as a spy, to win it
    From me, the lord on't.

    FER.                   No, as I am a man.

    MIR. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
    If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
    Good things will strive to dwell with't.

    PROS.                  Follow me.
    Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
    I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
    Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
    The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
    Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

    FER.                   No;
    I will resist such entertainment till
    Mine enemy has more power.

                                  [_Draws, and is charmed from moving._

    MIR.                   O dear father,
    Make not too rash a trial of him, for
    He's gentle and not fearful.

    PROS. What? I say,
    My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
    Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
    Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
    For I can here disarm thee with this stick
    And make thy weapon drop.

    MIR. Beseech you, father.

    PROS. Hence! hang not on my garments.

    MIR. Sir, have pity;
    I'll be his surety.

    PROS.                  Silence! one word more
    Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
    An advocate for an impostor! hush!
    Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
    Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
    To the most of men this is a Caliban,
    And they to him are angels.

    MIR.                   My affections
    Are then most humble; I have no ambition
    To see a goodlier man.

    PROS.                  Come on; obey:
    Thy nerves are in their infancy again
    And have no vigour in them.

    FER.                   So they are;
    My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
    My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
    The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
    To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
    Might I but through my prison once a day
    Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
    Let liberty make use of; space enough
    Have I in such a prison.

    PROS. [_aside._] It works. [_To_ FER.]
      Come on.
    Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! [_To_ FER.] Follow me.
    [_To_ ARIEL.] Hark what thou else shalt do me.

    MIR.                   Be of comfort;
    My father's of a better nature, sir,
    Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
    Which now came from him.

    PROS.                  Thou shalt be as free
    As mountain winds: but then exactly do
    All points of my command.

    ARI.                   To the syllable.

    PROS. Come, follow. Speak not for him.  [_Exeunt._




[Illustration: ACT II]




SCENE I

_Another part of the island._

_Enter_ ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, _and
others_.

    GON. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
    So have we all, of joy; for our escape
    Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
    Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
    The masters of some merchant, and the merchant,
    Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
    I mean our preservation, few in millions
    Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
    Our sorrow with our comfort.

ALON. Prithee, peace.

SEB. He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANT. The visitor will not give him o'er so.

SEB. Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit: by and by it will
strike.

GON. Sir,--

SEB. One: tell.

    GON. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
    Comes to the entertainer--

SEB. A dollar.

GON. Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than you
purposed.

SEB. You have taken it wiselier that I meant you should.

GON. Therefore, my lord,--

ANT. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALON. I prithee, spare.

GON. Well, I have done: but yet,--

SEB. He will be talking.

ANT. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?

SEB. The old cock.

ANT. The cockerel.

SEB. Done. The wager?

ANT. A laughter.

SEB. A match!

ADR. Though this island seem to be desert,--

SEB. Ha, ha, ha!

ANT. So, you're paid.

ADR. Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--

SEB. Yet,--

ADR. Yet,--

ANT. He could not miss't.

ADR. It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate temperance.

ANT. Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEB. Ay, and a subtle: as he most learnedly delivered.

ADR. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

SEB. As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANT. Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GON. Here is every thing advantageous to life.

ANT. True: save means to live.

SEB. Of that there's none, or little.

GON. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANT. The ground indeed is tawny.

SEB. With an eye of green in't.

ANT. He misses not much.

SEB. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

GON. But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost beyond credit,--

SEB. As many vouched rarities are.

GON. That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold
notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than
stained with salt water.

ANT. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?

SEB. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.

GON. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on
first in Afric, at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to
the King of Tunis.

SEB. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.

ADR. Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.

GON. Not since widow Dido's time.

ANT. Widow! a plague o' that! How came that widow in? widow Dido!

SEB. What if he had said 'widower Ã†neas' too? Good Lord, how you take
it!

ADR. 'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that: she was of
Carthage, not of Tunis.

GON. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADR. Carthage?

GON. I assure you, Carthage.

ANT. His word is more than the miraculous harp.

SEB. He hath raised the wall and houses too.

ANT. What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEB. I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it
his son for an apple.

ANT. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.

GON. Ay.

ANT. Why, in good time.

GON. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when
we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.

ANT. And the rarest that e'er came there.

SEB. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

ANT. O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GON. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I
mean, in a sort.

ANT. That sort was well fished for.

GON. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?

    ALON. You cram these words into mine ears against
    The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
    Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
    My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
    Who is so far from Italy removed
    I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
    Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
    Hath made his meal on thee?

    FRAN.                  Sir, he may live:
    I saw him beat the surges under him,
    And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
    Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
    The surge most swoln that met him: his bold head
    'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
    Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
    To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
    As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
    He came alive to land.

    ALON.                  No, no, he's gone.

    SEB. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
    That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
    But rather lose her to an African;
    Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
    Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

    ALON.                  Prithee, peace.

    SEB. You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
    By all of us, and the fair soul herself
    Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
    Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your son,
    I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
    Mo widows in them of this business' making
    Than we bring men to comfort them:
    The fault's your own.

    ALON.                  So is the dear'st o' the loss.

    GON. My lord Sebastian,
    The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
    And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
    When you should bring the plaster.

    SEB.                   Very well.

ANT. And most chirurgeonly.

    GON. It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
    When you are cloudy.

SEB. Foul weather?

ANT. Very foul.

GON. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

ANT. He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

[Illustration:

    ANTONIO:  '_Here lies your brother,
      No better than the earth he lies upon_' (page 61).]

SEB. Or docks, or mallows

GON. And were the king on't, what would I do?

SEB. 'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

    GON. I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
    Execute all things: for no kind of traffic
    Would I admit; no name of magistrate:
    Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
    And use of service, none; contract, succession,
    Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
    No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
    No occupation: all men idle, all;
    And women too, but innocent and pure;
    No sovereignty;--

SEB. Yet he would be king on't.

ANT. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.

    GON. All things in common nature should produce
    Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
    Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
    Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
    Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
    To feed my innocent people.

SEB. No marrying 'mong his subjects?

ANT. None, man; all idle.

    GON. I would with such perfection govern, sir,
    To excel the golden age.

SEB. Save his majesty!

ANT. Long live Gonzalo!

GON. And,--do you mark me, sir?

ALON. Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

GON. I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion
to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they
always use to laugh at nothing.

ANT. 'Twas you we laughed at.

GON. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you: so you may
continue and laugh at nothing still.

ANT. What a blow was there given!

SEB. An it had not fallen flat-long.

GON. You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would lift the moon out of
her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.

    _Enter_ ARIEL, _invisible, playing solemn music_.

SEB. We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

ANT. Nay, good my lord, be not angry. GON. No, I warrant you; I will
not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I
am very heavy?

ANT. Go sleep, and hear us.

                  [_All sleep except_ ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, _and_ ANTONIO.

    ALON. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
    Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
    They are inclined to do so.

    SEB.                   Please you, sir,
    Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
    It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
    It is a comforter.

    ANT.                   We too, my lord,
    Will guard your person while you take your rest,
    And watch your safety.

    ALON.                  Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

                                          [ALONSO _sleeps. Exit_ ARIEL.

SEB. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANT. It is the quality o' the climate.

    SEB.                   Why
    Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
    Myself disposed to sleep.

    ANT.                   Nor I; my spirits are nimble,
    They fell together all, as by consent;
    They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
    Worthy Sebastian?--O, what might?--No more:--
    And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
    What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
    My strong imagination sees a crown
    Dropping upon thy head.

SEB. What, art thou waking?

ANT. Do you not hear me speak?

    SEB.                   I do; and surely
    It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
    Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
    This is a strange repose, to be asleep
    With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
    And yet so fast asleep.

    ANT.                   Noble Sebastian,
    Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
    Whiles thou art waking.

    SEB.                   Thou dost snore distinctly;
    There's meaning in thy snores.

    ANT. I am more serious than my custom: you
    Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
    Trebles thee o'er.

    SEB.                   Well, I am standing water.

ANT. I'll teach you how to flow.

    SEB.                   Do so: to ebb
    Hereditary sloth instructs me.

    ANT.                   O,
    If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
    Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
    You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
    Most often do so near the bottom run
    By their own fear or sloth.

    SEB.                   Prithee, say on:
    The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
    A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
    Which throes thee much to yield.

    ANT.                   Thus, sir:
    Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
    Who shall be of as little memory
    When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded--
    For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
    Professes to persuade--the king his son's alive,
    'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
    As he that sleeps here swims.

    SEB.                   I have no hope
    That he's undrown'd.

    ANT.                   O, out of that 'no hope'
    What great hope have you! no hope that way is
    Another way so high a hope that even
    Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
    But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
    That Ferdinand is drown'd?

    SEB.                   He's gone.

    ANT.                   Then, tell me,
    Who's the next heir of Naples?

    SEB.                   Claribel.

    ANT. She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
    Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
    Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
    The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
    Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
    We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
    And by that destiny to perform an act
    Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
    In yours and my discharge.

    SEB.                   What stuff is this! how say you?
    'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
    So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
    There is some space.

    ANT.                   A space whose every cubit
    Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
    Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
    And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
    That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
    Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
    As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
    As amply and unnecessarily
    As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
    A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
    The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
    For your advancement! Do you understand me?

SEB. Methinks I do.

    ANT.                   And how does your content
    Tender your own good fortune?

    SEB.                   I remember
    You did supplant your brother Prospero.

    ANT.                   True:
    And look how well my garments sit upon me;
    Much feater than before: my brother's servants
    Were then my fellows: now they are my men.

    SEB. But, for your conscience?

    ANT. Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
    'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
    This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
    That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
    And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
    No better than the earth he lies upon,
    If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
    Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
    Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
    To the perpetual wink for aye might put
    This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
    Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
    They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
    They'll tell the clock to any business that
    We say befits the hour.

    SEB.                   Thy case, dear friend,
    Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
    I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
    Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
    And I the king shall love thee.

    ANT.                   Draw together;
    And when I rear my hand do you the like,
    To fall it on Gonzalo.

    SEB.                   O, but one word.  [_They talk apart._

    _Re-enter_ ARIEL, _invisible_.

    ARI. My master through his art foresees the danger
    That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
    For else his project dies--to keep them living.

                                           [_Sings in_ GONZALO's _ear_.

    While you here do snoring lie,
    Open-eyed conspiracy
        His time doth take.
    If of life you keep a care,
    Shake off slumber, and beware:
        Awake, awake!

ANT. Then let us both be sudden.

    GON.                   Now, good angels
    Preserve the king! [_They wake._

    ALON. Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
    Wherefore this ghastly looking?

    GON.                   What's the matter?

    SEB. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
    Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
    Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
    It struck mine ear most terribly.

    ALON.                  I heard nothing.

    ANT. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
    To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
    Of a whole herd of lions.

    ALON.                  Heard you this, Gonzalo?

    GON. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
    And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
    I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
    I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
    That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
    Or that we quit this place: let's draw our weapons.

    ALON. Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
    For my poor son.

    GON.                   Heavens keep him from these beasts!
    For he is, sure, i' the island.

    ALON.                  Lead away.

    ARI. Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
    So, king, go safely on to seek thy son. [_Exeunt._

[Illustration: STEPHANO: '_Come, swear to that: kiss the book_' (page
72).]


SCENE II

_Another part of the island._

_Enter_ CALIBAN _with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard_.

    CAL. All the infections that the sun sucks up
    From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him
    By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,
    And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
    Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' the mire,
    Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
    Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
    For every trifle are they set upon me;
    Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
    And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which
    Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
    Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
    All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
    Do hiss me into madness.

_Enter_ TRINCULO.

                                    Lo, now, lo!
    Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
    For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
    Perchance he will not mind me.

TRIN. Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all,
and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i' the wind; yond same black
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his
liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to
hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What
have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a
fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of, not of the newest,
poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a
piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast
there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legged like a man!
and his fins like arms! Warm o' my trot! I do now let loose my opinion;
hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately
suffered by a thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come again!
my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter
hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I will here
shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.

_Enter_ STEPHANO, _singing: a bottle in his hand_.

    STEPH. I shall no more to sea, to sea,
             Here shall I die ashore--

    This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
    funeral: well, here's my comfort. [_Drinks._

[_Sings._]

    The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
          The gunner and his mate
    Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
        But none of us cared for Kate;
        For she had a tongue with a tang,
        Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
    She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch:
        Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!

This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort. [_Drinks._

CAL. Do not torment me: Oh!

STEPH. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon's
with savages and men of Ind, ha? I have not 'scaped drowning to be
afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man
as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be
said so again while Stephano breathes at nostrils.

CAL. The spirit torments me: Oh!

STEPH. This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got,
as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I
will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a present for any
emperor that ever trod on neat's-leather.

CAL. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.

STEPH. He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest. He shall
taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near
to remove his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will not
take too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that
soundly.

CAL. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I know it by thy
trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.

STEPH. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that which will give
language to you, cat: open your mouth; this will shake your shaking,
I can tell you, and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
open your chaps again.

TRIN. I should know that voice: it should be--but he is drowned; and
these are devils: O defend me!

STEPH. Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster! His forward
voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to
utter foul speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in thy
other mouth.

TRIN. Stephano!

STEPH. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is a devil, and
no monster; I will leave him; I have no long spoon.

TRIN. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and speak to me; for I
am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy good friend Trinculo.

STEPH. If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee by the
lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs, these are they. Thou art very
Trinculo indeed! How camest thou here?

TRIN. I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But art thou
not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm
overblown? I hid me under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans
'scaped.

STEPH. Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.

    CAL. [_aside._] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.
    That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
    I will kneel to him.

STEPH. How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither? swear by this
bottle how thou camest hither. I escaped upon a butt of sack which the
sailors heaved o'erboard, by this bottle which I made of the bark of a
tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore.

CAL. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject; for the liquor
is not earthly.

STEPH. Here; swear then how thou escapedst.

TRIN. Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I'll be
sworn.

STEPH. Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou
art made like a goose.

TRIN. O Stephano, hast any more of this?

STEPH. The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the sea-side
where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf! how does thine ague?

CAL. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

STEPH. Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i' the moon
when time was.

    CAL. I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee: My mistress
    show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

STEPH. Come, swear to that: kiss the book: I will furnish it anon with
new contents: swear.

TRIN. By this good light, this is a very shallow monster! I afeard of
him! A very weak monster! The man i' the moon! A most poor credulous
monster! Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!

    CAL. I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
    And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

TRIN. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster! when's
god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.

CAL. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

STEPH. Come on then; down, and swear.

TRIN. I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A
most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,--

STEPH. Come, kiss.

TRIN. But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!

    CAL. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
    I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
    A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
    I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
    Thou wondrous man.

TRIN. A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!

    CAL. I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
    And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
    Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
    To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
    To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
    Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

STEPH. I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking. Trinculo,
the king and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here:
here; bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by and by again.

    CAL. [_sings drunkenly_]
    Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!

TRIN. A howling monster; a drunken monster!

    CAL. No more dams I'll  make for fish;
             Nor fetch in firing
             At requiring;
         Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish:
             'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
             Has a new master: get a new man.

    Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
    hey-day, freedom!

STEPH. O brave monster! Lead the way. [_Exeunt._

SCENE I

_Before_ PROSPERO'S _cell_.

_Enter_ FERDINAND, _bearing a log_.

    FER. There be some sports are painful, and their labour
    Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
    Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
    Point to rich ends. This my mean task
    Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
    The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
    And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
    Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
    And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
    Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
    Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
    Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
    Had never like executor. I forget:
    But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
    Most busy lest, when I do it.

_Enter_ MIRANDA; _and_ PROSPERO _at a distance unseen_.

    MIR.                   Alas, now, pray you,
    Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
    Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
    Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
    'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
    Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
    He's safe for these three hours.

    FER.                   O most dear mistress,
    The sun will set before I shall discharge
    What I must strive to do.

    MIR.                   If you'll sit down,
    I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
    I'll carry it to the pile.

[Illustration: ARIEL: '_You are three men of sin_' (page 99).]

    FER.                   No, precious creature;
    I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
    Than you should such dishonour undergo,
    While I sit lazy by.

    MIR.                   It would become me
    As well as it does you: and I should do it
    With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
    And yours it is against.

    PROS.                  Poor worm, thou art infected!
    This visitation shows it.

    MIR.                   You look wearily.

    FER. No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me
    When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
    Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
    What is your name?

    MIR.                   Miranda.--O my father,
    I have broke your hest to say so!

    FER.                   Admired Miranda!
    Indeed the top of admiration! worth
    What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
    I have eyed with best regard, and many a time
    The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
    Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
    Have I liked several women; never any
    With so full soul, but some defect in her
    Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
    And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
    So perfect and so peerless, are created
    Of every creature's best!

    MIR.                   I do not know
    One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
    Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
    More that I may call men than you, good friend,
    And my dear father: how features are abroad,
    I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
    The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
    Any companion in the world but you,
    Nor can imagination form a shape,
    Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
    Something too wildly and my father's precepts
    I therein do forget.

    FER.                   I am in my condition
    A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
    I would, not so!--and would no more endure
    This wooden slavery than to suffer
    The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
    The very instant that I saw you, did
    My heart fly to your service; there resides,
    To make me slave to it; and for your sake
    Am I this patient log-man.

    MIR.                   Do you love me?

    FER. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
    And crown what I profess with kind event
    If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
    What best is boded me to mischief! I
    Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
    Do love, prize, honour you.

    MIR.                   I am a fool
    To weep at what I am glad of.

    PROS.                  Fair encounter
    Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
    On that which breeds between 'em!

    FER.                   Wherefore weep you?

    MIR. At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
    What I desire to give, and much less take
    What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
    And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
    The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
    And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
    I am your wife, if you will marry me;
    If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
    You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
    Whether you will or no.

    FER.                   My mistress, dearest;
    And I thus humble ever.

    MIR.                   My husband, then?

    FER. Ay, with a heart as willing
    As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

    MIR. And mine, with my heart in't: and now farewell
    Till half an hour hence.

    FER.                   A thousand thousand!

                         [_Exeunt_ FERDINAND _and_ MIRANDA _severally_.

    PROS. So glad of this as they I cannot be,
    Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
    At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
    For yet ere supper-time must I perform
    Much business appertaining. [_Exit._


SCENE II

_Another part of the island._

_Enter_ CALIBAN, STEPHANO, _and_ TRINCULO.

STEPH. Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink water; not a
drop before: therefore bear up, and board 'em. Servant-monster, drink
to me.

TRIN. Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They say there's but
five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th' other two be brained
like us, the state totters.

STEPH. Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set
in thy head.

TRIN. Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if
they were set in his tail.

STEPH. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack: for my part, the
sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five and
thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
monster, or my standard.

TRIN. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.

STEPH. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.

TRIN. Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing
neither.

STEPH. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good
moon-calf.

    CAL. How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
    I'll not serve him; he is not valiant.

TRIN. Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a
constable. Why, thou deboshed fish, thou, was there ever man a coward
that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous
lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?

CAL. Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?

TRIN. 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!

CAL. Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.

STEPH. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a
mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's my subject and he shall
not suffer indignity.

CAL. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again
to the suit I made to thee?

STEPH. Marry, will I: kneel and repeat it; I will stand, and so shall
Trinculo.

_Enter_ ARIEL, _invisible_.

CAL. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that
by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

ARI. Thou liest.

    CAL. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou:
    I would my valiant master would destroy thee!
    I do not lie.

STEPH. Trinculo, if you trouble him anymore in's tale, by this hand, I
will supplant some of your teeth.

TRIN. Why, I said nothing.

STEPH. Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.

    CAL. I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
    From me he got it. If thy greatness will
    Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
    But this thing dare not,--

    STEPH. That's most certain.

CAL. Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.

STEPH. How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the
party?

    CAL. Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
    Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.

ARI. Thou liest; thou canst not.

    CAL. What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
    I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
    And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
    He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
    Where the quick freshes are.

STEPH. Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one
word further, and, by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors, and
make a stock-fish of thee.

TRIN. Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther off.

STEPH. Didst thou not say he lied?

ARI. Thou liest.

STEPH. Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats_ TRINCULO.] As you like this,
give me the lie another time.

TRIN. I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and hearing too? A
plague o' your bottle! this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your
monster, and the devil take your fingers.

CAL. Ha, ha, ha!

STEPH. Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther off.

    CAL. Beat him enough: after a little time
    I'll beat him too.

    STEPH.                 Stand farther. Come, proceed.

    CAL. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
    I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
    Having first seized his books, or with a log
    Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
    Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
    First to possess his books; for without them
    He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
    One spirit to command: they all do hate him
    As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
    He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--
    Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal.
    And that most deeply to consider is
    The beauty of his daughter; he himself
    Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
    But only Sycorax my dam and she;
    But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
    As great'st does least.

    STEPH.                 Is it so brave a lass?

    CAL. Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,
    And bring thee forth brave brood.

STEPH. Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I will be
king and queen,--save our graces!--and Trinculo and thyself shall be
viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?

TRIN. Excellent.

STEPH. Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but, while thou
livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.

    CAL. Within this half hour will he be asleep:
    Wilt thou destroy him then?

    STEPH.                 Ay, on mine honour.

ARI. This will I tell my master.

    CAL. Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
    Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
    You taught me but while-ere?

STEPH. At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason. Come on,
Trinculo, let us sing.

    [_Sings_] Flout 'em and scout 'em
              And scout 'em and flout 'em;
                  Thought is free.

CAL. That's not the tune.

                           [ARIEL _plays the tune on a tabor and pipe_.

STEPH. What is this same?

TRIN. This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.

STEPH. If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou beest
a devil, take't as thou list.

TRIN. O, forgive me my sins!

STEPH. He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!

CAL. Art thou afeard?

STEPH. No, monster, not I.

    CAL. Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
    Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
    Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
    Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
    That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
    Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
    The clouds methought would open and show riches
    Ready to drop upon me, that, when I waked,
    I cried to dream again.

STEPH. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my
music for nothing.

CAL. When Prospero is destroyed.

STEPH. That shall be by and by: I remember the story.

TRIN. The sound is going away; let's follow it, and after do our work.

STEPH. Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see this taborer;
he lays it on.

TRIN. Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.

                                                             [_Exeunt._

[Illustration:

    IRIS:      '_I met her deity
      Cutting the clouds towards Paphos_' (page 110).]


SCENE III

_Another part of the island._

_Enter_ ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, _and
others_.

    GON. By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
    My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
    Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
    I needs must rest me.

    _Alon._                    Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
    Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
    To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
    Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
    No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
    Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
    Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

    ANT. [_aside to_ SEB.]
    I am right glad that he's so out of hope.
    Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
    That you resolved to effect.

    SEB. [_aside to_ ANT.]      The next advantage
    Will we take throughly.

    ANT. [_aside to_ SEB.]
                                    Let it be to-night:
    For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
    Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
    As when they are fresh.

    SEB. [_aside to_ ANT.]      I say, to-night: no more.

                                           [_Solemn and strange music._

ALON. What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

GON. Marvellous sweet music!

    _Enter_ PROSPERO _above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes,
      bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of
      salutation; and, inviting the King, etc. to eat, they depart._

ALON. Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these!

    SEB. A living drollery. Now I will believe
    That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
    There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
    At this hour reigning there.

    ANT.                   I'll believe both;
    And what does else want credit, come to me,
    And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did lie,
    Though fools at home condemn 'em.

    GON.                   If in Naples
    I should report this now, would they believe me?
    If I should say, I saw such islanders--
    For, certes, these are people of the island--
    Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
    Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
    Our human generation you shall find
    Many, nay, almost any.

    PROS. [_aside._]            Honest lord,
    Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
    Are worse than devils.

    ALON.                       I cannot too much muse
    Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
    Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
    Of excellent dumb discourse.

    PROS. [_aside._]            Praise in departing.

FRAN. They vanish'd strangely.

    SEB.                   No matter, since
    They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
    Will't please you taste of what is here?

    ALON.                  Not I.

    GON. Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
    Who would believe that there were mountaineers
    Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
    Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
    Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
    Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
    Good warrant of.

    ALON.                  I will stand to and feed,
    Although my last: no matter, since I feel
    The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
    Stand to and do as we.

_Thunder and lightning._ _Enter_ ARIEL, _like a harpy; claps his wings
upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes_.

    ARI. You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
    That hath to instrument this lower world
    And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
    Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
    Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
    Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
    And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
    Their proper selves.
                          [ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, _etc. draw their swords_.
                           You fools! I and my fellows
    Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
    Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
    Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
    Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
    One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
    Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
    Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
    And will not be uplifted. But remember--
    For that's my business to you--that you three
    From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
    Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
    Him and his innocent child; for which foul deed
    The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
    Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
    Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
    They have bereft; and do pronounce by me
    Lingering perdition, worse than any death
    Can be at once, shall step by step attend
    You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
    Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
    Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
    And a clear life ensuing.

_He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes again,
and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table._

    PROS. Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
    Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
    Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
    In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
    And observation strange, my meaner ministers
    Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
    And these mine enemies are all knit up
    In their distractions; they now are in my power;
    And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
    Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
    And his and mine loved darling. [_Exit above._

    GON. I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
    In this strange stare?

    ALON.                  O, it is monstrous, monstrous!
    Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
    The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
    That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
    The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
    Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
    I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
    And with him there lie mudded. [_Exit._

    SEB.                   But one fiend at a time,
    I'll fight their legions o'er.

    ANT.                   I'll be thy second.

                                     [_Exeunt_ SEBASTIAN _and_ ANTONIO.

    GON. All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
    Like poison given to work a great time after,
    Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
    That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
    And hinder them from what this ecstasy
    May now provoke them to.

    ADR.                   Follow, I pray you. [_Exeunt._




[Illustration: ACT IV]




SCENE I

_Before_ PROSPERO'S _cell_.

_Enter_ PROSPERO, FERDINAND, _and_ MIRANDA.

    PROS. If I have too austerely punish'd you,
    Your compensation makes amends, for I
    Have given you here a third of mine own life,
    Or that for which I live; who once again
    I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
    Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
    Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,
    I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
    Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
    For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
    And make it halt behind her.

    FER.                   I do believe it
    Against an oracle.

    PROS. Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
    Worthily purchased, take my daughter: but
    If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
    All sanctimonious ceremonies may
    With full and holy rite be minister'd,
    No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
    To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
    Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
    The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
    That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
    As Hymen's lamps shall light you.

    FER.                   As I hope
    For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
    With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
    The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion
    Our worser genius can, shall never melt
    Mine honour into lust, to take away
    The edge of that day's celebration,
    When I shall think, or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
    Or Night kept chain'd below.

    PROS.                  Fairly spoke.
    Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
    What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!

_Enter_ ARIEL.

ARI. What would my potent master? here I am.

    PROS. Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
    Did worthily perform; and I must use you
    In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
    O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
    Incite them to quick motion; for I must
    Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
    Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
    And they expect it from me.

    ARI.                   Presently?

PROS. Ay, with a twink.

    Ari. Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
    And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
    Each one, tripping on his toe,
    Will be here with mop and mow.
    Do you love me, master? no?

    PROS. Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
    Till thou dost hear me call.

    ARI.                   Well, I conceive. [_Exit._

    PROS. Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
    Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
    To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
    Or else, good night your vow!

    FER.                   I warrant you, sir;
    The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
    Abates the ardour of my liver.

    PROS.                  Well.
    Now come, my Ariel! I bring a corollary,
    Rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly!
    No tongue! all eyes! be silent. [_Soft music._

    _Enter_ IRIS.

    IRIS. Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
    Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
    Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
    And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
    Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
    To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
    Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
    Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;
    And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
    Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
    Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
    Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
    To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
    Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

[Illustration:

    IRIS: '_You Nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
      Leave your crisp channels_' (page 112).]

_Enter_ CERES.

    CER. Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
    Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
    Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
    Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
    And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
    My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
    Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
    Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?

    IRIS. A contract of true love to celebrate;
    And some donation freely to estate
    On the blest lovers.

    CER.                   Tell me, heavenly bow,
    If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
    Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
    The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
    Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
    I have forsworn.

    IRIS.                  Of her society
    Be not afraid: I met her deity
    Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son
    Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
    Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
    Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
    Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but in vain;
    Mars's hot minion is return'd again;
    Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
    Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows
    And be a boy right out.

    CER.                   High'st queen of state,
    Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.

_Enter_ JUNO.

    JUNO. How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
    To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
    And honour'd in their issue.      [_They sing._

    JUNO. Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
          Long continuance, and increasing,
          Hourly joys be still upon you!
          Juno sings her blessings on you.
    CER.  Earth's increase, foison plenty,
          Barns and garners never empty,
          Vines with clustering bunches growing,
          Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
          Spring come to you at the farthest
          In the very end of harvest!
          Scarcity and want shall shun you;
          Ceres' blessing so is on you.

    FER. This is a most majestic vision, and
    Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold
    To think these spirits?

    PROS.                  Spirits, which by mine art
    I have from their confines call'd to enact
    My present fancies.

    FER.                   Let me live here ever;
    So rare a wonder'd father and a wise
    Makes this place Paradise.

            [JUNO _and_ CERES _whisper, and send_ IRIS _on employment_.

    PROS.                  Sweet, now, silence!
    Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
    There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
    Or else our spell is marr'd.

    IRIS. You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
    With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
    Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
    Answer your summons; Juno does command:
    Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
    A contract of true love; be not too late.

[Illustration: PROSPERO:

        '_We are such stuff
    As dreams are made on_' (page 114).]

_Enter certain Nymphs._

    You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
    Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
    Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on
    And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
    In country footing.

_Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in
a graceful dance; towards the end whereof_ PROSPERO _starts suddenly,
and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they
heavily vanish_.

    PROS. [_aside._] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
    Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
    Against my life: the minute of their plot
    Is almost come. [_To the Spirits._] Well done! avoid; no more!

    FER. This is strange: your father's in some passion
    That works him strongly.

    MIR.                   Never till this day
    Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.

    PROS. You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
    As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
    Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
    As I foretold you, were all spirits and
    Are melted into air, into thin air:
    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
    The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
    As dreams are made on, and our little life
    Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
    Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:
    Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
    If you be pleased, retire into my cell
    And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
    To still my beating mind.

    FER. MIR.              We wish your peace. [_Exeunt._

PROS. Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel: come.

    _Enter_ ARIEL.

ARI. Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?

    PROS.                  Spirit,
    We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

    ARI. Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
    I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
    Lest I might anger thee.

PROS. Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?

    ARI. I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
    So full of valour that they smote the air
    For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
    For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
    Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor;
    At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,
    Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
    As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
    That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
    Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
    Which enter'd their frail shins: at last I left them
    I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
    There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
    O'erstunk their feet.

    PROS.                  This was well done, my bird.
    Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
    The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
    For stale to catch these thieves.

    ARI.                   I go, I go. [_Exit._

    PROS. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
    Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
    Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
    And as with age his body uglier grows,
    So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
    Even to roaring.

_Re-enter_ ARIEL, _loaden with glistering apparel, etc._

    Come, hang them on this line.

PROSPERO _and_ ARIEL _remain, invisible. Enter_ CALIBAN, STEPHANO,
_and_ TRINCULO, _all wet_.

    CAL. Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
    Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

STEPH. Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done
little better than played the Jack with us. Do you hear, monster? If I
should take a displeasure against you, look you,--

TRIN. Thou wert but a lost monster.

    CAL. Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
    Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
    Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly,
    All's hush'd as midnight yet.

TRIN. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--

STEPH. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but
an infinite loss.

TRIN. That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless
fairy, monster.

STEPH. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears for my labour.

    CAL. Prithee, my king, be quiet. See'st thou here,
    This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
    Do that good mischief which may make this island
    Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
    For aye thy foot-licker.

STEPH. Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

TRIN. O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look what a wardrobe
here is for thee!

CAL. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

TRIN. O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery! O king
Stephano!

STEPH. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand I'll have that gown.

TRIN. Thy grace shall have it.

    CAL. The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean
    To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
    And do the murder first: if he awake,
    From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
    Make us strange stuff.

STEPH. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now
is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
hair and prove a bald jerkin.

TRIN. Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.

STEPH. I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't: wit shall
not go unrewarded while I am king of this country. 'Steal by line and
level' is an excellent pass of pate; there's another garment for't.

TRIN. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the
rest.

    CAL. I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
    And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
    With foreheads villanous low.

STEPH. Monster, lay to your fingers: help to bear this away where my
hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you out of my kingdom: go to, carry
this.

TRIN. And this.

STEPH. Ay, and this.

_A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and
hounds, hunting them about;_ PROSPERO _and_ ARIEL _setting them on_.

PROS. Hey, Mountain, hey!

ARI. Silver! there it goes, Silver!

PROS. Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!

                   [CALIBAN, STEPHANO, _and_ TRINCULO _are driven out_.

    Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
    With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
    With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
    Than pard or cat o' mountain.

    ARI.                   Hark, they roar!

    PROS.  Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
    Lies at my mercy all mine enemies:
    Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
    Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
    Follow, and do me service.      [_Exeunt._

    In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell_' (page 123).]




[Illustration: ACT V]




SCENE I

_Before_ PROSPERO'S _cell_.

_Enter_ PROSPERO _in his magic robes, and_ ARIEL.

    PROS. Now does my project gather to a head:
    My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
    Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?

    ARI. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
    You said our work should cease.

    PROS.                  I did say so,
    When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
    How fares the king and 's followers?

    ARI.                   Confined together
    In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
    Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
    In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
    They cannot budge till your release. The king,
    His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
    And the remainder mourning over them,
    Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
    Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord, Gonzalo';
    His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
    From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em,
    That if you now beheld them, your affections
    Would become tender.

    PROS.                  Dost thou think so, spirit?

ARI. Mine would, sir, were I human.

    PROS.                  And mine shall.
    Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
    Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
    One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
    Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
    Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
    Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
    Do I take part: the rarer action is
    In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
    The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
    Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
    My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
    And they shall be themselves.


    [Illustration:

    PROSPERO:      '_You demi-puppets that
      By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make_' (page 125).]

    ARI.                   I'll fetch them, sir. [_Exit._

    PROS. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
    Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
    Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
    Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar: graves at my command
    Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure, and, when I have required
    Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.      [_Solemn music._

_Re-enter_ ARIEL _before: then_ ALONSO, _with a frantic gesture,
attended by_ GONZALO; SEBASTIAN _and_ ANTONIO _in like manner, attended
by_ ADRIAN _and_ FRANCISCO: _they all enter the circle which_ PROSPERO
_had made, and there stand charmed; which_ PROSPERO _observing, speaks_:

    A solemn air and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
    Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
    I will discase me, and myself present
    As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
    Thou shalt ere long be free.

    ARIEL _sings and helps to attire him_.

          Where the bee sucks, there suck I:
          In a cowslips bell I lie;
          There I couch when owls do cry.
          On the bat's back I do fly
          After summer merrily.
    Merrily, merrily shall I live now
    Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

    PROS. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;
    But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
    To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
    There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
    Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
    Being awake, enforce them to this place,
    And presently, I prithee.

    ARI. I drink the air before me, and return
    Or ere your pulse twice beat. [_Exit._

    GON. All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
    Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
    Out of this fearful country!

    PROS.                  Behold, sir king,
    The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
    For more assurance that a living prince
    Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
    And to thee and thy company I bid
    A hearty welcome.

    ALON.                  Whether thou be'st he or no,
    Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
    As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
    Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
    The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
    I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
    An if this be at all, a most strange story.
    Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
    Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
    Be living and be here?

    PROS.                  First, noble friend,
    Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
    Be measured or confined.

    GON.                   Whether this be
    Or be not, I'll not swear.

    PROS.                  You do yet taste
    Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
    Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!

    [_Aside to_ SEBASTIAN _and_ ANTONIO.]

    But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
    I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
    And justify you traitors: at this time
    I will tell no tales.

    SEB. [_aside._]   The devil speaks in him.

    PROS.                  No.
    For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
    Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
    Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
    My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
    Thou must restore.

[Illustration:

  PROSPERO: '_Graves at my command
    Have waked their sleepers_' (page 126).]

    ALON.                  If thou be'st Prospero,
    Give us particulars of thy preservation;
    How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
    Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
    How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
    My dear son Ferdinand.

    PROS.                  I am woe for't, sir.

    ALON. Irreparable is the loss, and patience
    Says it is past her cure.

    PROS.                  I rather think
    You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
    For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
    And rest myself content.

    ALON.                  You the like loss!

    PROS. As great to me as late; and, supportable
    To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
    Than you may call to comfort you, for I
    Have lost my daughter.

    ALON.                  A daughter?
    O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
    The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
    Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
    Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

    PROS. In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords
    At this encounter do so much admire
    That they devour their reason and scarce think
    Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
    Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
    Been justled from your senses, know for certain
    That I am Prospero and that very duke
    Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
    Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
    To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
    For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
    Not a relation for a breakfast, nor
    Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
    This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
    And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
    My dukedom since you have given me again,
    I will requite you with as good a thing;
    At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
    As much as me my dukedom.

_Here_ PROSPERO _discovers_ FERDINAND _and_ MIRANDA _playing at chess_.

MIR. Sweet lord, you play me false.

    FER.                   No, my dear'st love,
    I would not for the world.

    MIR. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
    And I would call it fair play.

    ALON.                  If this prove
    A vision of the island, one dear son
    Shall I twice lose.

    SEB.                   A most high miracle!

    FER. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
    I have cursed them without cause. [_Kneels._

    ALON.                  Now all the blessings
    Of a glad father compass thee about!
    Arise, and say how thou camest here.

    MIR.                   O, wonder!
    How many goodly creatures are there here!
    How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
    That has such people in't!

    PROS.                  'Tis new to thee.

    ALON. What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
    Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
    Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
    And brought us thus together?

    FER.                   Sir, she is mortal;
    But by immortal Providence she's mine:
    I chose her when I could not ask my father
    For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
    Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
    Of whom so often I have heard renown,
    But never saw before; of whom I have
    Received a second life; and second father
    This lady makes him to me.

    ALON.                  I am hers:
    But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
    Must ask my child forgiveness!

    PROS.                  There, sir, stop:
    Let us not burthen our remembrance with
    A heaviness that's gone.

    GON.                   I have inly wept,
    Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
    And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
    For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
    Which brought us hither.

    ALON.                  I say, Amen, Gonzalo!

    GON. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
    Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
    Beyond a common joy, and set it down
    With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
    Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
    And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
    Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
    In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves
    When no man was his own.

    ALON. [_to_ FER. _and_ MIR.] Give me your hands:
    Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
    That doth not wish you joy!

    GON.                   Be it so! Amen!

_Re-enter_ ARIEL, _with the_ MASTER _and_ Boatswain _amazedly
following_.

    O look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
    I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
    This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
    That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
    Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?

    BOATS. The best news is, that we have safely found
    Our king and company; the next, our ship--
    Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
    Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when
    We first put out to sea.

    ARI. [_aside to_ PROS.] Sir, all this service
    Have I done since I went.

[Illustration: BOATSWAIN: '_And were brought moping hither_' (page
137).]

PROS. [_aside to_ ARIEL.] My tricksy spirit!

    ALON. These are not natural events; they strengthen
    From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?

    BOATS. If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
    I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
    And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
    Where but even now with strange and several noises,
    Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
    And mo diversity of sounds, all horrible,
    We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
    Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
    Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
    Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
    Even in a dream, were we divided from them
    And were brought moping hither.

ARI. [_aside to_ PROS.] Was't well done?

    PROS. [_aside to_ ARIEL.] Bravely, my diligence.
    Thou shalt be free.

    ALON. This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;
    And there is in this business more than nature
    Was ever conduct of: some oracle
    Must rectify our knowledge.

    PROS.                  Sir, my liege,
    Do not infest your mind with beating on
    The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
    Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
    Which to you shall seem probable, of every
    These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
    And think of each thing well. [_Aside to_ ARIEL.]
    Come hither, spirit:
    Set Caliban and his companions free;
    Untie the spell. [_Exit_ ARIEL.]
    How fares my gracious sir?
    There are yet missing of your company
    Some few odd lads that you remember not.

_Re-enter_ ARIEL, _driving in_ CALIBAN, STEPHANO, _and_ TRINCULO, _in
their stolen apparel_.

STEPH. Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for
himself; for all is but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

TRIN. If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here's a goodly
sight.

    CAL. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
    How fine my master is! I am afraid
    He will chastise me.

    SEB.                   Ha, ha!
    What things are these, my lord Antonio?
    Will money buy 'em?

    ANT.                   Very like; one of them
    Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

    PROS. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
    Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
    His mother was a witch, and one so strong
    That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
    And deal in her command without her power.
    These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
    For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
    To take my life. Two of these fellows you
    Must know and own; this thing of darkness I
    Acknowledge mine.

    CAL.                   I shall be pinch'd to death.

ALON. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

SEB. He is drunk now: where had he wine?

    ALON. And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
    Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
    How camest thou in this pickle?

TRIN. I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear
me, will never out of my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.

SEB. Why, how now, Stephano!

STEPH. O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

PROS. You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?

STEPH. I should have been a sore one then.

ALON. This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.

[Illustration:

    PROSPERO: '_Calm seas, auspicious gales,
      And sail so expeditious_' (page 142).]

                                                [_Pointing to_ CALIBAN.

    PROS. He is as disproportion'd in his manners
    As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
    Take with you your companions; as you look
    To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

    CAL. Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
    And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
    Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
    And worship this dull fool!

    PROS.                  Go to; away!

    ALON. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

    SEB. Or stole it, rather.

                                    [_Exeunt_ CAL., STEPH., _and_ TRIN.

    PROS. Sir, I invite your highness and your train
    To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
    For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
    With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
    Go quick away; the story of my life
    And the particular accidents gone by
    Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
    I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
    Where I have hope to see the nuptial
    Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
    And thence retire me to my Milan, where
    Every third thought shall be my grave.

    ALON.                  I long
    To hear the story of your life, which must
    Take the ear strangely.

    PROS.                  I'll deliver all;
    And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
    And sail so expeditious that shall catch
    Your royal fleet far off. [_Aside to_ ARIEL.]
    My Ariel, chick,
    That is thy charge: then to the elements
    Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near. [_Exeunt._




EPILOGUE

SPOKEN BY PROSPERO


    Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
    And what strength I have's mine own,
    Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
    I must be here confined by you,
    Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
    Since I have my dukedom got
    And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
    In this bare island by your spell;
    But release me from my bands
    With the help of your good hands:
    Gentle breath of yours my sails
    Must fill, or else my project fails,
    Which was to please. Now I want
    Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
    And my ending is despair,
    Unless I be relieved by prayer,
    Which pierces so that it assaults
    Mercy itself and frees all faults.
    As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
    Let your indulgence set me free.

PREFACE


These stories have been written in the hopes of giving some pleasant
qualms to their reader, so that, if by chance, anyone may be occupying
in their perusal a leisure half-hour before he goes to bed when the
night and the house are still, he may perhaps cast an occasional glance
into the corners and dark places of the room where he sits, to make sure
that nothing unusual lurks in the shadow. For this is the avowed object
of ghost-stories and such tales as deal with the dim unseen forces which
occasionally and perturbingly make themselves manifest. The author
therefore fervently wishes his readers a few uncomfortable moments.

Some of those tales have appeared before in various magazines; the
remainder are new. One, the story of â€œThe Man who went too Far,â€ is the
germ of what subsequently developed into a book called â€œThe Angel of
Pain.â€

THE ROOM IN THE TOWER


It is probable that everybody who is at all a constant dreamer has had
at least one experience of an event or a sequence of circumstances which
have come to his mind in sleep being subsequently realised in the
material world. But, in my opinion, so far from this being a strange
thing, it would be far odder if this fulfilment did not occasionally
happen, since our dreams are, as a rule, concerned with people whom we
know and places with which we are familiar, such as might very naturally
occur in the awake and day-lit world. True, these dreams are often
broken into by some absurd and fantastic incident, which puts them out
of court in regard to their subsequent fulfilment, but on the mere
calculation of chances, it does not appear in the least unlikely that a
dream imagined by anyone who dreams constantly should occasionally come
true. Not long ago, for instance, I experienced such a fulfilment of a
dream which seems to me in no way remarkable and to have no kind of
psychical significance. The manner of it was as follows.

A certain friend of mine, living abroad, is amiable enough to write to
me about once in a fortnight. Thus, when fourteen days or thereabouts
have elapsed since I last heard from him, my mind, probably, either
consciously or subconsciously, is expectant of a letter from him. One
night last week I dreamed that as I was going upstairs to dress for
dinner I heard, as I often heard, the sound of the postmanâ€™s knock on my
front door, and diverted my direction downstairs instead. There, among
other correspondence, was a letter from him. Thereafter the fantastic
entered, for on opening it I found inside the ace of diamonds, and
scribbled across it in his well-known handwriting, â€œI am sending you
this for safe custody, as you know it is running an unreasonable risk to
keep aces in Italy.â€ The next evening I was just preparing to go
upstairs to dress when I heard the postmanâ€™s knock, and did precisely as
I had done in my dream. There, among other letters, was one from my
friend. Only it did not contain the ace of diamonds. Had it done so, I
should have attached more weight to the matter, which, as it stands,
seems to me a perfectly ordinary coincidence. No doubt I consciously or
subconsciously expected a letter from him, and this suggested to me my
dream. Similarly, the fact that my friend had not written to me for a
fortnight suggested to him that he should do so. But occasionally it is
not so easy to find such an explanation, and for the following story I
can find no explanation at all. It came out of the dark, and into the
dark it has gone again.

All my life I have been a habitual dreamer: the nights are few, that is
to say, when I do not find on awaking in the morning that some mental
experience has been mine, and sometimes, all night long, apparently, a
series of the most dazzling adventures befall me. Almost without
exception these adventures are pleasant, though often merely trivial. It
is of an exception that I am going to speak.

It was when I was about sixteen that a certain dream first came to me,
and this is how it befell. It opened with my being set down at the door
of a big red-brick house, where, I understood, I was going to stay. The
servant who opened the door told me that tea was going on in the garden,
and led me through a low dark-panelled hall, with a large open
fireplace, on to a cheerful green lawn set round with flower beds. There
were grouped about the tea-table a small party of people, but they were
all strangers to me except one, who was a school-fellow called Jack
Stone, clearly the son of the house, and he introduced me to his mother
and father and a couple of sisters. I was, I remember, somewhat
astonished to find myself here, for the boy in question was scarcely
known to me, and I rather disliked what I knew of him: moreover, he had
left school nearly a year before. The afternoon was very hot, and an
intolerable oppression reigned. On the far side of the lawn ran a
red-brick wall, with an iron gate in its centre, outside which stood a
walnut tree. We sat in the shadow of the house opposite a row of long
windows, inside which I could see a table with cloth laid, glimmering
with glass and silver. This garden front of the house was very long, and
at one end of it stood a tower of three stories, which looked to me much
older than the rest of the building.

Before long, Mrs Stone, who, like the rest of the party, had sat in
absolute silence, said to me, â€œJack will show you your room: I have
given you the room in the tower.â€

Quite inexplicably my heart sank at her words. I felt as if I had known
that I should have the room in the tower, and that it contained
something dreadful and significant. Jack instantly got up, and I
understood that I had to follow him. In silence we passed through the
hall, and mounted a great oak staircase with many corners, and arrived
at a small landing with two doors set in it. He pushed one of these open
for me to enter, and without coming in himself, closed it behind me.
Then I knew that my conjecture had been right: there was something awful
in the room, and with the terror of nightmare growing swiftly and
enveloping me, I awoke in a spasm of terror.

Now that dream or variations on it occurred to me intermittently for
fifteen years. Most often it came in exactly this form, the arrival, the
tea laid out on the lawn, the deadly silence succeeded by that one
deadly sentence, the mounting with Jack Stone up to the room in the
tower where horror dwelt, and it always came to a close in the nightmare
of terror at that which was in the room, though I never saw what it was.
At other times I experienced variations on this same theme.
Occasionally, for instance, we would be sitting at dinner in the
dining-room, into the windows of which I had looked on the first night
when the dream of this house visited me, but wherever we were, there was
the same silence, the same sense of dreadful oppression and foreboding.
And the silence I knew would always be broken by Mrs Stone saying to me,
â€œJack will show you your room: I have given you the room in the tower.â€
Upon which (this was invariable) I had to follow him up the oak
staircase with many corners, and enter the place that I dreaded more and
more each time that I visited it in sleep. Or, again, I would find
myself playing cards still in silence in a drawing-room lit with immense
chandeliers, that gave a blinding illumination. What the game was I have
no idea; what I remember, with a sense of miserable anticipation, was
that soon Mrs Stone would get up and say to me, â€œJack will show you your
room: I have given you the room in the tower.â€ This drawing-room where
we played cards was next to the dining-room, and, as I have said, was
always brilliantly illuminated, whereas the rest of the house was full
of dusk and shadows. And yet, how often, in spite of those bouquets of
lights, have I not pored over the cards that were dealed me, scarcely
able for some reason to see them. Their designs, too, were strange:
there were no red suits, but all were black, and among them there were
certain cards which were black all over. I hated and dreaded those.

As this dream continued to recur, I got to know the greater part of the
house. There was a smoking-room beyond the drawing-room, at the end of a
passage with a green baize door. It was always very dark there, and as
often as I went there I passed somebody whom I could not see in the
doorway coming out. Curious developments, too, took place in the
characters that peopled the dream as might happen to living persons. Mrs
Stone, for instance, who, when I first saw her, had been black haired,
became grey, and instead of rising briskly, as she had done at first
when she said, â€œJack will show you your room: I have given you the room
in the tower,â€ got up very feebly, as if the strength was leaving her
limbs. Jack also grew up, and became a rather ill-looking young man,
with a brown moustache, while one of the sisters ceased to appear, and I
understood she was married.

Then it so happened that I was not visited by this dream for six months
or more, and I began to hope, in such inexplicable dread did I hold it,
that it had passed away for good. But one night after this interval I
again found myself being shown out on to the lawn for tea, and Mrs Stone
was not there, while the others were all dressed in black. At once I
guessed the reason, and my heart leaped at the thought that perhaps this
time I should not have to sleep in the room in the tower, and though we
usually all sat in silence, on this occasion the sense of relief made me
talk and laugh as I had never yet done. But even then matters were not
altogether comfortable, for no one else spoke, but they all looked
secretly at each other. And soon the foolish stream of my talk ran dry,
and gradually an apprehension worse than anything I had previously known
gained on me as the light slowly faded.

Suddenly a voice which I knew well broke the stillness, the voice of Mrs
Stone, saying, â€œJack will show you your room: I have given you the room
in the tower.â€ It seemed to come from near the gate in the red-brick
wall that bounded the lawn, and looking up, I saw that the grass outside
was sown thick with gravestones. A curious greyish light shone from
them, and I could read the lettering on the grave nearest me, and it
was, â€œIn evil memory of Julia Stone.â€ And as usual Jack got up, and
again I followed him through the hall and up the staircase with many
corners. On this occasion it was darker than usual, and when I passed
into the room in the tower I could only just see the furniture, the
position of which was already familiar to me. Also there was a dreadful
odour of decay in the room, and I woke screaming.

The dream, with such variations and developments as I have mentioned,
went on at intervals for fifteen years. Sometimes I would dream it two
or three nights in succession; once, as I have said, there was an
intermission of six months, but taking a reasonable average, I should
say that I dreamed it quite as often as once in a month. It had, as is
plain, something of nightmare about it, since it always ended in the
same appalling terror, which so far from getting less, seemed to me to
gather fresh fear every time that I experienced it. There was, too, a
strange and dreadful consistency about it. The characters in it, as I
have mentioned, got regularly older, death and marriage visited this
silent family, and I never in the dream, after Mrs Stone had died, set
eyes on her again. But it was always her voice that told me that the
room in the tower was prepared for me, and whether we had tea out on the
lawn, or the scene was laid in one of the rooms overlooking it, I could
always see her gravestone standing just outside the iron gate. It was
the same, too, with the married daughter; usually she was not present,
but once or twice she returned again, in company with a man, whom I took
to be her husband. He, too, like the rest of them, was always silent.
But, owing to the constant repetition of the dream, I had ceased to
attach, in my waking hours, any significance to it. I never met Jack
Stone again during all those years, nor did I ever see a house that
resembled this dark house of my dream. And then something happened.

I had been in London in this year, up till the end of July, and during
the first week in August went down to stay with a friend in a house he
had taken for the summer months, in the Ashdown Forest district of
Sussex. I left London early, for John Clinton was to meet me at Forest
Row Station, and we were going to spend the day golfing, and go to his
house in the evening. He had his motor with him, and we set off, about
five of the afternoon, after a thoroughly delightful day, for the drive,
the distance being some ten miles. As it was still so early we did not
have tea at the club house, but waited till we should get home. As we
drove, the weather, which up till then had been, though hot, deliciously
fresh, seemed to me to alter in quality, and become very stagnant and
oppressive, and I felt that indefinable sense of ominous apprehension
that I am accustomed to before thunder. John, however, did not share my
views, attributing my loss of lightness to the fact that I had lost both
my matches. Events proved, however, that I was right, though I do not
think that the thunderstorm that broke that night was the sole cause of
my depression.

Our way lay through deep high-banked lanes, and before we had gone very
far I fell asleep, and was only awakened by the stopping of the motor.
And with a sudden thrill, partly of fear but chiefly of curiosity, I
found myself standing in the doorway of my house of dream. We went, I
half wondering whether or not I was dreaming still, through a low
oak-panelled hall, and out on to the lawn, where tea was laid in the
shadow of the house. It was set in flower beds, a red-brick wall, with a
gate in it, bounded one side, and out beyond that was a space of rough
grass with a walnut tree. The faÃ§ade of the house was very long, and at
one end stood a three-storied tower, markedly older than the rest.

Here for the moment all resemblance to the repeated dream ceased. There
was no silent and somehow terrible family, but a large assembly of
exceedingly cheerful persons, all of whom were known to me. And in spite
of the horror with which the dream itself had always filled me, I felt
nothing of it now that the scene of it was thus reproduced before me.
But I felt the intensest curiosity as to what was going to happen.

Tea pursued its cheerful course, and before long Mrs Clinton got up. And
at that moment I think I knew what she was going to say. She spoke to
me, and what she said was:

â€œJack will show you your room: I have given you the room in the tower.â€

At that, for half a second, the horror of the dream took hold of me
again. But it quickly passed, and again I felt nothing more than the
most intense curiosity. It was not very long before it was amply
satisfied.

John turned to me.

â€œRight up at the top of the house,â€ he said, â€œbut I think youâ€™ll be
comfortable. Weâ€™re absolutely full up. Would you like to go and see it
now? By Jove, I believe that you are right, and that we are going to
have a thunderstorm. How dark it has become.â€

I got up and followed him. We passed through the hall, and up the
perfectly familiar staircase. Then he opened the door, and I went in.
And at that moment sheer unreasoning terror again possessed me. I did
not know for certain what I feared: I simply feared. Then like a sudden
recollection, when one remembers a name which has long escaped the
memory, I knew what I feared. I feared Mrs Stone, whose grave with the
sinister inscription, â€œIn evil memory,â€ I had so often seen in my dream,
just beyond the lawn which lay below my window. And then once more the
fear passed so completely that I wondered what there was to fear, and I
found myself, sober and quiet and sane, in the room in the tower, the
name of which I had so often heard in my dream, and the scene of which
was so familiar.

I looked round it with a certain sense of proprietorship, and found that
nothing had been changed from the dreaming nights in which I knew it so
well. Just to the left of the door was the bed, lengthways along the
wall, with the head of it in the angle. In a line with it was the
fireplace and a small bookcase; opposite the door the outer wall was
pierced by two lattice-paned windows, between which stood the
dressing-table, while ranged along the fourth wall was the washing-stand
and a big cupboard. My luggage had already been unpacked, for the
furniture of dressing and undressing lay orderly on the wash-stand and
toilet-table, while my dinner clothes were spread out on the coverlet of
the bed. And then, with a sudden start of unexplained dismay, I saw that
there were two rather conspicuous objects which I had not seen before in
my dreams: one a life-sized oil-painting of Mrs Stone, the other a
black-and-white sketch of Jack Stone, representing him as he had
appeared to me only a week before in the last of the series of these
repeated dreams, a rather secret and evil-looking man of about thirty.
His picture hung between the windows, looking straight across the room
to the other portrait, which hung at the side of the bed. At that I
looked next, and as I looked I felt once more the horror of nightmare
seize me.

It represented Mrs Stone as I had seen her last in my dreams: old and
withered and white haired. But in spite of the evident feebleness of
body, a dreadful exuberance and vitality shone through the envelope of
flesh, an exuberance wholly malign, a vitality that foamed and frothed
with unimaginable evil. Evil beamed from the narrow, leering eyes; it
laughed in the demon-like mouth. The whole face was instinct with some
secret and appalling mirth; the hands, clasped together on the knee,
seemed shaking with suppressed and nameless glee. Then I saw also that
it was signed in the left-hand bottom corner, and wondering who the
artist could be, I looked more closely, and read the inscription, â€œJulia
Stone by Julia Stone.â€

There came a tap at the door, and John Clinton entered.

â€œGot everything you want?â€ he asked.

â€œRather more than I want,â€ said I, pointing to the picture.

He laughed.

â€œHard-featured old lady,â€ he said. â€œBy herself, too, I remember. Anyhow
she canâ€™t have flattered herself much.â€

â€œBut donâ€™t you see?â€ said I. â€œItâ€™s scarcely a human face at all. Itâ€™s
the face of some witch, of some devil.â€

He looked at it more closely.

â€œYes; it isnâ€™t very pleasant,â€ he said. â€œScarcely a bedside manner, eh?
Yes; I can imagine getting the nightmare if I went to sleep with that
close by my bed. Iâ€™ll have it taken down if you like.â€

â€œI really wish you would,â€ I said.

He rang the bell, and with the help of a servant we detached the
picture and carried it out on to the landing, and put it with its face
to the wall.

â€œBy Jove, the old lady is a weight,â€ said John, mopping his forehead. â€œI
wonder if she had something on her mind.â€

The extraordinary weight of the picture had struck me too. I was about
to reply, when I caught sight of my own hand. There was blood on it, in
considerable quantities, covering the whole palm.

â€œIâ€™ve cut myself somehow,â€ said I.

John gave a little startled exclamation.

â€œWhy, I have too,â€ he said.

Simultaneously the footman took out his handkerchief and wiped his hand
with it. I saw that there was blood also on his handkerchief.

John and I went back into the tower room and washed the blood off; but
neither on his hand nor on mine was there the slightest trace of a
scratch or cut. It seemed to me that, having ascertained this, we both,
by a sort of tacit consent, did not allude to it again. Something in my
case had dimly occurred to me that I did not wish to think about. It was
but a conjecture, but I fancied that I knew the same thing had occurred
to him.

The heat and oppression of the air, for the storm we had expected was
still undischarged, increased very much after dinner, and for some time
most of the party, among whom were John Clinton and myself, sat outside
on the path bounding the lawn, where we had had tea. The night was
absolutely dark, and no twinkle of star or moon ray could penetrate the
pall of cloud that overset the sky. By degrees our assembly thinned, the
women went up to bed, men dispersed to the smoking or billiard room, and
by eleven oâ€™clock my host and I were the only two left. All the evening
I thought that he had something on his mind, and as soon as we were
alone he spoke.

â€œThe man who helped us with the picture had blood on his hand, too, did
you notice?â€ he said. â€œI asked him just now if he had cut himself, and
he said he supposed he had, but that he could find no mark of it. Now
where did that blood come from?â€

By dint of telling myself that I was not going to think about it, I had
succeeded in not doing so, and I did not want, especially just at
bedtime, to be reminded of it.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said I, â€œand I donâ€™t really care so long as the picture
of Mrs Julia Stone is not by my bed.â€

He got up.

â€œBut itâ€™s odd,â€ he said. â€œHa! Now youâ€™ll see another odd thing.â€

A dog of his, an Irish terrier by breed, had come out of the house as we
talked. The door behind us into the hall was open, and a bright oblong
of light shone across the lawn to the iron gate which led on to the
rough grass outside, where the walnut tree stood. I saw that the dog
had all his hackles up, bristling with rage and fright; his lips were
curled back from his teeth, as if he was ready to spring at something,
and he was growling to himself. He took not the slightest notice of his
master or me, but stiffly and tensely walked across the grass to the
iron gate. There he stood for a moment, looking through the bars and
still growling. Then of a sudden his courage seemed to desert him: he
gave one long howl, and scuttled back to the house with a curious
crouching sort of movement.

â€œHe does that half-a-dozen times a day,â€ said John. â€œHe sees something
which he both hates and fears.â€

I walked to the gate and looked over it. Something was moving on the
grass outside, and soon a sound which I could not instantly identify
came to my ears. Then I remembered what it was: it was the purring of a
cat. I lit a match, and saw the purrer, a big blue Persian, walking
round and round in a little circle just outside the gate, stepping high
and ecstatically, with tail carried aloft like a banner. Its eyes were
bright and shining, and every now and then it put its head down and
sniffed at the grass.

I laughed.

â€œThe end of that mystery, I am afraid,â€ I said. â€œHereâ€™s a large cat
having Walpurgis night all alone.â€

â€œYes, thatâ€™s Darius,â€ said John. â€œHe spends half the day and all night
there. But thatâ€™s not the end of the dog mystery, for Toby and he are
the best of friends, but the beginning of the cat mystery. Whatâ€™s the
cat doing there? And why is Darius pleased, while Toby is
terror-stricken?â€

At that moment I remembered the rather horrible detail of my dreams when
I saw through the gate, just where the cat was now, the white tombstone
with the sinister inscription. But before I could answer the rain began,
as suddenly and heavily as if a tap had been turned on, and
simultaneously the big cat squeezed through the bars of the gate, and
came leaping across the lawn to the house for shelter. Then it sat in
the doorway, looking out eagerly into the dark. It spat and struck at
John with its paw, as he pushed it in, in order to close the door.

Somehow, with the portrait of Julia Stone in the passage outside, the
room in the tower had absolutely no alarm for me, and as I went to bed,
feeling very sleepy and heavy, I had nothing more than interest for the
curious incident about our bleeding hands, and the conduct of the cat
and dog. The last thing I looked at before I put out my light was the
square empty space by my bed where the portrait had been. Here the paper
was of its original full tint of dark red: over the rest of the walls it
had faded. Then I blew out my candle and instantly fell asleep.

My awaking was equally instantaneous, and I sat bolt upright in bed
under the impression that some bright light had been flashed in my face,
though it was now absolutely pitch dark. I knew exactly where I was, in
the room which I had dreaded in dreams, but no horror that I ever felt
when asleep approached the fear that now invaded and froze my brain.
Immediately after a peal of thunder crackled just above the house, but
the probability that it was only a flash of lightning which awoke me
gave no reassurance to my galloping heart. Something I knew was in the
room with me, and instinctively I put out my right hand, which was
nearest the wall, to keep it away. And my hand touched the edge of a
picture-frame hanging close to me.

I sprang out of bed, upsetting the small table that stood by it, and I
heard my watch, candle, and matches clatter on to the floor. But for the
moment there was no need of light, for a blinding flash leaped out of
the clouds, and showed me that by my bed again hung the picture of Mrs
Stone. And instantly the room went into blackness again. But in that
flash I saw another thing also, namely a figure that leaned over the end
of my bed, watching me. It was dressed in some close-clinging white
garment, spotted and stained with mould, and the face was that of the
portrait.

Overhead the thunder cracked and roared, and when it ceased and the
deathly stillness succeeded, I heard the rustle of movement coming
nearer me, and, more horrible yet, perceived an odour of corruption and
decay. And then a hand was laid on the side of my neck, and close beside
my ear I heard quick-taken, eager breathing. Yet I knew that this thing,
though it could be perceived by touch, by smell, by eye and by ear, was
still not of this earth, but something that had passed out of the body
and had power to make itself manifest. Then a voice, already familiar to
me, spoke.

â€œI knew you would come to the room in the tower,â€ it said. â€œI have been
long waiting for you. At last you have come. To-night I shall feast;
before long we will feast together.â€

And the quick breathing came closer to me; I could feel it on my neck.

At that the terror, which I think had paralyzed me for the moment, gave
way to the wild instinct of self-preservation. I hit wildly with both
arms, kicking out at the same moment, and heard a little animal-squeal,
and something soft dropped with a thud beside me. I took a couple of
steps forward, nearly tripping up over whatever it was that lay there,
and by the merest good-luck found the handle of the door. In another
second I ran out on the landing, and had banged the door behind me.
Almost at the same moment I heard a door open somewhere below, and John
Clinton, candle in hand, came running upstairs.

â€œWhat is it?â€ he said. â€œI sleep just below you, and heard a noise as
if--Good heavens, thereâ€™s blood on your shoulder.â€

I stood there, so he told me afterwards, swaying from side to side,
white as a sheet, with the mark on my shoulder as if a hand covered with
blood had been laid there.

â€œItâ€™s in there,â€ I said, pointing. â€œShe, you know. The portrait is in
there, too, hanging up on the place we took it from.â€

At that he laughed.

â€œMy dear fellow, this is mere nightmare,â€ he said.

He pushed by me, and opened the door, I standing there simply inert with
terror, unable to stop him, unable to move.

â€œPhew! What an awful smell,â€ he said.

Then there was silence; he had passed out of my sight behind the open
door. Next moment he came out again, as white as myself, and instantly
shut it.

â€œYes, the portraitâ€™s there,â€ he said, â€œand on the floor is a thing--a
thing spotted with earth, like what they bury people in. Come away,
quick, come away.â€

How I got downstairs I hardly know. An awful shuddering and nausea of
the spirit rather than of the flesh had seized me, and more than once he
had to place my feet upon the steps, while every now and then he cast
glances of terror and apprehension up the stairs. But in time we came
to his dressing-room on the floor below, and there I told him what I
have here described.

       *       *       *       *       *

The sequel can be made short; indeed, some of my readers have perhaps
already guessed what it was, if they remember that inexplicable affair
of the churchyard at West Fawley, some eight years ago, where an attempt
was made three times to bury the body of a certain woman who had
committed suicide. On each occasion the coffin was found in the course
of a few days again protruding from the ground. After the third attempt,
in order that the thing should not be talked about, the body was buried
elsewhere in unconsecrated ground. Where it was buried was just outside
the iron gate of the garden belonging to the house where this woman had
lived. She had committed suicide in a room at the top of the tower in
that house. Her name was Julia Stone.

Subsequently the body was again secretly dug up, and the coffin was
found to be full of blood.




THE DUST-CLOUD


The big French windows were open on to the lawn, and, dinner being over,
two or three of the party who were staying for the week at the end of
August with the Combe-Martins had strolled out on to the terrace to look
at the sea, over which the moon, large and low, was just rising and
tracing a path of pale gold from horizon to shore, while others, less
lunar of inclination, had gone in search of bridge or billiards. Coffee
had come round immediately after dessert, and the end of dinner,
according to the delectable custom of the house, was as informal as the
end of breakfast. Every one, that is to say, remained or went away,
smoked, drank port or abstained, according to his personal tastes. Thus,
on this particular evening it so happened that Harry Combe-Martin and I
were very soon left alone in the dining-room, because we were talking
unmitigated motor â€œshop,â€ and the rest of the party (small wonder) were
bored with it, and had left us. The shop was home-shop, so to speak, for
it was almost entirely concerned with the manifold perfections of the
new six-cylinder Napier which my host in a moment of extravagance, which
he did not in the least regret, had just purchased; in which, too, he
proposed to take me over to lunch at a friendâ€™s house near Hunstanton on
the following day. He observed with legitimate pride that an early start
would not be necessary as the distance was only eighty miles and there
were no police traps.

â€œQueer things these big motors are,â€ he said, relapsing into
generalities as we rose to go. â€œOften I can scarcely believe that my new
car is merely a machine. It seems to me to possess an independent life
of its own. It is really much more like a thoroughbred with a
wonderfully fine mouth.â€

â€œAnd the moods of a thoroughbred?â€ I asked.

â€œNo; itâ€™s got an excellent temper, Iâ€™m glad to say. It doesnâ€™t mind
being checked, or even stopped, when itâ€™s going its best. Some of these
big cars canâ€™t stand that. They get sulky--I assure you it is literally
true--if they are checked too often.â€

He paused on his way to ring the bell. â€œGuy Elphinstoneâ€™s car, for
instance,â€ he said: â€œit was a bad-tempered brute, a violent, vicious
beast of a car.â€

â€œWhat make?â€ I asked.

â€œTwenty-five horse-power AmÃ©dÃ©e. They are a fretful strain of car; too
thin, not enough bone--and bone is very good for the nerves. The brute
liked running over a chicken or a rabbit, though perhaps it was less the
carâ€™s ill-temper than Guyâ€™s, poor chap. Well, he paid for it--he paid
to the uttermost farthing. Did you know him?â€

â€œNo; but surely I have heard the name. Ah, yes, he ran over a child, did
he not?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Harry, â€œand then smashed up against his own park gates.â€

â€œKilled, wasnâ€™t he?â€

â€œOh yes, killed instantly, and the car just a heap of splinters. Thereâ€™s
an odd story about it, Iâ€™m told, in the village: rather in your line.â€

â€œGhosts?â€ I asked.

â€œYes, the ghost of his motor-car. Seems almost too up-to-date, doesnâ€™t
it?â€

â€œAnd whatâ€™s the story?â€ I demanded.

â€œWhy, just this. His place was outside the village of Bircham, ten miles
out from Norwich; and thereâ€™s a long straight bit of road there--thatâ€™s
where he ran over the child--and a couple of hundred yards farther on, a
rather awkward turn into the park gates. Well, a month or two ago, soon
after the accident, one old gaffer in the village swore he had seen a
motor there coming full tilt along the road, but without a sound, and it
disappeared at the lodge gates of the park, which were shut. Soon after
another said he had heard a motor whirl by him at the same place,
followed by a hideous scream, but he saw nothing.â€

â€œThe scream is rather horrible,â€ said I.

â€œAh, I see what you mean! I only thought of his syren. Guy had a syren
on his exhaust, same as I have. His had a dreadful frightened sort of
wail, and always made me feel creepy.â€

â€œAnd is that all the story?â€ I asked: â€œthat one old man thought he saw a
noiseless motor, and another thought he heard an invisible one?â€

Harry flicked the ash off his cigarette into the grate. â€œOh dear no!â€ he
said. â€œHalf a dozen of them have seen something or heard something. It
is quite a heavily authenticated yarn.â€

â€œYes, and talked over and edited in the public-house,â€ I said.

â€œWell, not a man of them will go there after dark. Also the lodge-keeper
gave notice a week or two after the accident. He said he was always
hearing a motor stop and hoot outside the lodge, and he was kept running
out at all hours of the night to see what it was.â€

â€œAnd what was it?â€

â€œIt wasnâ€™t anything. Simply nothing there. He thought it rather uncanny,
anyhow, and threw up a good post. Besides, his wife was always hearing a
child scream, and while her man toddled out to the gate she would go and
see whether the kids were all right. And the kids themselves----â€

â€œAh, what of them?â€ I asked.

â€œThey kept coming to their mother, asking who the little girl was who
walked up and down the road and would not speak to them or play with
them.â€

â€œItâ€™s a many-sided story,â€ I said. â€œAll the witnesses seem to have heard
and seen different things.â€

â€œYes, that is just what to my mind makes the yarn so good,â€ he said.
â€œPersonally I donâ€™t take much stock in spooks at all. But given that
there are such things as spooks, and given that the death of the child
and the death of Guy have caused spooks to play about there, it seems to
me a very good point that different people should be aware of different
phenomena. One hears the car, another sees it, one hears the child
scream, another sees the child. How does that strike you?â€

This, I am bound to say, was a new view to me, and the more I thought of
it the more reasonable it appeared. For the vast majority of mankind
have all those occult senses by which is perceived the spiritual world
(which, I hold, is thick and populous around us), sealed up, as it were;
in other words, the majority of mankind never hear or see a ghost at
all. Is it not, then, very probable that of the remainder--those, in
fact, to whom occult experiences have happened or can happen--few should
have every sense unsealed, but that some should have the unsealed ear,
others the unsealed eye--that some should be clairaudient, others
clairvoyant?

â€œYes, it strikes me as reasonable,â€ I said. â€œCanâ€™t you take me over
there?â€

â€œCertainly! If you will stop till Friday Iâ€™ll take you over on
Thursday. The others all go that day, so that we can get there after
dark.â€

I shook my head. â€œI canâ€™t stop till Friday, Iâ€™m afraid,â€ I said. â€œI must
leave on Thursday. But how about to-morrow? Canâ€™t we take it on the way
to or from Hunstanton?â€

â€œNo; itâ€™s thirty miles out of our way. Besides, to be at Bircham after
dark means that we shouldnâ€™t get back here till midnight. And as host to
my guests----â€

â€œAh! things are only heard and seen after dark, are they?â€ I asked.
â€œThat makes it so much less interesting. It is like a sÃ©ance where all
lights are put out.â€

â€œWell, the accident happened at night,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t know the
rules, but that may have some bearing on it, I should think.â€

I had one question more in the back of my mind, but I did not like to
ask it. At least, I wanted information on this subject without appearing
to ask for it.

â€œNeither do I know the rules of motors,â€ I said; â€œand I donâ€™t understand
you when you say that Guy Elphinstoneâ€™s machine was an irritable,
cross-grained brute, that liked running over chickens and rabbits. But I
think you subsequently said that the irritability may have been the
irritability of its owner. Did he mind being checked?â€

â€œIt made him blind-mad if it happened often,â€ said Harry. â€œI shall never
forget a drive I had with him once: there were hay-carts and
perambulators every hundred yards. It was perfectly ghastly; it was like
being with a madman. And when we got inside his gate, his dog came
running out to meet him. He did not go an inch out of his course: it was
worse than that--he went for it, just grinding his teeth with rage. I
never drove with him again.â€

He stopped a moment, guessing what might be in my mind. â€œI say, you
mustnâ€™t think--you mustnâ€™t think----â€ he began.

â€œNo, of course not,â€ said I.

Harry Combe-Martinâ€™s house stood close to the weather-eaten, sandy
cliffs of the Suffolk shore, which are being incessantly gnawed away by
the hunger of the insatiable sea. Fathoms deep below it, and now many
hundred yards out, lies what was once the second port in England; but
now of the ancient town of Dunwich, and of its seven great churches,
nothing remains but one, and that ruinous and already half destroyed by
the falling cliff and the encroachments of the sea. Foot by foot, it too
is disappearing, and of the graveyard which surrounded it more than half
is gone, so that from the face of the sandy cliff on which it stands
there stick out like straws in glass, as Dante says, the bones of those
who were once committed there to the kindly and stable earth.

Whether it was the remembrance of this rather grim spectacle as I had
seen it that afternoon, or whether Harryâ€™s story had caused some
trouble in my brain, or whether it was merely that the keen bracing air
of this place, to one who had just come from the sleepy languor of the
Norfolk Broads, kept me sleepless, I do not know; but, anyhow, the
moment I put out my light that night and got into bed, I felt that all
the footlights and gas-jets in the internal theatre of my mind sprang
into flame, and that I was very vividly and alertly awake. It was in
vain that I counted a hundred forwards and a hundred backwards, that I
pictured to myself a flock of visionary sheep coming singly through a
gap in an imaginary hedge, and tried to number their monotonous and
uniform countenances, that I played noughts and crosses with myself,
that I marked out scores of double lawn-tennis courts,--for with each
repetition of these supposedly soporific exercises I only became more
intensely wakeful. It was not in remote hope of sleep that I continued
to repeat these weary performances long after their inefficacy was
proved to the hilt, but because I was strangely unwilling in this
timeless hour of the night to think about those protruding relics of
humanity; also I quite distinctly did not desire to think about that
subject with regard to which I had, a few hours ago, promised Harry that
I would not make it the subject of reflection. For these reasons I
continued during the black hours to practise these narcotic exercises of
the mind, knowing well that if I paused on the tedious treadmill my
thoughts, like some released spring, would fly back to rather gruesome
subjects. I kept my mind, in fact, talking loud to itself, so that it
should not hear what other voices were saying.

Then by degrees these absurd mental occupations became impossible; my
mind simply refused to occupy itself with them any longer; and next
moment I was thinking intently and eagerly, not about the bones
protruding from the gnawed section of sand-cliff, but about the subject
I had said I would not dwell upon. And like a flash it came upon me why
Harry had bidden me not think about it. Surely in order that I should
not come to the same conclusion as he had come to.

Now the whole question of â€œhauntâ€--haunted spots, haunted houses, and so
forth--has always seemed to me to be utterly unsolved, and to be neither
proved nor disproved to a satisfactory degree. From the earliest times,
certainly from the earliest known Egyptian records, there has been a
belief that the scene of a crime is often revisited, sometimes by the
spirit of him who has committed it--seeking rest, we must suppose, and
finding none; sometimes, and more inexplicably, by the spirit of his
victim, crying perhaps, like the blood of Abel, for vengeance. And
though the stories of these village gossips in the alehouse about
noiseless visions and invisible noises were all as yet unsifted and
unreliable, yet I could not help wondering if they (such as they were)
pointed to something authentic and to be classed under this head of
appearances. But more striking than the yarns of the gaffers seemed to
me the questions of the lodge-keeperâ€™s children. How should children
have imagined the figure of a child that would not speak to them or play
with them? Perhaps it was a real child, a sulky child. Yes--perhaps. But
perhaps not. Then after this preliminary skirmish I found myself
settling down to the question that I had said I would not think about;
in other words, the possible origin of these phenomena interested me
more than the phenomena themselves. For what exactly had Guy
Elphinstone, that savage driver, done? Had or had not the death of the
child been entirely an accident, a thing (given he drove a motor at all)
outside his own control? Or had he, irritated beyond endurance at the
checks and delays of the day, not pulled up when it was just possible he
might have, but had run over the child as he would have run over a
rabbit or a hen, or even his own dog? And what, in any case, poor
wretched brute, must have been his thoughts in that terrible instant
that intervened between the childâ€™s death and his own, when a moment
later he smashed into the closed gates of his own lodge? Was remorse
his--bitter, despairing contrition? That could hardly have been so; or
else surely, knowing only for certain that he had knocked a child down,
he would have stopped; he would have done his best, whatever that might
be, to repair the irreparable harm. But he had not stopped: he had gone
on, it seemed, at full speed, for on the collision the car had been
smashed into matchwood and steel shavings. Again, with double force, had
this dreadful thing been a complete accident, he would have stopped. So
then--most terrible question of all--had he, after making murder, rushed
on to what proved to be his own death, filled with some hellish glee at
what he had done? Indeed, as in the churchyard on the cliff, bones of
the buried stuck starkly out into the night.

       *       *       *       *       *

The pale tired light of earliest morning had turned the window-blinds
into glimmering squares before I slept; and when I woke, the servant who
called me was already rattling them briskly up on their rollers, and
letting the calm serenity of the August day stream into the room.
Through the open windows poured in sunlight and sea-wind, the scent of
flowers and the song of birds; and each and all were wonderfully
reassuring, banishing the hooded forms that had haunted the night, and I
thought of the disquietude of the dark hours as a traveller may think of
the billows and tempests of the ocean over which he has safely
journeyed, unable, now that they belong to the limbo of the past, to
recall his qualms and tossings with any vivid uneasiness. Not without a
feeling of relief, too, did I dwell on the knowledge that I was
definitely not going to visit this equivocal spot. Our drive to-day, as
Harry had said, would not take us within thirty miles of it, and
to-morrow I but went to the station and away. Though a thorough-paced
seeker after truth might, no doubt, have regretted that the laws of time
and space did not permit him to visit Bircham after the sinister dark
had fallen, and test whether for him there was visible or audible truth
in the tales of the village gossips, I was conscious of no such regret.
Bircham and its fables had given me a very bad night, and I was
perfectly aware that I did not in the least want to go near it, though
yesterday I had quite truthfully said I should like to do so. In this
brightness, too, of sun and sea-wind I felt none of the _malaise_ at my
waking moments which a sleepless night usually gives me; I felt
particularly well, particularly pleased to be alive, and also, as I have
said, particularly content not to be going to Bircham. I was quite
satisfied to leave my curiosity unsatisfied.

       *       *       *       *       *

The motor came round about eleven, and we started at once, Harry and Mrs
Morrison, a cousin of his, sitting behind in the big back seat, large
enough to hold a comfortable three, and I on the left of the driver, in
a sort of trance--I am not ashamed to confess it--of expectancy and
delight. For this was in the early days of motors, when there was still
the sense of romance and adventure round them. I did not want to drive,
any more than Harry wanted to; for driving, so I hold, is too absorbing;
it takes the attention in too firm a grip: the mania of the true
motorist is not consciously enjoyed. For the passion for motors is a
taste--I had almost said a gift--as distinct and as keenly individual as
the passion for music or mathematics. Those who use motors most (merely
as a means of getting rapidly from one place to another) are often
entirely without it, while those whom adverse circumstances (over which
they have no control) compel to use them least may have it to a supreme
degree. To those who have it, analysis of their passion is perhaps
superfluous; to those who have it not, explanation is almost
unintelligible. Pace, however, and the control of pace, and above all
the sensuous consciousness of pace, is at the root of it; and pleasure
in pace is common to most people, whether it be in the form of a
galloping horse, or the pace of the skate hissing over smooth ice, or
the pace of a free-wheel bicycle humming down-hill, or, more
impersonally, the pace of the smashed ball at lawn-tennis, the driven
ball at golf, or the low boundary hit at cricket. But the sensuous
consciousness of pace, as I have said, is needful: one might experience
it seated in front of the engine of an express train, though not in a
wadded, shut-windowed carriage, where the wind of movement is not felt.
Then add to this rapture of the rush through riven air the knowledge
that huge relentless force is controlled by a little lever, and
directed by a little wheel on which the hands of the driver seem to lie
so negligently. A great untamed devil has there his bridle, and he
answers to it, as Harry had said, like a horse with a fine mouth. He has
hunger and thirst, too, unslakeable, and greedily he laps of his soup of
petrol which turns to fire in his mouth: electricity, the force that
rends clouds asunder, and causes towers to totter, is the spoon with
which he feeds himself; and as he eats he races onward, and the road
opens like torn linen in front of him. Yet how obedient, how amenable is
he!--for with a touch on his snaffle his speed is redoubled, or melts
into thin air, so that before you know you have touched the rein he has
exchanged his swallow-flight for a mere saunter through the lanes. But
he ever loves to run; and knowing this, you will bid him lift up his
voice and tell those who are in his path that he is coming, so that he
will not need the touch that checks. Hoarse and jovial is his voice,
hooting to the wayfarer; and if his hooting be not heard he has a great
guttural falsetto scream that leaps from octave to octave, and echoes
from the hedges that are passing in blurred lines of hanging green. And,
as you go, the romantic isolation of divers in deep seas is yours;
masked and hooded companions may be near you also, in their
driving-dress for this plunge through the swift tides of air; but you,
like them, are alone and isolated, conscious only of the ripped riband
of road, the two great lantern-eyes of the wonderful monster that look
through drooped eyelids by day, but gleam with fire by night, the two
ear-laps of splash-boards, and the long lean bonnet in front which is
the skull and brain-case of that swift, untiring energy that feeds on
fire, and whirls its two tons of weight up hill and down dale, as if
some new law as everlasting as gravity, and like gravity making it go
ever swifter, was its sole control.

For the first hour the essence of these joys, any description of which
compared to the real thing is but as a stagnant pond compared to the
bright rushing of a mountain stream, was mine. A straight switchback
road lay in front of us, and the monster plunged silently down hill, and
said below his breath, â€œHa-ha--ha-ha--ha-ha,â€ as, without diminution of
speed, he breasted the opposing slope. In my control were his great
vocal chords (for in those days hooter and syren were on the driverâ€™s
left, and lay convenient, to the hand of him who occupied the box-seat),
and it rejoiced me to let him hoot to a pony-cart, three hundred yards
ahead, with a hand on his falsetto scream if his ordinary tones of
conversation were unheard or disregarded. Then came a road crossing ours
at right angles, and the dear monster seemed to say, â€œYes, yes,--see how
obedient and careful I am. I stroll with my hands in my pockets.â€ Then
again a puppy from a farmhouse staggered warlike into the road, and the
monster said, â€œPoor little chap! get home to your mother, or Iâ€™ll talk
to you in earnest.â€ The poor little chap did not take the hint, so the
monster slackened speed and just said, â€œWhoof!â€ Then it chuckled to
itself as the puppy scuttled into the hedge, seriously alarmed; and next
moment our self-made wind screeched and whistled round us again.

Napoleon, I believe, said that the power of an army lay in its feet:
that is true also of the monster. There was a loud bang, and in thirty
seconds we were at a standstill. The monsterâ€™s off fore-foot troubled
it, and the chauffeur said, â€œYes, sir,--burst.â€

So the burst boot was taken off and a new one put on, a boot that had
never been on foot before. The foot in question was held up on a jack
during this operation, and the new boot laced up with a pump. This took
exactly twenty-five minutes. Then the monster got his spoon going again,
and said, â€œLet me run: oh, let me run!â€ And for fifteen miles on a
straight and empty road it ran. I timed the miles, but shall not produce
their chronology for the benefit of a forsworn constabulary.

But there were no more dithyrambics that morning. We should have reached
Hunstanton in time for lunch. Instead, we waited to repair our fourth
puncture at 1.45 P.M., twenty-five miles short of our destination. This
fourth puncture was caused by a spicule of flint three-quarters of an
inch long--sharp, it is true, but weighing perhaps two pennyweights,
while we weighed two tons. It seemed an impertinence. So we lunched at a
wayside inn, and during lunch the pundits held a consultation, of which
the upshot was this:

We had no more boots for our monster, for his off fore-foot had burst
once, and punctured once (thus necessitating two socks and one boot).
Similarly, but more so, his off hind-foot had burst twice (thus
necessitating two boots and two socks). Now, there was no certain
shoemakerâ€™s shop at Hunstanton, as far as we knew, but there was a
regular universal store at Kingâ€™s Lynn, which was about equidistant.

And, so said the chauffeur, there was something wrong with the monsterâ€™s
spoon (ignition), and he didnâ€™t rightly know what, and therefore it
seemed the prudent part not to go to Hunstanton (lunch, a thing of the
preterite, having been the object), but to the well-supplied Kingâ€™s
Lynn. And we all breathed a pious hope that we might get there.

Whizz: hoot: purr! The last boot held, the spoon went busily to the
monsterâ€™s mouth, and we just flowed into Kingâ€™s Lynn. The return
journey, so I vaguely gathered, would be made by other roads; but
personally, intoxicated with air and movement, I neither asked nor
desired to know what those roads would be. This one small but rather
salient fact is necessary to record here, that as we waited at Kingâ€™s
Lynn, and as we buzzed homewards afterwards, no thought of Bircham
entered my head at all. The subsequent hallucination, if hallucination
it was, was not, as far as I know, self-suggested. That we had gone out
of our way for the sake of the garage, I knew, and that was all. Harry
also told me that he did not know where our road would take us.

The rest that follows is the baldest possible narrative of what actually
occurred. But it seems to me, a humble student of the occult, to be
curious.

While we waited we had tea in a hotel looking on to a big empty square
of houses, and after tea we waited a very long time for our monster to
pick us up. Then the telephone from the garage inquired for â€œthe
gentleman on the motor,â€ and since Harry had strolled out to get a local
evening paper with news of the last Test Match, I applied ear and mouth
to that elusive instrument. What I heard was not encouraging: the
ignition had gone very wrong indeed, and â€œperhapsâ€ in an hour we should
be able to start. It was then about half-past six, and we were just
seventy-eight miles from Dunwich.

Harry came back soon after this, and I told him what the message from
the garage had been. What he said was this: â€œThen we shanâ€™t get back
till long after dinner. We might just as well have camped out to see
your ghost.â€

As I have already said, no notion of Bircham was in my mind, and I
mention this as evidence that, even if it had been, Harryâ€™s remark
would have implied that we were not going through Bircham.

The hour lengthened itself into an hour and a half. Then the monster,
quite well again, came hooting round the corner, and we got in.

â€œWhack her up, Jack,â€ said Harry to the chauffeur. â€œThe roads will be
empty. You had better light up at once.â€

The monster, with its eyes agleam, was whacked up, and never in my life
have I been carried so cautiously and yet so swiftly. Jack never took a
risk or the possibility of a risk, but when the road was clear and open
he let the monster run just as fast as it was able. Its eyes made day of
the road fifty yards ahead, and the romance of night was fairyland round
us. Hares started from the roadside, and raced in front of us for a
hundred yards, then just wheeled in time to avoid the ear-flaps of the
great triumphant brute that carried us. Moths flitted across, struck
sometimes by the lenses of its eyes, and the miles peeled over our
shoulders. When It occurred we were going top-speed. And this was
It--quite unsensational, but to us quite inexplicable unless my midnight
imaginings happened to be true.

As I have said, I was in command of the hooter and of the syren. We were
flying along on a straight down-grade, as fast as ever we could go, for
the engines were working, though the decline was considerable. Then
quite suddenly I saw in front of us a thick cloud of dust, and knew
instinctively and on the instant, without thought or reasoning, what
that must mean. Evidently something going very fast (or else so large a
cloud could not have been raised) was in front of us, and going in the
same direction as ourselves. Had it been something on the road coming to
meet us, we should of course have seen the vehicle first and run into
the dust-cloud afterwards. Had it, again, been something of low speed--a
horse and dog-cart, for instance--no such dust could have been raised.
But, as it was, I knew at once that there was a motor travelling swiftly
just ahead of us, also that it was not going as fast as we were, or we
should have run into its dust much more gradually. But we went into it
as into a suddenly lowered curtain.

Then I shouted to Jack. â€œSlow down, and put on the brake,â€ I shrieked.
â€œThereâ€™s something just ahead of us.â€

As I spoke I wrought a wild concerto on the hooter, and with my right
hand groped for the syren, but did not find it. Simultaneously I heard a
wild, frightened shriek, just as if I had sounded the syren myself. Jack
had felt for it too, and our hands fingered each other. Then we entered
the dust-cloud.

We slowed down with extraordinary rapidity, and still peering ahead we
went dead-slow through it. I had not put on my goggles after leaving
Kingâ€™s Lynn, and the dust stung and smarted in my eyes. It was not,
therefore, a belt of fog, but real road-dust. And at the moment we crept
through it I felt Harryâ€™s hands on my shoulder.

â€œThereâ€™s something just ahead,â€ he said. â€œLook! donâ€™t you see the tail
light?â€

As a matter of fact, I did not; and, still going very slow, we came out
of that dust-cloud. The broad empty road stretched in front of us; a
hedge was on each side, and there was no turning either to right or
left. Only, on the right, was a lodge, and gates which were closed. The
lodge had no lights in any window.

Then we came to a standstill; the air was dead-calm, not a leaf in the
hedgerow trees was moving, not a grain of dust was lifted from the road.
But, behind, the dust-cloud still hung in the air, and stopped
dead-short at the closed lodge-gates. We had moved very slowly for the
last hundred yards: it was difficult to suppose that it was of our
making. Then Jack spoke, with a curious crack in his voice.

â€œIt must have been a motor, sir,â€ he said. â€œBut where is it?â€

I had no reply to this, and from behind another voice, Harryâ€™s voice,
spoke. For the moment I did not recognise it, for it was strained and
faltering.

â€œDid you open the syren?â€ he asked. â€œIt didnâ€™t sound like our syren. It
sounded like, like----â€

â€œI didnâ€™t open the syren,â€ said I.

Then we went on again. Soon we came to scattered lights in houses by the
wayside.

â€œWhatâ€™s this place?â€ I asked Jack.

â€œBircham, sir,â€ said he.




GAVONâ€™S EVE


It is only the largest kind of ordnance map that records the existence
of the village of Gavon, in the shire of Sutherland, and it is perhaps
surprising that any map on whatever scale should mark so small and
huddled a group of huts, set on a bare, bleak headland between moor and
sea, and, so one would have thought, of no import at all to any who did
not happen to live there. But the river Gavon, on the right bank of
which stand this half-dozen of chimneyless and wind-swept habitations,
is a geographical fact of far greater interest to outsiders, for the
salmon there are heavy fish, the mouth of the river is clear of nets,
and all the way up to Gavon Loch, some six miles inland, the
coffee-coloured water lies in pool after deep pool, which verge, if the
river is in order and the angler moderately sanguine, on a fishing
probability amounting almost to a certainty. In any case during the
first fortnight of September last I had no blank day on those delectable
waters, and up till the 15th of that month there was no day on which
some one at the lodge in which I was stopping did not land a fish out of
the famous Pictsâ€™ pool. But after the 15th that pool was not fished
again. The reason why is here set forward.

The river at this point, after some hundred yards of rapid, makes a
sudden turn round a rocky angle, and plunges madly into the pool itself.
Very deep water lies at the head of it, but deeper still further down on
the east side, where a portion of the stream flicks back again in a
swift dark backwater towards the top of the pool again. It is fishable
only from the western bank, for to the east, above this backwater, a
great wall of black and basaltic rock, heaved up no doubt by some fault
in strata, rises sheer from the river to the height of some sixty feet.
It is in fact nearly precipitous on both sides, heavily serrated at the
top, and of so curious a thinness, that at about the middle of it where
a fissure breaks its topmost edge, and some twenty feet from the top,
there exists a long hole, a sort of lancet window, one would say, right
through the rock, so that a slit of daylight can be seen through it.
Since, therefore, no one would care to cast his line standing perched on
that razor-edged eminence, the pool must needs be fished from the
western bank. A decent fly, however, will cover it all.

It is on the western bank that there stand the remains of that which
gave its title to the pool, namely, the ruins of a Pict castle, built
out of rough and scarcely hewn masonry, unmortared but on a certain
large and impressive scale, and in a very well-preserved condition
considering its extreme antiquity. It is circular in shape and measures
some twenty yards of diameter in its internal span. A staircase of large
blocks with a rise of at least a foot leads up to the main gate, and
opposite this on the side towards the river is another smaller postern
through which down a rather hazardously steep slope a scrambling path,
where progress demands both caution and activity, conducts to the head
of the pool which lies immediately beneath it. A gate-chamber still
roofed over exists in the solid wall: inside there are foundation
indications of three rooms, and in the centre of all a very deep hole,
probably a well. Finally, just outside the postern leading to the river
is a small artificially levelled platform, some twenty feet across, as
if made to support some super-incumbent edifice. Certain stone slabs and
blocks are dispersed over it.

Brora, the post-town of Gavon, lies some six miles to the south-west,
and from it a track over the moor leads to the rapids immediately above
the Pictsâ€™ pool, across which by somewhat extravagant striding from
boulder to boulder a man can pass dry-foot when the river is low, and
make his way up a steep path to the north of the basaltic rock, and so
to the village. But this transit demands a steady head, and at the best
is a somewhat giddy passage. Otherwise the road between it and Brora
lies in a long detour higher up the moor, passing by the gates of Gavon
Lodge, where I was stopping. For some vague and ill-defined reason the
pool itself and the Pictsâ€™ Castle had an uneasy reputation on the
country side, and several times trudging back from a dayâ€™s fishing I
have known my gillie take a longish circuit, though heavy with fish,
rather than make this short cut in the dusk by the castle. On the first
occasion when Sandy, a strapping yellow-bearded viking of twenty-five,
did this he gave as a reason that the ground round about the castle was
â€œmossy,â€ though as a God-fearing man, he must have known he lied. But on
another occasion he was more frank, and said that the Pictsâ€™ pool was
â€œno cannyâ€ after sunset. I am now inclined to agree with him, though,
when he lied about it, I think it was because as a God-fearing man he
feared the devil also.

It was on the evening of September 14 that I was walking back with my
host, Hugh Graham, from the forest beyond the lodge. It had been a day
unseasonably hot for the time of year, and the hills were blanketed with
soft, furry clouds. Sandy, the gillie of whom I have spoken, was behind
with the ponies, and, idly enough, I told Hugh about his strange
distaste for the Pictsâ€™ pool after sunset. He listened, frowning a
little.

â€œThatâ€™s curious,â€ he said. â€œI know there is some dim local superstition
about the place, but last year certainly Sandy used to laugh at it. I
remember asking him what ailed the place, and he said he thought
nothing about the rubbish folk talked. But this year you say he avoids
it.â€

â€œOn several occasions with me he has done so.â€

Hugh smoked a while in silence, striding noiselessly over the dusky
fragrant heather.

â€œPoor chap,â€ he said, â€œI donâ€™t know what to do about him. Heâ€™s becoming
useless.â€

â€œDrink?â€ I asked.

â€œYes, drink in a secondary manner. But trouble led to drink, and
trouble, I am afraid, is leading him to worse than drink.â€

â€œThe only thing worse than drink is the devil,â€ I remarked.

â€œPrecisely. Thatâ€™s where he is going. He goes there often.â€

â€œWhat on earth do you mean?â€ I asked.

â€œWell, itâ€™s rather curious,â€ said Hugh. â€œYou know I dabble a bit in
folklore and local superstition, and I believe I am on the track of
something odder than odd. Just wait a moment.â€

We stood there in the gathering dusk till the ponies laboured up the
hillside to us, Sandy with his six feet of lithe strength strolling
easily beside them up the steep brae, as if his long dayâ€™s trudging had
but served to half awaken his dormant powers of limb.

â€œGoing to see Mistress Macpherson again to-night?â€ asked Hugh.

â€œAye, puir body,â€ said Sandy. â€œSheâ€™s auld, and sheâ€™s lone.â€

â€œVery kind of you, Sandy,â€ said Hugh, and we walked on.

â€œWhat then?â€ I asked when the ponies had fallen behind again.

â€œWhy, superstition lingers here,â€ said Hugh, â€œand itâ€™s supposed sheâ€™s a
witch. To be quite candid with you, the thing interests me a good deal.
Supposing you asked me, on oath, whether I believed in witches, I should
say â€˜No.â€™ But if you asked me again, on oath, whether I suspected I
believed in them, I should, I think, say â€˜Yes.â€™ And the fifteenth of
this month--to-morrow--is Gavonâ€™s Eve.â€

â€œAnd what in Heavenâ€™s name is that?â€ I asked. â€œAnd who is Gavon? And
whatâ€™s the trouble?â€

â€œWell, Gavon is the person, I suppose, not saint, who is what we should
call the eponymous hero of this district. And the trouble is Sandyâ€™s
trouble. Rather a long story. But thereâ€™s a long mile in front of us
yet, if you care to be told.â€

During that mile I heard. Sandy had been engaged a year ago to a girl of
Gavon who was in service at Inverness. In March last he had gone,
without giving notice, to see her, and as he walked up the street in
which her mistressâ€™ house stood, had met her suddenly face to face, in
company with a man whose clipped speech betrayed him English, whose
manner a kind of gentleman. He had a flourish of his hat for Sandy,
pleasure to see him, and scarcely any need of explanation as to how he
came to be walking with Catrine. It was the most natural thing possible,
for a city like Inverness boasted its innocent urbanities, and a girl
could stroll with a man. And for the time, since also Catrine was so
frankly pleased to see him, Sandy was satisfied. But after his return to
Gavon, suspicion, fungus-like, grew rank in his mind, with the result
that a month ago he had, with infinite pains and blottings, written a
letter to Catrine, urging her return and immediate marriage. Thereafter
it was known that she had left Inverness; it was known that she had
arrived by train at Brora. From Brora she had started to walk across the
moor by the path leading just above the Pictsâ€™ Castle, crossing the
rapids to Gavon, leaving her box to be sent by the carrier. But at Gavon
she had never arrived. Also it was said that, though it was a hot
afternoon, she wore a big cloak.

By this time we had come to the lodge, the lights of which showed dim
and blurred through the thick hill-mists that had streamed sullenly down
from the higher ground.

â€œAnd the rest,â€ said Hugh, â€œwhich is as fantastic as this is sober fact,
I will tell you later.â€

Now, a fruit-bearing determination to go to bed is, to my mind, as
difficult to ripen as a fruit-bearing determination to get up, and in
spite of our long day, I was glad when Hugh (the rest of the men having
yawned themselves out of the smoking-room) came back from the hospitable
dispensing of bedroom candlesticks with a briskness that denoted that,
as far as he was concerned, the distressing determination was not
imminent.

â€œAs regards Sandy,â€ I suggested.

â€œAh, I also was thinking of that,â€ he said. â€œWell, Catrine Gordon left
Brora, and never arrived here. That is fact. Now for what remains. Have
you any remembrance of a woman always alone walking about the moor by
the loch? I think I once called your attention to her.â€

â€œYes, I remember,â€ I said. â€œNot Catrine, surely; a very old woman, awful
to look at. Moustache, whiskers, and muttering to herself. Always
looking at the ground, too.â€

â€œYes, that is she--not Catrine. Catrine! My word, a May morning! But the
other--it is Mrs Macpherson, reputed witch. Well, Sandy trudges there, a
mile and more away, every night to see her. You know Sandy: Adonis of
the north. Now, can you account by any natural explanation for that
fact? That he goes off after a long day to see an old hag in the hills?â€

â€œIt would seem unlikely,â€ said I.

â€œUnlikely! Well, yes, unlikely.â€

Hugh got up from his chair and crossed the room to where a bookcase of
rather fusty-looking volumes stood between windows. He took a small
morocco-backed book from a top shelf.

â€œSuperstitions of Sutherlandshire,â€ he said, as he handed it to me.
â€œTurn to page 128, and read.â€

I obeyed, and read.

â€œSeptember 15 appears to have been the date of what we may call this
devil festival. On the night of that day the powers of darkness held
pre-eminent dominion, and over-rode for any who were abroad that night
and invoked their aid, the protective Providence of Almighty God.
Witches, therefore, above all, were peculiarly potent. On this night any
witch could entice to herself the heart and the love of any young man
who consulted her on matters of philtre or love charm, with the result
that on any night in succeeding years of the same date, he, though he
was lawfully affianced and wedded, would for that night be hers. If,
however, he should call on the name of God through any sudden grace of
the Spirit, her charm would be of no avail. On this night, too, all
witches had the power by certain dreadful incantations and indescribable
profanities, to raise from the dead those who had committed suicide.â€

â€œTop of the next page,â€ said Hugh. â€œLeave out this next paragraph; it
does not bear on this last.â€

â€œNear a small village in this country,â€ I read, â€œcalled Gavon, the moon
at midnight is said to shine through a certain gap or fissure in a wall
of rock close beside the river on to the ruins of a Pict castle, so
that the light of its beams falls on to a large flat stone erected there
near the gate, and supposed by some to be an ancient and pagan altar. At
that moment, so the superstition still lingers in the country side, the
evil and malignant spirits which hold sway on Gavonâ€™s Eve, are at the
zenith of their powers, and those who invoke their aid at this moment
and in this place, will, though with infinite peril to their immortal
souls, get all that they desire of them.â€

The paragraph on the subject ended here, and I shut the book.

â€œWell?â€ I asked.

â€œUnder favourable circumstances two and two make four,â€ said Hugh.

â€œAnd four means----â€

â€œThis. Sandy is certainly in consultation with a woman who is supposed
to be a witch, whose path no crofter will cross after nightfall. He
wants to learn, at whatever cost, poor devil, what happened to Catrine.
Thus I think it more than possible that to-morrow, at midnight, there
will be folk by the Pictsâ€™ pool. There is another curious thing. I was
fishing there yesterday, and just opposite the river gate of the castle,
someone has set up a great flat stone, which has been dragged (for I
noticed the crushed grass) from the dÃ©bris at the bottom of the slope.â€

â€œYou mean that the old hag is going to try to raise the body of Catrine,
if she is dead?â€

â€œYes, and I mean to see myself what happens. Come too.â€

The next day Hugh and I fished down the river from the lodge, taking
with us not Sandy, but another gillie, and ate our lunch on the slope of
the Pictsâ€™ Castle after landing a couple of fish there. Even as Hugh had
said, a great flat slab of stone had been dragged on to the platform
outside the river gate of the castle, where it rested on certain rude
supports, which, now that it was in place, seemed certainly designed to
receive it. It was also exactly opposite that lancet window in the
basaltic rock across the pool, so that if the moon at midnight did shine
through it, the light would fall on the stone. This then was the almost
certain scene of the incantations.

Below the platform, as I have said, the ground fell rapidly away to the
level of the pool, which owing to rain on the hills was running very
high, and, streaked with lines of greyish bubbles, poured down in
amazing and ear-filling volume. But directly underneath the steep
escarpment of rock on the far side of the pool it lay foamless and
black, a still backwater of great depth. Above the altar-like erection
again the ground rose up seven rough-hewn steps to the gate itself, on
each side of which, to the height of about four feet, ran the circular
wall of the castle. Inside again were the remains of partition walls
between the three chambers, and it was in the one nearest to the river
gate that we determined to conceal ourselves that night. From there,
should the witch and Sandy keep tryst at the altar, any sound of
movement would reach us, and through the aperture of the gate itself we
could see, concealed in the shadow of the wall, whatever took place at
the altar or down below at the pool. The lodge, finally, was but a short
ten minutes away, if one went in the direct line, so that by starting at
a quarter to twelve that night, we could enter the Pictsâ€™ Castle by the
gate away from the river, thus not betraying our presence to those who
might be waiting for the moment when the moon should shine through the
lancet window in the wall of rock on to the altar in front of the river
gate.

Night fell very still and windless, and when not long before midnight we
let ourselves silently out of the lodge, though to the east the sky was
clear, a black continent of cloud was creeping up from the west, and had
now nearly reached the zenith. Out of the remote fringes of it
occasional lightning winked, and the growl of very distant thunder
sounded drowsily at long intervals after. But it seemed to me as if
another storm hung over our heads, ready every moment to burst, for the
oppression in the air was of a far heavier quality than so distant a
disturbance could have accounted for. To the east, however, the sky was
still luminously clear; the curiously hard edges of the western cloud
were star-embroidered, and by the dove-coloured light in the east it was
evident that the moonrise over the moor was imminent. And though I did
not in my heart believe that our expedition would end in anything but
yawns, I was conscious of an extreme tension and rawness of nerves,
which I set down to the thunder-charged air.

For noiselessness of footstep we had both put on india-rubber soled
shoes, and all the way down to the pool we heard nothing but the distant
thunder and our own padded tread. Very silently and cautiously we
ascended the steps of the gate away from the river, and keeping close to
the wall inside, sidled round to the river gate and peered out. For the
first moment I could see nothing, so black lay the shadow of the
rock-wall opposite across the pool, but by degrees I made out the lumps
and line of the glimmering foam which streaked the water. High as the
river was running this morning it was infinitely more voluminous and
turbulent now, and the sound of it filled and bewildered the ear with
its sonorous roaring. Only under the very base of the rock opposite it
ran quite black and unflecked by foam: there lay the deep still surface
of the backwater. Then suddenly I saw something black move in the
dimness in front of me, and against the grey foam rose up first the
head, then the shoulders, and finally the whole figure of a woman
coming towards us up the bank. Behind her walked another, a man, and the
two came to where the altar of stone had been newly erected and stood
there side by side silhouetted against the churned white of the stream.
Hugh had seen too, and touched me on the arm to call my attention. So
far then he was right: there was no mistaking the stalwart proportions
of Sandy.

Suddenly across the gloom shot a tiny spear of light, and momentarily as
we watched, it grew larger and longer, till a tall beam, as from some
window cut in the rock opposite, was shed on the bank below us. It moved
slowly, imperceptibly to the left till it struck full between the two
black figures standing there, and shone with a curious bluish gleam on
the flat stone in front of them. Then the roar of the river was suddenly
overscored by a dreadful screaming voice, the voice of a woman, and from
her side her arms shot up and out as if in invocation of some power. At
first I could catch none of the words, but soon from repetition they
began to convey an intelligible message to my brain, and I was listening
as in the paralytic horror of nightmare to a bellowing of the most
hideous and un-nameable profanity. What I heard I cannot bring myself to
record; suffice it to say that Satan was invoked by every adoring and
reverent name, that cursing and unspeakable malediction was poured forth
on Him whom we hold most holy. Then the yelling voice ceased as
suddenly as it had begun, and for a moment there was silence again, but
for the reverberating river.

Then once more that horror of sound was uplifted.

â€œSo, Catrine Gordon,â€ it cried, â€œI bid ye in the name of my master and
yourâ€™s to rise from where ye lie. Up with ye--up!â€

Once more there was silence; then I heard Hugh at my elbow draw a quick
sobbing breath, and his finger pointed unsteadily to the dead black
water below the rock. And I too looked and saw.

Right under the rock there appeared a pale subaqueous light, which waved
and quivered in the stream. At first it was very small and dim, but as
we looked it seemed to swim upwards from remote depths and grew larger
till I suppose the space of some square yard was illuminated by it. Then
the surface of the water was broken, and a head, the head of a girl,
dead-white and with long, flowing hair, appeared above the stream. Her
eyes were shut, the corners of her mouth drooped as in sleep, and the
moving water stood in a frill round her neck. Higher and higher rose the
figure out of the tide, till at last it stood, luminous in itself, so it
appeared, up to the middle. The head was bent down over the breast, and
the hands clasped together. As it emerged from the water it seemed to
get nearer, and was by now half-way across the pool, moving quietly and
steadily against the great flood of the hurrying river.

Then I heard a manâ€™s voice crying out in a sort of strangled agony.

â€œCatrine!â€ it cried; â€œCatrine! In Godâ€™s name; in Godâ€™s name!â€

In two strides Sandy had rushed down the steep bank, and hurled himself
out into that mad swirl of waters. For one moment I saw his arms flung
up into the sky, the next he had altogether gone. And on the utterance
of that name the unholy vision had vanished too, while simultaneously
there burst in front of us a light so blinding, followed by a crack of
thunder so appalling to the senses, that I know I just hid my face in my
hands. At once, as if the flood-gates of the sky had been opened, the
deluge was on us, not like rain, but like one sheet of solid water, so
that we cowered under it. Any hope or attempt to rescue Sandy was out of
the question; to dive into that whirlpool of mad water meant instant
death, and even had it been possible for any swimmer to live there, in
the blackness of the night there was absolutely no chance of finding
him. Besides, even if it had been possible to save him, I doubt whether
I was sufficiently master of my flesh and blood as to endure to plunge
where that apparition had risen.

Then, as we lay there, another horror filled and possessed my mind.
Somewhere close to us in the darkness was that woman whose yelling voice
just now had made my blood run ice-cold, while it brought the streaming
sweat to my forehead. At that moment I turned to Hugh.

â€œI cannot stop here,â€ I said. â€œI must run, run right away. Where is
She?â€

â€œDid you not see?â€ he asked.

â€œNo. What happened?â€

â€œThe lightning struck the stone within a few inches of where she was
standing. We--we must go and look for her.â€

I followed him down the slope, shaking as if I had the palsy, and
groping with my hands on the ground in front of me, in deadly terror of
encountering something human. The thunder-clouds had in the last few
minutes spread over the moon, so that no ray from the window in the rock
guided our search. But up and down the bank from the stone that lay
shattered there to the edge of the pool we groped and stumbled, but
found nothing. At length we gave it up: it seemed morally certain that
she, too, had rolled down the bank after the lightning stroke, and lay
somewhere deep in the pool from which she had called the dead.

None fished the pool next day, but men with drag-nets came from Brora.
Right under the rock in the backwater lay two bodies, close together,
Sandy and the dead girl. Of the other they found nothing.

       *       *       *       *       *

It would seem, then, that Catrine Gordon, in answer to Sandyâ€™s letter,
left Inverness in heavy trouble. What happened afterwards can only be
conjectured, but it seems likely she took the short cut to Gavon,
meaning to cross the river on the boulders above the Pictsâ€™ pool. But
whether she slipped accidentally in her passage, and so was drawn down
by the hungry water, or whether, unable to face the future, she had
thrown herself into the pool, we can only guess. In any case they sleep
together now in the bleak, wind-swept graveyard at Brora, in obedience
to the inscrutable designs of God.




THE CONFESSION OF CHARLES LINKWORTH


Dr Teesdale had occasion to attend the condemned man once or twice
during the week before his execution, and found him, as is often the
case, when his last hope of life has vanished, quiet and perfectly
resigned to his fate, and not seeming to look forward with any dread to
the morning that each hour that passed brought nearer and nearer. The
bitterness of death appeared to be over for him: it was done with when
he was told that his appeal was refused. But for those days while hope
was not yet quite abandoned, the wretched man had drank of death daily.
In all his experience the doctor had never seen a man so wildly and
passionately tenacious of life, nor one so strongly knit to this
material world by the sheer animal lust of living. Then the news that
hope could no longer be entertained was told him, and his spirit passed
out of the grip of that agony of torture and suspense, and accepted the
inevitable with indifference. Yet the change was so extraordinary that
it seemed to the doctor rather that the news had completely stunned his
powers of feeling, and he was below the numbed surface, still knit into
material things as strongly as ever. He had fainted when the result was
told him, and Dr Teesdale had been called in to attend him. But the fit
was but transient, and he came out of it into full consciousness of what
had happened.

The murder had been a deed of peculiar horror, and there was nothing of
sympathy in the mind of the public towards the perpetrator. Charles
Linkworth, who now lay under capital sentence, was the keeper of a small
stationery store in Sheffield, and there lived with him his wife and
mother. The latter was the victim of his atrocious crime; the motive of
it being to get possession of the sum of five hundred pounds, which was
this womanâ€™s property. Linkworth, as came out at the trial, was in debt
to the extent of a hundred pounds at the time, and during his wifeâ€™s
absence from home, on a visit to relations, he strangled his mother, and
during the night buried the body in the small back-garden of his house.
On his wifeâ€™s return, he had a sufficiently plausible tale to account
for the elder Mrs Linkworthâ€™s disappearance, for there had been constant
jarrings and bickerings between him and his mother for the last year or
two, and she had more than once threatened to withdraw herself and the
eight shillings a week which she contributed to household expenses, and
purchase an annuity with her money. It was true, also, that during the
younger Mrs Linkworthâ€™s absence from home, mother and son had had a
violent quarrel arising originally from some trivial point in household
management, and that in consequence of this, she had actually drawn her
money out of the bank, intending to leave Sheffield next day and settle
in London where she had friends. That evening she told him this, and
during the night he killed her.

His next step, before his wifeâ€™s return, was logical and sound. He
packed up all his motherâ€™s possessions and took them to the station,
from which he saw them despatched to town by passenger train, and in the
evening he asked several friends in to supper, and told them of his
motherâ€™s departure. He did not (logically also, and in accordance with
what they probably already knew) feign regret, but said that he and she
had never got on well together, and that the cause of peace and
quietness was furthered by her going. He told the same story to his wife
on her return, identical in every detail, adding, however, that the
quarrel had been a violent one, and that his mother had not even left
him her address. This again was wisely thought of: it would prevent his
wife from writing to her. She appeared to accept his story completely:
indeed there was nothing strange or suspicious about it.

For a while he behaved with the composure and astuteness which most
criminals possess up to a certain point, the lack of which, after that,
is generally the cause of their detection. He did not, for instance,
immediately pay off his debts, but took into his house a young man as
lodger, who occupied his motherâ€™s room, and he dismissed the assistant
in his shop, and did the entire serving himself. This gave the
impression of economy, and at the same time he openly spoke of the great
improvement in his trade, and not till a month had passed did he cash
any of the bank-notes which he had found in a locked drawer in his
motherâ€™s room. Then he changed two notes of fifty pounds and paid off
his creditors.

At that point his astuteness and composure failed him. He opened a
deposit account at a local bank with four more fifty-pound notes,
instead of being patient, and increasing his balance at the savings bank
pound by pound, and he got uneasy about that which he had buried deep
enough for security in the back garden. Thinking to render himself safer
in this regard, he ordered a cartload of slag and stone fragments and
with the help of his lodger employed the summer evenings when work was
over, in building a sort of rockery over the spot. Then came the chance
circumstance which really set match to this dangerous train. There was a
fire in the lost luggage office at Kingâ€™s Cross Station (from which he
ought to have claimed his motherâ€™s property) and one of the two boxes
was partially burned. The company was liable for compensation, and his
motherâ€™s name on her linen, and a letter with the Sheffield address on
it, led to the arrival of a purely official and formal notice, stating
that the company were prepared to consider claims. It was directed to
Mrs Linkworth, and Charles Linkworthâ€™s wife received and read it.

It seemed a sufficiently harmless document, but it was endorsed with his
death-warrant. For he could give no explanation at all of the fact of
the boxes still lying at Kingâ€™s Cross Station, beyond suggesting that
some accident had happened to his mother. Clearly he had to put the
matter in the hands of the police, with a view to tracing her movements,
and if it proved that she was dead, claiming her property, which she had
already drawn out of the bank. Such at least was the course urged on him
by his wife and lodger, in whose presence the communication from the
railway officials was read out, and it was impossible to refuse to take
it. Then the silent, uncreaking machinery of justice, characteristic of
England, began to move forward. Quiet men lounged about Smith Street,
visited banks, observed the supposed increase in trade, and from a house
near by looked into the garden where ferns were already flourishing on
the rockery. Then came the arrest and the trial, which did not last very
long, and on a certain Saturday night the verdict. Smart women in large
hats had made the court bright with colour, and in all the crowd there
was not one who felt any sympathy with the young athletic-looking man
who was condemned. Many of the audience were elderly and respectable
mothers, and the crime had been an outrage on motherhood, and they
listened to the unfolding of the flawless evidence with strong approval.
They thrilled a little when the judge put on the awful and ludicrous
little black cap, and spoke the sentence appointed by God.

Linkworth went to pay the penalty for the atrocious deed, which no one
who had heard the evidence could possibly doubt that he had done, with
the same indifference as had marked his entire demeanour since he knew
his appeal had failed. The prison chaplain who had attended him had done
his utmost to get him to confess, but his efforts had been quite
ineffectual, and to the last he asserted, though without protestation,
his innocence. On a bright September morning, when the sun shone warm on
the terrible little procession that crossed the prison yard to the shed
where was erected the apparatus of death, justice was done, and Dr
Teesdale was satisfied that life was immediately extinct. He had been
present on the scaffold, had watched the bolt drawn, and the hooded and
pinioned figure drop into the pit. He had heard the chunk and creak of
the rope as the sudden weight came on to it, and looking down he had
seen the queer twitchings of the hanged body. They had lasted but a
second or two; the execution had been perfectly satisfactory.

An hour later he made the post-mortem examination, and found that his
view had been correct: the vertebrae of the spine had been broken at the
neck, and death must have been absolutely instantaneous. It was hardly
necessary even to make that little piece of dissection that proved this,
but for the sake of form he did so. And at that moment he had a very
curious and vivid mental impression that the spirit of the dead man was
close beside him, as if it still dwelt in the broken habitation of its
body. But there was no question at all that the body was dead: it had
been dead an hour. Then followed another little circumstance that at the
first seemed insignificant though curious also. One of the warders
entered, and asked if the rope which had been used an hour ago, and was
the hangmanâ€™s perquisite, had by mistake been brought into the mortuary
with the body. But there was no trace of it, and it seemed to have
vanished altogether though it was a singular thing to be lost: it was
not here; it was not on the scaffold. And though the disappearance was
of no particular moment, it was quite inexplicable.

Dr Teesdale was a bachelor and a man of independent means, and lived in
a tall-windowed and commodious house in Bedford Square, where a plain
cook of surpassing excellence looked after his food, and her husband his
person. There was no need for him to practise a profession at all, and
he performed his work at the prison for the sake of the study of the
minds of criminals. Most crime--the transgression, that is, of the rule
of conduct which the human race has framed for the sake of its own
preservation--he held to be either the result of some abnormality of the
brain, or of starvation. Crimes of theft, for instance, he would by no
means refer to one head; often it is true they were the result of actual
want, but more often dictated by some obscure disease of the brain. In
marked cases it was labelled as kleptomania, but he was convinced there
were many others which did not fall directly under the dictation of
physical need. More especially was this the case where the crime in
question involved also some deed of violence, and he mentally placed
underneath this heading, as he went home that evening, the criminal at
whose last moments he had been present that morning. The crime had been
abominable, the need of money not so very pressing, and the very
abomination and unnaturalness of the murder inclined him to consider the
murderer as lunatic rather than criminal. He had been, as far as was
known, a man of quiet and kindly disposition, a good husband, a sociable
neighbour. And then he had committed a crime, just one, which put him
outside all pales. So monstrous a deed, whether perpetrated by a sane
man or a mad one, was intolerable; there was no use for the doer of it
on this planet at all. But somehow the doctor felt that he would have
been more at one with the execution of justice, if the dead man had
confessed. It was morally certain that he was guilty, but he wished that
when there was no longer any hope for him, he had endorsed the verdict
himself.

He dined alone that evening, and after dinner sat in his study which
adjoined the dining-room, and feeling disinclined to read, sat in his
great red chair opposite the fireplace, and let his mind graze where it
would. At once almost, it went back to the curious sensation he had
experienced that morning, of feeling that the spirit of Linkworth was
present in the mortuary, though life had been extinct for an hour. It
was not the first time, especially in cases of sudden death, that he had
felt a similar conviction, though perhaps it had never been quite so
unmistakable as it had been to-day. Yet the feeling, to his mind, was
quite probably formed on a natural and psychical truth. The spirit--it
may be remarked that he was a believer in the doctrine of future life,
and the non-extinction of the soul with the death of the body--was very
likely unable or unwilling to quit at once and altogether the earthly
habitation, very likely it lingered there, earth-bound, for a while. In
his leisure hours Dr Teesdale was a considerable student of the occult,
for like most advanced and proficient physicians, he clearly recognised
how narrow was the boundary of separation between soul and body, how
tremendous the influence of the intangible was over material things,
and it presented no difficulty to his mind that a disembodied spirit
should be able to communicate directly with those who still were bounded
by the finite and material.

His meditations, which were beginning to group themselves into definite
sequence, were interrupted at this moment. On his desk near at hand
stood his telephone, and the bell rang, not with its usual metallic
insistence, but very faintly, as if the current was weak, or the
mechanism impaired. However, it certainly was ringing, and he got up and
took the combined ear and mouth-piece off its hook.

â€œYes, yes,â€ he said, â€œwho is it?â€

There was a whisper in reply almost inaudible, and quite unintelligible.

â€œI canâ€™t hear you,â€ he said.

Again the whisper sounded, but with no greater distinctness. Then it
ceased altogether.

He stood there, for some half minute or so, waiting for it to be
renewed, but beyond the usual chuckling and croaking, which showed,
however, that he was in communication with some other instrument, there
was silence. Then he replaced the receiver, rang up the Exchange, and
gave his number.

â€œCan you tell me what number rang me up just now?â€ he asked.

There was a short pause, then it was given him. It was the number of the
prison, where he was doctor.

â€œPut me on to it, please,â€ he said.

This was done.

â€œYou rang me up just now,â€ he said down the tube. â€œYes; I am Doctor
Teesdale. What is it? I could not hear what you said.â€

The voice came back quite clear and intelligible.

â€œSome mistake, sir,â€ it said, â€œWe havenâ€™t rang you up.â€

â€œBut the exchange tells me you did, three minutes ago.â€

â€œMistake at the Exchange, sir,â€ said the voice.

â€œVery odd. Well, good-night. Warder Draycott, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œYes, sir; good-night, sir.â€

Dr Teesdale went back to his big arm-chair, still less inclined to read.
He let his thoughts wander on for a while, without giving them definite
direction, but ever and again his mind kept coming back to that strange
little incident of the telephone. Often and often he had been rung up by
some mistake, often and often he had been put on to the wrong number by
the exchange, but there was something in this very subdued ringing of
the telephone bell, and the unintelligible whisperings at the other end
that suggested a very curious train of reflection to his mind, and soon
he found himself pacing up and down his room, with his thoughts eagerly
feeding on a most unusual pasture.

â€œBut itâ€™s impossible,â€ he said, aloud.

He went down as usual to the prison next morning and once again he was
strangely beset with the feeling that there was some unseen presence
there. He had before now had some odd psychical experiences, and knew
that he was a â€œsensitiveâ€--one, that is, who is capable, under certain
circumstances, of receiving supernormal impressions, and of having
glimpses of the unseen world that lies about us. And this morning the
presence of which he was conscious was that of the man who had been
executed yesterday morning. It was local, and he felt it most strongly
in the little prison yard, and as he passed the door of the condemned
cell. So strong was it there that he would not have been surprised if
the figure of the man had been visible to him, and as he passed through
the door at the end of the passage, he turned round, actually expecting
to see it. All the time, too, he was aware of a profound horror at his
heart, this unseen presence strangely disturbed him. And the poor soul,
he felt, wanted something done for it. Not for a moment did he doubt
that this impression of his was objective, it was no imaginative phantom
of his own invention that made itself so real. The spirit of Linkworth
was there.

He passed into the infirmary, and for a couple of hours busied himself
with his work. But all the time he was aware that the same invisible
presence was near him, though its force was manifestly less here than in
those places which had been more intimately associated with the man.
Finally, before he left, in order to test his theory he looked into the
execution shed. But next moment with a face suddenly stricken pale, he
came out again, closing the door hastily. At the top of the steps stood
a figure hooded and pinioned, but hazy of outline and only faintly
visible. But it was visible, there was no mistake about it.

Dr Teesdale was a man of good nerve, and he recovered himself almost
immediately, ashamed of his temporary panic. The terror that had
blanched his face was chiefly the effect of startled nerves, not of
terrified heart, and yet deeply interested as he was in psychical
phenomena, he could not command himself sufficiently to go back there.
Or rather he commanded himself, but his muscles refused to act on the
message. If this poor earth-bound spirit had any communication to make
to him, he certainly much preferred that it should be made at a
distance. As far as he could understand, its range was circumscribed. It
haunted the prison yard, the condemned cell, the execution shed, it was
more faintly felt in the infirmary. Then a further point suggested
itself to his mind, and he went back to his room and sent for Warder
Draycott, who had answered him on the telephone last night.

â€œYou are quite sure,â€ he asked, â€œthat nobody rang me up last night, just
before I rang you up?â€

There was a certain hesitation in the manâ€™s manner which the doctor
noticed.

â€œI donâ€™t see how it could be possible, sir,â€ he said, â€œI had been
sitting close by the telephone for half an hour before, and again before
that. I must have seen him, if anyone had been to the instrument.â€

â€œAnd you _saw_ no one?â€ said the doctor with a slight emphasis.

The man became more markedly ill at ease.

â€œNo, sir, I _saw_ no one,â€ he said, with the same emphasis.

Dr Teesdale looked away from him.

â€œBut you had perhaps the impression that there was some one there?â€ he
asked, carelessly, as if it was a point of no interest.

Clearly Warder Draycott had something on his mind, which he found it
hard to speak of.

â€œWell, sir, if you put it like that,â€ he began. â€œBut you would tell me I
was half asleep, or had eaten something that disagreed with me at my
supper.â€

The doctor dropped his careless manner.

â€œI should do nothing of the kind,â€ he said, â€œany more than you would
tell me that I had dropped asleep last night, when I heard my telephone
bell ring. Mind you, Draycott, it did not ring as usual, I could only
just hear it ringing, though it was close to me. And I could only hear a
whisper when I put my ear to it. But when you spoke I heard you quite
distinctly. Now I believe there was something--somebody--at this end of
the telephone. You were here, and though you saw no one, you, too, felt
there was someone there.â€

The man nodded.

â€œIâ€™m not a nervous man, sir,â€ he said, â€œand I donâ€™t deal in fancies. But
there was something there. It was hovering about the instrument, and it
wasnâ€™t the wind, because there wasnâ€™t a breath of wind stirring, and the
night was warm. And I shut the window to make certain. But it went about
the room, sir, for an hour or more. It rustled the leaves of the
telephone book, and it ruffled my hair when it came close to me. And it
was bitter cold, sir.â€

The doctor looked him straight in the face.

â€œDid it remind you of what had been done yesterday morning?â€ he asked
suddenly.

Again the man hesitated.

â€œYes, sir,â€ he said at length. â€œConvict Charles Linkworth.â€

Dr Teesdale nodded reassuringly.

â€œThatâ€™s it,â€ he said. â€œNow, are you on duty to-night?â€

â€œYes, sir, I wish I wasnâ€™t.â€

â€œI know how you feel, I have felt exactly the same myself. Now whatever
this is, it seems to want to communicate with me. By the way, did you
have any disturbance in the prison last night?â€

â€œYes, sir, there was half a dozen men who had the nightmare. Yelling
and screaming they were, and quiet men too, usually. It happens
sometimes the night after an execution. Iâ€™ve known it before, though
nothing like what it was last night.â€

â€œI see. Now, if this--this thing you canâ€™t see wants to get at the
telephone again to-night, give it every chance. It will probably come
about the same time. I canâ€™t tell you why, but that usually happens. So
unless you must, donâ€™t be in this room where the telephone is, just for
an hour to give it plenty of time between half past nine and half past
ten. I will be ready for it at the other end. Supposing I am rung up, I
will, when it has finished, ring you up to make sure that I was not
being called in--in the usual way.

â€œAnd there is nothing to be afraid of, sir?â€ asked the man.

Dr Teesdale remembered his own moment of terror this morning, but he
spoke quite sincerely.

â€œI am sure there is nothing to be afraid of,â€ he said, reassuringly.

Dr Teesdale had a dinner engagement that night, which he broke, and was
sitting alone in his study by half past nine. In the present state of
human ignorance as to the law which governs the movements of spirits
severed from the body, he could not tell the warder why it was that
their visits are so often periodic, timed to punctuality according to
our scheme of hours, but in scenes of tabulated instances of the
appearance of _revenants_, especially if the soul was in sore need of
help, as might be the case here, he found that they came at the same
hour of day or night. As a rule, too, their power of making themselves
seen or heard or felt, grew greater for some little while after death,
subsequently growing weaker as they became less earth-bound, or often
after that ceasing altogether, and he was prepared to-night for a less
indistinct impression. The spirit apparently for the early hours of its
disembodiment is weak, like a moth newly broken out from its
chrysalis--and then suddenly the telephone bell rang, not so faintly as
the night before, but still not with its ordinary imperative tone.

Dr Teesdale instantly got up, put the receiver to his ears. And what he
heard was heart-broken sobbing, strong spasms that seemed to tear the
weeper.

He waited for a little before speaking, himself cold with some nameless
fear, and yet profoundly moved to help, if he was able.

â€œYes, yes,â€ he said at length, hearing his own voice tremble. â€œI am Dr
Teesdale. What can I do for you? And who are you?â€ he added, though he
felt that it was a needless question.

Slowly the sobbing died down, the whispers took its place, still broken
by crying.

â€œI want to tell, sir--I want to tell--I must tell.â€

â€œYes, tell me, what is it?â€ said the doctor.

â€œNo, not you--another gentleman, who used to come to see me. Will you
speak to him what I say to you?--I canâ€™t make him hear me or see me.â€

â€œWho are you?â€ asked Dr Teesdale suddenly.

â€œCharles Linkworth. I thought you knew. I am very miserable. I canâ€™t
leave the prison--and it is cold. Will you send for the other
gentleman?â€

â€œDo you mean the chaplain?â€ asked Dr Teesdale.

â€œYes, the chaplain. He read the service when I went across the yard
yesterday. I shanâ€™t be so miserable when I have told.â€

The doctor hesitated a moment. This was a strange story that he would
have to tell Mr Dawkins, the prison chaplain, that at the other end of
the telephone was the spirit of the man executed yesterday. And yet he
soberly believed that it was so that this unhappy spirit was in misery,
and wanted to â€œtell.â€ There was no need to ask what he wanted to tell.

â€œYes, I will ask him to come here,â€ he said at length.

â€œThank you, sir, a thousand times. You will make him come, wonâ€™t you?â€

The voice was growing fainter.

â€œIt must be to-morrow night,â€ it said. â€œI canâ€™t speak longer now. I have
to go to see--oh, my God, my God.â€

The sobs broke out afresh, sounding fainter and fainter. But it was in a
frenzy of terrified interest that Dr Teesdale spoke.

â€œTo see what?â€ he cried â€œTell me what you are doing, what is happening
to you?â€

â€œI canâ€™t tell you; I maynâ€™t tell you,â€ said the voice very faint. â€œThat
is part----â€ and it died away altogether.

Dr Teesdale waited a little, but there was no further sound of any kind,
except the chuckling and croaking of the instrument. He put the receiver
on to its hook again, and then became aware for the first time that his
forehead was streaming with some, cold dew of horror. His ears sang; his
heart beat very quick and faint, and he sat down to recover himself.
Once or twice he asked himself if it was possible that some terrible
joke was being played on him, but he knew that could not be so; he felt
perfectly sure that he had been speaking with a soul in torment of
contrition for the terrible and irremediable act it had committed. It
was no delusion of his senses, either; here in this comfortable room of
his in Bedford Square, with London cheerfully roaring round him, he had
spoken with the spirit of Charles Linkworth.

But he had no time (nor indeed inclination, for somehow his soul sat
shuddering within him) to indulge in meditation. First of all he rang up
the prison.

â€œWarder Draycott?â€ he asked.

There was a perceptible tremor in the manâ€™s voice as he answered.

â€œYes, sir. Is it Dr Teesdale?â€

â€œYes. Has anything happened here with you?â€

Twice it seemed that the man tried to speak and could not. At the third
attempt the words came.

â€œYes, sir. He has been here. I saw him go into the room where the
telephone is.â€

â€œAh! Did you speak to him?â€

â€œNo, sir: I sweated and prayed. And thereâ€™s half a dozen men as have
been screaming in their sleep to-night. But itâ€™s quiet again now. I
think he has gone into the execution shed.â€

â€œYes. Well, I think there will be no more disturbance now. By the way,
please give me Mr Dawkinsâ€™s home address.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

This was given him, and Dr Teesdale proceeded to write to the chaplain,
asking him to dine with him on the following night. But suddenly he
found that he could not write at his accustomed desk, with the telephone
standing close to him, and he went upstairs to the drawing-room which he
seldom used, except when he entertained his friends. There he recaptured
the serenity of his nerves, and could control his hand. The note simply
asked Mr Dawkins to dine with him next night, when he wished to tell him
a very strange history and ask his help. â€œEven if you have any other
engagement,â€ he concluded, â€œI seriously request you to give it up.
To-night, I did the same. I should bitterly have regretted it if I had
not.â€

Next night accordingly, the two sat at their dinner in the doctorâ€™s
dining-room, and when they were left to their cigarettes and coffee the
doctor spoke.

â€œYou must not think me mad, my dear Dawkins,â€ he said, â€œwhen you hear
what I have got to tell you.â€

Mr Dawkins laughed.

â€œI will certainly promise not to do that,â€ he said.

â€œGood. Last night and the night before, a little later in the evening
than this, I spoke through the telephone with the spirit of the man we
saw executed two days ago. Charles Linkworth.â€

The chaplain did not laugh. He pushed back his chair, looking annoyed.

â€œTeesdale,â€ he said, â€œis it to tell me this--I donâ€™t want to be
rude--but this bogey-tale that you have brought me here his evening?â€

â€œYes. You have not heard half of it. He asked me last night to get hold
of you. He wants to tell you something. We can guess, I think, what it
is.â€

Dawkins got up.

â€œPlease let me hear no more of it,â€ he said. â€œThe dead do not return. In
what state or under what condition they exist has not been revealed to
us. But they have done with all material things.â€

â€œBut I must tell you more,â€ said the doctor. â€œTwo nights ago I was rung
up, but very faintly, and could hear only whispers. I instantly inquired
where the call came from and was told it came from the prison. I rang
up the prison, and Warder Draycott told me that nobody had rung me up.
He, too, was conscious of a presence.â€

â€œI think that man drinks,â€ said Dawkins, sharply.

The doctor paused a moment.

â€œMy dear fellow, you should not say that sort of thing,â€ he said. â€œHe is
one of the steadiest men we have got. And if he drinks, why not I also?â€

The chaplain sat down again.

â€œYou must forgive me,â€ he said, â€œbut I canâ€™t go into this. These are
dangerous matters to meddle with. Besides, how do you know it is not a
hoax?â€

â€œPlayed by whom?â€ asked the doctor. â€œHark!â€

The telephone bell suddenly rang. It was clearly audible to the doctor.

â€œDonâ€™t you hear it?â€ he said.

â€œHear what?â€

â€œThe telephone bell ringing.â€

â€œI hear no bell,â€ said the chaplain, rather angrily. â€œThere is no bell
ringing.â€

The doctor did not answer, but went through into his study, and turned
on the lights. Then he took the receiver and mouthpiece off its hook.

â€œYes?â€ he said, in a voice that trembled. â€œWho is it? Yes: Mr Dawkins is
here. I will try and get him to speak to you.â€

He went back into the other room.

â€œDawkins,â€ he said, â€œthere is a soul in agony. I pray you to listen.
For Godâ€™s sake come and listen.â€

The chaplain hesitated a moment.

â€œAs you will,â€ he said.

He took up the receiver and put it to his ear.

â€œI am Mr Dawkins,â€ he said.

He waited.

â€œI can hear nothing whatever,â€ he said at length. â€œAh, there was
something there. The faintest whisper.â€

â€œAh, try to hear, try to hear!â€ said the doctor.

Again the chaplain listened. Suddenly he laid the instrument down,
frowning.

â€œSomething--somebody said, â€˜I killed her, I confess it. I want to be
forgiven.â€™ Itâ€™s a hoax, my dear Teesdale. Somebody knowing your
spiritualistic leanings is playing a very grim joke on you. I _canâ€™t_
believe it.â€

Dr Teesdale took up the receiver.

â€œI am Dr Teesdale,â€ he said. â€œCan you give Mr Dawkins some sign that it
is you?â€

Then he laid it down again.

â€œHe says he thinks he can,â€ he said. â€œWe must wait.â€

The evening was again very warm, and the window into the paved yard at
the back of the house was open. For five minutes or so the two men stood
in silence, waiting, and nothing happened. Then the chaplain spoke.

â€œI think that is sufficiently conclusive,â€ he said.

Even as he spoke a very cold draught of air suddenly blew into the room,
making the papers on the desk rustle. Dr Teesdale went to the window and
closed it.

â€œDid you feel that?â€ he asked.

â€œYes, a breath of air. Chilly.â€

Once again in the closed room it stirred again.

â€œAnd did you feel that?â€ asked the doctor.

The chaplain nodded. He felt his heart hammering in his throat suddenly.

â€œDefend us from all peril and danger of this coming night,â€ he
exclaimed.

â€œSomething is coming!â€ said the doctor.

As he spoke it came. In the centre of the room not three yards away from
them stood the figure of a man with his head bent over on to his
shoulder, so that the face was not visible. Then he took his head in
both his hands and raised it like a weight, and looked them in the face.
The eyes and tongue protruded, a livid mark was round the neck. Then
there came a sharp rattle on the boards of the floor, and the figure was
no longer there. But on the floor there lay a new rope.

For a long while neither spoke. The sweat poured off the doctorâ€™s face,
and the chaplainâ€™s white lips whispered prayers. Then by a huge effort
the doctor pulled himself together. He pointed at the rope.

â€œIt has been missing since the execution,â€ he said.

Then again the telephone bell rang. This time the chaplain needed no
prompting. He went to it at once and the ringing ceased. For a while he
listened in silence.

â€œCharles Linkworth,â€ he said at length, â€œin the sight of God, in whose
presence you stand, are you truly sorry for your sin?â€

Some answer inaudible to the doctor came, and the chaplain closed his
eyes. And Dr Teesdale knelt as he heard the words of the Absolution.

At the close there was silence again.

â€œI can hear nothing more,â€ said the chaplain, replacing the receiver.

Presently the doctorâ€™s man-servant came in with the tray of spirits and
syphon. Dr Teesdale pointed without looking to where the apparition had
been.

â€œTake the rope that is there and burn it, Parker,â€ he said.

There was a momentâ€™s silence.

â€œThere is no rope, sir,â€ said Parker.




AT ABDUL ALIâ€™S GRAVE


Luxor, as most of those who have been there will allow, is a place of
notable charm, and boasts many attractions for the traveller, chief
among which he will reckon an excellent hotel containing a
billiard-room, a garden fit for the gods to sit in, any quantity of
visitors, at least a weekly dance on board a tourist steamer, quail
shooting, a climate as of Avilion, and a number of stupendously ancient
monuments for those archÃ¦ologically inclined. But to certain others, few
indeed in number, but almost fanatically convinced of their own
orthodoxy, the charm of Luxor, like some sleeping beauty, only wakes
when these things cease, when the hotel has grown empty and the
billiard-marker â€œhas gone for a long restâ€ to Cairo, when the decimated
quail and the decimating tourist have fled northwards, and the Theban
plain, DanÃ¦ to a tropical sun, is a gridiron across which no man would
willingly make a journey by day, not even if Queen Hatasoo herself
should signify that she would give him audience on the terraces of
Deir-el-Bahari. A suspicion however that the fanatic few were right, for
in other respects they were men of estimable opinions, induced me to
examine their convictions for myself, and thus it came about that two
years ago, certain days toward the beginning of June saw me still there,
a confirmed convert.

Much tobacco and the length of summer days had assisted us to the
analysis of the charm of which summer in the south is possessed, and
Weston--one of the earliest of the elect--and myself had discussed it at
some length, and though we reserved as the principal ingredient a
nameless something which baffled the chemist, and must be felt to be
understood, we were easily able to detect certain other drugs of sight
and sound, which we were agreed, contributed to the whole. A few of them
are here subjoined.

The waking in the warm darkness just before dawn to find that the desire
for stopping in bed fails with the awakening.

The silent start across the Nile in the still air with our horses, who,
like us, stand and sniff at the incredible sweetness of the coming
morning without apparently finding it less wonderful in repetition.

The moment infinitesimal in duration but infinite in sensation, just
before the sun rises, when the grey shrouded river is struck suddenly
out of darkness, and becomes a sheet of green bronze.

The rose flush, rapid as a change of colour in some chemical
combination, which shoots across the sky from east to west, followed
immediately by the sunlight which catches the peaks of the western
hills, and flows down like some luminous liquid.

The stir and whisper which goes through the world: a breeze springs up;
a lark soars and sings; the boatman shouts â€œYallah. Yallahâ€; the horses
toss their heads.

The subsequent ride.

The subsequent breakfast on our return.

The subsequent absence of anything to do.

At sunset the ride into the desert thick with the scent of warm barren
sand, which smells like nothing else in the world, for it smells of
nothing at all.

The blaze of the tropical night.

Camelâ€™s milk.

Converse with the fellahin, who are the most charming and least
accountable people on the face of the earth except when tourists are
about, and when in consequence there is no thought but backsheesh.

Lastly, and with this we are concerned, the possibility of odd
experiences.

       *       *       *       *       *

The beginning of the things which make this tale occurred four days ago,
when Abdul Ali, the oldest man in the village, died suddenly, full of
days and riches. Both, some thought, had probably been somewhat
exaggerated, but his relations affirmed without variation that he had as
many years as he had English pounds, and that each was a hundred. The
apt roundness of these numbers was incontestable, the thing was too
neat not to be true, and before he had been dead for twenty-four hours,
it was a matter of orthodoxy. But with regard to his relations, that
which turned their bereavement, which must soon have occurred, into a
source of blank dismay instead of pious resignation, was that not one of
these English pounds, not even their less satisfactory equivalent in
notes, which, out of the tourist season, are looked upon at Luxor as a
not very dependable variety of Philosopherâ€™s stone, though certainly
capable of producing gold under favourable circumstances, could be
found. Abdul Ali with his hundred years was dead, his century of
sovereigns--they might as well have been an annuity--were dead with him,
and his son Mohamed, who had previously enjoyed a sort of brevet rank in
anticipation of the event, was considered to be throwing far more dust
in the air than the genuine affection even of a chief mourner wholly
justified.

Abdul, it is to be feared, was not a man of stereotyped respectability;
though full of years and riches, he enjoyed no great reputation for
honour. He drank wine whenever he could get it, he ate food during the
days of Ramadan, scornful of the fact, when his appetite desired it, he
was supposed to have the evil eye, and in his last moments he was
attended by the notorious Achmet, who is well known here to be practised
in Black Magic, and has been suspected of the much meaner crime of
robbing the bodies of those lately dead. For in Egypt, while to despoil
the bodies of ancient kings and priests is a privilege for which
advanced and learned societies vie with each other, to rob the corpses
of your contemporaries, is considered the deed of a dog. Mohamed who
soon exchanged the throwing of dust in the air for the more natural mode
of expressing chagrin, which is to gnaw the nails, told us in confidence
that he suspected Achmet of having ascertained the secret of where his
fatherâ€™s money was, but it appeared that Achmet had as blank a face as
anybody when his patient, who was striving to make some communication to
him, went out into the great silence, and the suspicion that he knew
where the money was, gave way, in the minds of those who were competent
to form an estimate of his character, to a but dubious regret that he
had just failed to learn that very important fact.

So Abdul died and was buried, and we all went to the funeral feast at
which we ate more roast meat than one naturally cares about at five in
the afternoon on a June day, in consequence of which Weston and I, not
requiring dinner, stopped at home after our return from the ride into
the desert, and talked to Mohamed, Abdulâ€™s son, and Hussein, Abdulâ€™s
youngest grandson, a boy of about twenty, who is also our valet, cook
and housemaid, and they together woefully narrated of the money that had
been and was not, and told us scandalous tales about Achmet concerning
his weakness for cemeteries. They drank coffee and smoked, for though
Hussein was our servant, we had been that day the guests of his father,
and shortly after they had gone, up came Machmout.

Machmout, who says he thinks he is twelve, but does not know for
certain, is kitchen-maid, groom and gardener, and has to an
extraordinary degree some occult power resembling clairvoyance. Weston,
who is a member of the Society for Psychical Research, and the tragedy
of whose life has been the detection of the fraudulent medium Mrs Blunt,
says that it is all thought-reading, and has made notes of many of
Machmoutâ€™s performances, which may subsequently turn out to be of
interest. Thought-reading, however, does not seem to me to fully explain
the experience which followed Abdulâ€™s funeral, and with Machmout I have
to put it down to White Magic, which should be a very inclusive term, or
to Pure Coincidence, which is even more inclusive, and will cover all
the inexplicable phenomena of the world, taken singly. Machmoutâ€™s method
of unloosing the forces of White Magic is simple, being the ink-mirror
known by name to many, and it is as follows.

A little black ink is poured into the palm of Machmoutâ€™s hand, or, as
ink has been at a premium lately owing to the last post-boat from Cairo
which contained stationery for us, having stuck on a sand-bank, a small
piece of black American cloth about an inch in diameter, is found to be
a perfect substitute. Upon this he gazes. After five or ten minutes his
shrewd monkey-like expression is struck from his face, his eyes, wide
open, remain fixed on the cloth, a complete rigidity sets in over his
muscles, and he tells us of the curious things he sees. In whatever
position he is, in that position he remains without the deflection of a
hairâ€™s breadth until the ink is washed off or the cloth removed. Then he
looks up and says, â€œKhalÃ¡s,â€ which means, â€œIt is finished.â€

We only engaged Machmoutâ€™s services as second general domestic a
fortnight ago, but the first evening he was with us he came upstairs
when he had finished his work, and said, â€œI will show you White Magic;
give me ink,â€ and proceeded to describe the front hall of our house in
London, saying that there were two horses at the door, and that a man
and woman soon came out, gave the horses each a piece of bread and
mounted. The thing was so probable that by the next mail I wrote asking
my mother to write down exactly what she was doing and where at half
past five (English time) on the evening of June 12. At the corresponding
time in Egypt Machmout was describing speaking to us of a â€œsittâ€ (lady)
having tea in a room which he described with some minuteness, and I am
waiting anxiously for her letter. The explanation which Weston gives us
of all these phenomena, is that a certain picture of people I know is
present in my mind, though I may not be aware of it,--present to my
subliminal self, I think, he says,--and that I give an unspoken
suggestion to the hypnotised Machmout. My explanation is that there
isnâ€™t any explanation, for no suggestion on my part would make my
brother go out and ride at the moment when Machmout says he is so doing
(if indeed we find that Machmoutâ€™s visions are chronologically correct).
Consequently I prefer the open mind and am prepared to believe anything.
Weston, however, does not speak quite so calmly or scientifically about
Machmoutâ€™s last performance, and since it took place, he has almost
entirely ceased to urge me to become a member of the Society for
Psychical Research, in order that I may no longer be hidebound by vain
superstitions.

Machmout will not exercise these powers if his own folk are present, for
he says that when he is in this state, if a man who knew Black Magic was
in the room, or knew that he was practising White Magic, he could get
the spirit who presides over the Black Magic to kill the spirit of White
Magic, for the Black Magic is the more potent, and the two are foes. And
as the spirit of White Magic is on occasions a powerful friend--he had
before now befriended Machmout in a manner which I consider
incredible--Machmout is very desirous that he should abide long with
him. But Englishmen it appears do not know the Black Magic, so with us
he is safe. The spirit of Black Magic, to speak to whom it is death,
Machmout saw once â€œbetween heaven and earth, and night and day,â€ so he
phrases it, on the Karnak road. He may be known, he told us, by the fact
that he is of paler skin than his people, that he has two long teeth,
one in each corner of his mouth, and that his eyes, which are white all
over, are as big as the eyes of a horse.

Machmout squatted himself comfortably in the corner, and I gave him the
piece of black American cloth. As some minutes must elapse before he
gets into the hypnotic state in which the visions begin, I strolled out
on to the balcony for coolness. It was the hottest night we had yet had,
and though the sun had set three hours, the thermometer still registered
close on 100Â°. Above, the sky seemed veiled with grey, where it should
have been dark velvety blue, and a fitful puffing wind from the south
threatened three days of the sandy intolerable khamseen. A little way up
the street to the left was a small cafÃ© in front of which were glowing
and waning little glowworm specks of light from the water pipes of Arabs
sitting out there in the dark. From inside came the click of brass
castanets in the hands of some dancing-girl, sounding sharp and precise
against the wailing bagpipe music of the strings and pipes which
accompany these movements which Arabs love and Europeans think so
unpleasing. Eastwards the sky was paler and luminous, for the moon was
imminently rising, and even as I looked the red rim of the enormous disc
cut the line of the desert, and on the instant with a curious aptness,
one of the Arabs outside the cafÃ© broke out into that wonderful chant--

    â€œI cannot sleep for longing for thee, O full moon
     Far is thy throne over Mecca, slip down, O beloved, to me.â€

Immediately afterwards I heard the piping monotone of Machmoutâ€™s voice
begin, and in a moment or two I went inside.

We have found that the experiments gave the quickest result by contact,
a fact which confirmed Weston in his explanation of them by thought
transference of some elaborate kind, which I confess I cannot
understand. He was writing at a table in the window when I came in, but
looked up.

â€œTake his hand,â€ he said, â€œat present he is quite incoherent.â€

â€œDo you explain that?â€ I asked.

â€œIt is closely analogous, so Myers thinks, to talking in sleep. He has
been saying something about a tomb. Do make a suggestion, and see if he
gives it right. He is remarkably sensitive and he responds quicker to
you than to me. Probably Abdulâ€™s funeral suggested the tomb!â€

A sudden thought struck me.

â€œHush!â€ I said, â€œI want to listen.â€

Machmoutâ€™s head was thrown a little back, and he held the hand in which
was the piece of cloth rather above his face. As usual he was talking
very slowly, and in a high staccato voice, absolutely unlike his usual
tones.

â€œOn one side of the grave,â€ he piped, â€œis a tamarisk tree, and the green
beetles make _fantasia_ about it. On the other side is a mud wall. There
are many other graves about, but they are all asleep. This is _the_
grave, because it is awake, and is moist and not sandy.â€

â€œI thought so,â€ said Weston, â€œIt is Abdulâ€™s grave he is talking about.â€

â€œThere is a red moon sitting on the desert,â€ continued Machmout, â€œand it
is now. There is the puffing of khamseen, and much dust coming. The moon
is red with dust, and because it is low.â€

â€œStill sensitive to external conditions,â€ said Weston. â€œThat is rather
curious. Pinch him, will you?â€

I pinched Machmout; he did not pay the slightest attention.

â€œIn the last house of the street, and in the doorway stands a man. Ah!
ah!â€ cried the boy suddenly, â€œit is the Black Magic he knows. Donâ€™t let
him come. He is going out of the house,â€ he shrieked, â€œhe is coming--no,
he is going the other way, towards the moon and the grave. He has the
Black Magic with him, which can raise the dead, and he has a murdering
knife, and a spade. I cannot see his face for the Black Magic is between
it and my eyes.â€

Weston had got up, and, like me, was hanging on Machmoutâ€™s words.

â€œWe will go there,â€ he said. â€œHere is an opportunity of testing it.
Listen a moment.â€

â€œHe is walking, walking, walking,â€ piped Machmout, â€œstill walking to the
moon and the grave. The moon sits no longer on the desert, but has
sprung up a little way.â€

I pointed out of the window.

â€œThat at any rate is true,â€ I said.

Weston took the cloth out of Machmoutâ€™s hand, and the piping ceased. In
a moment he stretched himself, and rubbed his eyes.

â€œKhalÃ¡s,â€ he said.

â€œYes, it is KhalÃ¡s.â€

â€œDid I tell you of the sitt in England?â€ he asked.

â€œYes, oh, yes,â€ I answered; â€œthank you, little Machmout. The White Magic
was very good to-night. Get you to bed.â€

Machmout trotted obediently out of the room, and Weston closed the door
after him.

â€œWe must be quick,â€ he said. â€œIt is worth while going and giving the
thing a chance, though I wish he had seen something less gruesome. The
odd thing is that he was not at the funeral, and yet he describes the
grave accurately. What do you make of it?â€

â€œI make that the White Magic has shown Machmout that somebody with
black magic is going to Abdulâ€™s grave, perhaps to rob it,â€ I answered
resolutely.

â€œWhat are we to do when we get there?â€ asked Weston.

â€œSee the Black Magic at work. Personally I am in a blue funk. So are
you.â€

â€œThere is no such thing as Black Magic,â€ said Weston. â€œAh, I have it.
Give me that orange.â€

Weston rapidly skinned it, and cut from the rind two circles as big as a
five shilling piece, and two long, white fangs of skin. The first he
fixed in his eye, the two latter in the corners of his mouth.

â€œThe spirit of Black Magic?â€ I asked.

â€œThe same.â€

He took up a long black burnous and wrapped it round him. Even in the
bright lamp light, the spirit of black magic was a sufficiently terrific
personage.

â€œI donâ€™t believe in black magic,â€ he said, â€œbut others do. If it is
necessary to put a stop to--to anything that is going on, we will hoist
the man on his own petard. Come along. Whom do you suspect it is--I
mean, of course, who was the person you were thinking of when your
thoughts were transferred to Machmout.â€

â€œWhat Machmout said,â€ I answered, â€œsuggested Achmet to me.â€

Weston indulged in a laugh of scientific incredulity, and we set off.

The moon, as the boy had told us, was just clear of the horizon, and as
it rose higher, its colour at first red and sombre, like the blaze of
some distant conflagration, paled to a tawny yellow. The hot wind from
the south, blowing no longer fitfully but with a steadily increasing
violence was thick with sand, and of an incredibly scorching heat, and
the tops of the palm trees in the garden of the deserted hotel on the
right were lashing themselves to and fro with a harsh rattle of dry
leaves. The cemetery lay on the outskirts of the village, and, as long
as our way lay between the mud walls of the huddling street, the wind
came to us only as the heat from behind closed furnace doors. Every now
and then with a whisper and whistle rising into a great buffeting flap,
a sudden whirlwind of dust would scour some twenty yards along the road,
and then break like a shore-quenched wave against one or other of the
mud walls or throw itself heavily against a house and fall in a shower
of sand. But once free of obstructions we were opposed to the full heat
and blast of the wind which blew full in our teeth. It was the first
summer khamseen of the year, and for the moment I wished I had gone
north with the tourist and the quail and the billiard marker, for
khamseen fetches the marrow out of the bones, and turns the body to
blotting paper. We passed no one in the street, and the only sound we
heard, except the wind, was the howling of moonstruck dogs.

The cemetery is surrounded by a tall mud-built wall, and sheltering for
a few moments under this we discussed our movements. The row of
tamarisks close to which the tomb lay went down the centre of the
graveyard, and by skirting the wall outside and climbing softly over
where they approached it, the fury of the wind might help us to get near
the grave without being seen, if anyone happened to be there. We had
just decided on this, and were moving on to put the scheme into
execution, when the wind dropped for a moment, and in the silence we
could hear the chump of the spade being driven into the earth, and what
gave me a sudden thrill of intimate horror, the cry of the
carrion-feeding hawk from the dusty sky just overhead.

Two minutes later we were creeping up in the shade of the tamarisks, to
where Abdul had been buried. The great green beetles which live on the
trees were flying about blindly, and once or twice one dashed into my
face with a whirr of mail-clad wings. When we were within some twenty
yards of the grave we stopped for a moment, and, looking cautiously out
from our shelter of tamarisks, saw the figure of a man already waist
deep in the earth, digging out the newly turned grave. Weston, who was
standing behind me had adjusted the characteristics of the spirit of
Black Magic so as to be ready for emergencies, and turning round
suddenly, and finding myself unawares face to face with that realistic
impersonation, though my nerves are not precariously strong, I could
have found it within me to shriek aloud. But that unsympathetic man of
iron only shook with suppressed laughter, and, holding the eyes in his
hand, motioned me forward again without speaking to where the trees grew
thicker. There we stood not a dozen yards away from the grave.

We waited, I suppose, for some ten minutes, while the man, whom we saw
to be Achmet, toiled on at his impious task. He was entirely naked, and
his brown skin glistened with the dews of exertion in the moonlight. At
times he chattered in a cold uncanny manner to himself, and once or
twice he stopped for breath. Then he began scraping the earth away with
his hands, and soon afterwards searched in his clothes which were lying
near for a piece of rope, with which he stepped into the grave, and in a
moment reappeared again with both ends in his hands. Then, standing
astride the grave, he pulled strongly, and one end of the coffin
appeared above the ground. He chipped a piece of the lid away to make
sure that he had the right end, and then, setting it upright, wrenched
off the top with his knife and there faced us leaning against the coffin
lid, the small shrivelled figure of the dead Abdul, swathed like a baby
in white.

I was just about to motion the spirit of Black Magic to make his
appearance, when Machmoutâ€™s words came into my head: â€œHe has with him
the Black Magic which can raise the dead,â€ and sudden overwhelming
curiosity, which froze disgust and horror into chill unfeeling things,
came over me.

â€œWait,â€ I whispered to Weston, â€œhe will use the Black Magic.â€

Again the wind dropped for a moment, and again, in the silence that came
with it, I heard the chiding of the hawk overhead, this time nearer, and
thought I heard more birds than one.

Achmet meantime had taken the covering from off the face, and had undone
the swathing band, which at the moment after death is bound round the
chin to close the jaw, and in Arab burial is always left there, and from
where we stood I could see that the jaw dropped when the bandage was
untied, as if, though the wind blew towards us with a ghastly scent of
mortality on it, the muscles were not even now set, though the man had
been dead sixty hours. But still a rank and burning curiosity to see
what this unclean ghoul would do next stifled all other feelings in my
mind. He seemed not to notice, or, at any rate, to disregard that mouth
gaping awry, and moved about nimbly in the moonlight.

He took from a pocket of his clothes, which were lying near, two small
black objects, which now are safely embedded in the mud at the bottom of
the Nile, and rubbed them briskly together. By degrees they grew
luminous with a sickly yellow pallor of light, and from his hands went
up a wavy, phosphorescent flame. One of these cubes he placed in the
open mouth of the corpse, the other in his own, and, taking the dead man
closely in his arms as though he would indeed dance with death, he
breathed long breaths from his mouth into that dead cavern which was
pressed to his. Suddenly he started back with a quick-drawn breath of
wonder and perhaps of horror, and stood for a space as if irresolute,
for the cube which the dead man held instead of lying loosely in the
jaw, was pressed tight between clenched teeth. After a moment of
irresolution he stepped back quickly to his clothes again, and took up
from near them the knife with which he had stripped off the coffin lid,
and holding this in one hand behind his back, with the other he took out
the cube from the dead manâ€™s mouth, though with a visible exhibition of
force, and spoke.

â€œAbdul,â€ he said, â€œI am your friend, and I swear I will give your money
to Mohamed, if you will tell me where it is.â€

Certain I am that the lips of the dead moved, and the eyelids fluttered
for a moment like the wings of a wounded bird, but at that sight, the
horror so grew on me that I was physically incapable of stifling the cry
that rose to my lips, and Achmet turned round. Next moment the complete
Spirit of Black Magic glided out of the shade of the trees, and stood
before him. The wretched man stood for a moment without stirring, then,
turning with shaking knees to flee, he stepped back and fell into the
grave he had just opened.

Weston turned on me angrily, dropping the eyes and the teeth of the
Afrit.

â€œYou spoiled it all,â€ he cried. â€œIt would perhaps have been the most
interesting ...â€ and his eye lighted on the dead Abdul, who peered
open-eyed from the coffin, then swayed, tottered, and fell forward, face
downwards on the ground close to him. For one moment he lay there, and
then the body rolled slowly on to its back without visible cause of
movement, and lay staring into the sky. The face was covered with dust,
but with the dust was mingled fresh blood. A nail had caught the cloth
that wound him, underneath which as usual were the clothes in which he
had died, for the Arabs do not wash their dead, and it had torn a great
rent through them all, leaving the right shoulder bare.

Weston strove to speak once, but failed. Then:

â€œI will go and inform the police,â€ he said, â€œif you will stop here, and
see that Achmet does not get out.â€

But this I altogether refused to do, and, after covering the body with
the coffin to protect it from the hawks, we secured Achmetâ€™s arms with
the rope he had already used that night, and took him off to Luxor.

Next morning Mohamed came to see us.

â€œI thought Achmet knew where the money was,â€ he said exultantly.

â€œWhere was it?â€

â€œIn a little purse tied round the shoulder. The dog had already begun
stripping it. Seeâ€--and he brought it out of his pocket--â€œit is all
there in those English notes, five pounds each, and there are twenty of
them.â€

Our conclusion was slightly different, for even Weston will allow that
Achmet _hoped_ to learn from dead lips the secret of the treasure, and
then to kill the man anew and bury him. But that is pure conjecture.

The only other point of interest lies in the two black cubes which we
picked up, and found to be graven with curious characters. These I put
one evening into Machmoutâ€™s hand, when he was exhibiting to us his
curious powers of â€œthought transference.â€ The effect was that he
screamed aloud, crying out that the Black Magic had come, and though I
did not feel certain about that, I thought they would be safer in
mid-Nile. Weston grumbled a little, and said that he had wanted to take
them to the British Museum, but that I feel sure was an afterthought.




THE SHOOTINGS OF ACHNALEISH


The dining-room windows, both front and back, the one looking into
Oakley Street, the other into a small back-yard with three sooty shrubs
in it (known as the garden), were all open, so that the table stood in
mid-stream of such air as there was. But in spite of this the heat was
stifling, since, for once in a way, July had remembered that it was the
duty of good little summers to be hot. Hot in consequence it had been:
heat reverberated from the house-walls, it rose through the boot from
the paving-stones, it poured down from a large superheated sun that
walked the sky all day long in a benignant and golden manner. Dinner was
over, but the small party of four who had eaten it still lingered.

Mabel Armytage--it was she who had laid down the duty of good little
summers--spoke first.

â€œOh, Jim, it sounds too heavenly,â€ she said. â€œIt makes me feel cool to
think of it. Just fancy, in a fortnightâ€™s time we shall all four of us
be there, in our own shooting-lodge----â€

â€œFarm-house,â€ said Jim.

â€œWell, I didnâ€™t suppose it was Balmoral, with our own coffee-coloured
salmon river roaring down to join the waters of our own loch.â€

Jim lit a cigarette.

â€œMabel, you mustnâ€™t think of shooting-lodges and salmon rivers and
lochs,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s a farm-house, rather a big one, though Iâ€™m sure
we shall find it hard enough to fit in. The salmon river you speak of is
a big burn, no more, though it appears that salmon have been caught
there. But when I saw it, it would have required as much cleverness on
the part of a salmon to fit into it as it will require on our parts to
fit into our farm-house. And the loch is a tarn.â€

Mabel snatched the â€œGuide to Highland Shootingsâ€ out of my hand with a
rudeness that even a sister should not show her elder brother, and
pointed a withering finger at her husband.

â€œâ€˜Achnaleish,â€™â€ she declaimed, â€œâ€˜is situated in one of the grandest and
most remote parts of Sutherlandshire. To be let from August 12 till the
end of October, the lodge with shooting and fishing belonging.
Proprietor supplies two keepers, fishing-gillie, boat on loch, and dogs.
Tenant should secure about 500 head of grouse and 500 head of mixed
game, including partridge, black-game, woodcock, snipe, roe deer; also
rabbits in very large number, especially by ferreting. Large baskets of
brown trout can be taken from the loch, and whenever the water is high
sea-trout and occasional salmon. Lodge containsâ€™--I canâ€™t go on; itâ€™s
too hot, and you know the rest. Rent only Â£350!â€

Jim listened patiently.

â€œWell?â€ he said. â€œWhat then?â€

Mabel rose with dignity.

â€œIt _is_ a shooting-lodge with a salmon river and a loch, just as I have
said. Come, Madge, letâ€™s go out. It is too hot to sit in the house.â€

â€œYouâ€™ll be calling Buxton â€˜the major-domoâ€™ next,â€ remarked Jim, as his
wife passed him.

I had picked up the â€œGuide to Highland Shootingsâ€ again which my sister
had so unceremoniously plucked from me, and idly compared the rent and
attractions of Achnaleish with other places that were to let.

â€œSeems cheap, too,â€ I said. â€œWhy, hereâ€™s another place, just the same
sort of size and bag, for which they ask Â£500; hereâ€™s another at Â£550.â€

Jim helped himself to coffee.

â€œYes, it does seem cheap,â€ he said. â€œBut, of course, itâ€™s very remote:
it took me a good three hours from Lairg, and I donâ€™t suppose I was
driving very noticeably below the legal limit. But itâ€™s cheap, as you
say.â€

Now, Madge (who is my wife) has her prejudices. One of them--an
extremely expensive one--is that anything cheap has always some hidden
and subtle drawback, which you discover when it is too late. And the
drawback to cheap houses is drains or offices--the presence, so to
speak, of the former, and the absence of the latter. So I hazarded
these.

â€œNo, the drains are all right,â€ said Jim, â€œbecause I got the certificate
of the inspector, and as for offices, really I think the servantsâ€™ parts
are better than ours. No--why itâ€™s so cheap, I canâ€™t imagine.â€

â€œPerhaps the bag is overstated,â€ I suggested.

Jim again shook his head.

â€œNo, thatâ€™s the funny thing about it,â€ he said. â€œThe bag, I am sure, is
understated. At least, I walked over the moor for a couple of hours, and
the whole place is simply crawling with hares. Why, you could shoot five
hundred hares alone on it.â€

â€œHares?â€ I asked. â€œThatâ€™s rather queer, so far up, isnâ€™t it?â€

Jim laughed.

â€œSo I thought. And the hares are queer, too; big beasts, very dark in
colour. Letâ€™s join the others outside. Jove! what a hot night!â€

       *       *       *       *       *

Even as Mabel had said, that day fortnight found us all four, the four
who had stifled and sweltered in Chelsea, flying through the cool and
invigorating winds of the North. The road was in admirable condition,
and I should not wonder if for the second time Jimâ€™s big Napier went not
noticeably below the legal limit. The servants had gone straight up,
starting the same day as we, while we had got out at Perth, motored to
Inverness, and were now, on the second day, nearing our goal. Never
have I seen so depopulated a road. I do not suppose there was a man to a
mile of it.

We had left Lairg about five that afternoon, expecting to arrive at
Achnaleish by eight, but one disaster after another overtook us. Now it
was the engine, and now a tyre that delayed us, till finally we stopped
some eight miles short of our destination, to light up, for with evening
had come a huge wrack of cloud out of the West, so that we were cheated
of the clear post-sunset twilight of the North. Then on again, till,
with a little dancing of the car over a bridge, Jim said:

â€œThatâ€™s the bridge of our salmon river; so look out for the turning up
to the lodge. It is to the right, and only a narrow track. You can send
her along, Sefton,â€ he called to the chauffeur; â€œwe shanâ€™t meet a soul.â€

I was sitting in front, finding the speed and the darkness
extraordinarily exhilarating. A bright circle of light was cast by our
lamps, fading into darkness in front, while at the sides, cut off by the
casing of the lamps, the transition into blackness was sharp and sudden.
Every now and then, across this circle of illumination some wild thing
would pass: now a bird, with hurried flutter of wings when it saw the
speed of the luminous monster, would just save itself from being knocked
over; now a rabbit feeding by the side of the road would dash onto it
and then bounce back again; but more frequently it would be a hare that
sprang up from its feeding and raced in front of us. They seemed dazed
and scared by the light, unable to wheel into the darkness again, until
time and again I thought we must run over one, so narrowly, in giving a
sort of desperate sideways leap, did it miss our wheels. Then it seemed
that one started up almost from under us, and I saw, to my surprise, it
was enormous in size, and in colour apparently quite black. For some
hundred yards it raced in front of us, fascinated by the bright light
pursuing it, then, like the rest, it dashed for the darkness. But it was
too late, and with a horrid jolt we ran over it. At once Sefton slowed
down and stopped, for Jimâ€™s rule is to go back always and make sure that
any poor run-over is dead. So, when we stopped, the chauffeur jumped
down and ran back.

â€œWhat was it?â€ Jim asked me, as we waited.

â€œA hare.â€

Sefton came running back.

â€œYes, sir, quite dead,â€ he said. â€œI picked it up, sir.â€

â€œWhat for?â€

â€œThought you might like to see it, sir. Itâ€™s the biggest hare I ever
see, and itâ€™s quite black.â€

It was immediately after this that we came to the track up to the house,
and in a few minutes we were within doors. There we found that if
â€œshooting-lodgeâ€ was a term unsuitable, so also was â€œfarmhouse,â€ so
roomy, excellently proportioned, and well furnished was our dwelling,
while the contentment that beamed from Buxtonâ€™s face was sufficient
testimonial for the offices. In the hall, too, with its big open
fireplace, were a couple of big solemn bookcases, full of serious works,
such as some educated minister might have left, and, coming down dressed
for dinner before the others, I dipped into the shelves. Then--something
must long have been vaguely simmering in my brain, for I pounced on the
book as soon as I saw it--I came upon Elwesâ€™s â€œFolklore of the North
West Highlands,â€ and looked out â€œHareâ€ in the index. Then I read:

â€œNor is it only witches that are believed to have the power of changing
themselves into animals.... Men and women on whom no suspicion of the
sort lies are thought to be able to do this, and to don the bodies of
certain animals, notably hares.... Such, according to local
superstition, are easily distinguishable by their size and colour, which
approaches jet black.â€

I was up and out early next morning, prey to the vivid desire that
attacks many folk in new places--namely, to look on the fresh country
and the new horizons--and, on going out, certainly the surprise was
great. For I had imagined an utterly lonely and solitary habitation;
instead, scarce half a mile away, down the steep brae-side at the top of
which stood our commodious farm-house, ran a typically Scotch village
street, the hamlet no doubt of Achnaleish. So steep was this hill-side
that the village was really remote; if it was half a mile away in
crow-flying measurement, it must have been a couple of hundred yards
below us. But its existence was the odd thing to me: there were some
four dozen houses, at the least, while we had not seen half that number
since leaving Lairg. A mile away, perhaps, lay the shining shield of the
western sea; to the other side, away from the village, I had no
difficulty in recognising the river and the loch. The house, in fact,
was set on a hogâ€™s back; from all sides it must needs be climbed to.
But, as is the custom of the Scots, no house, however small, should be
without its due brightness of flowers, and the walls of this were purple
with clematis and orange with tropÃ¦olum. It all looked very placid and
serene and home-like.

I continued my tour of exploration, and came back rather late for
breakfast. A slight check in the dayâ€™s arrangements had occurred, for
the head keeper, Maclaren, had not come up, and the second, Sandie Ross,
reported that the reason for this had been the sudden death of his
mother the evening before. She was not known to be ill, but just as she
was going to bed she had thrown up her arms, screamed suddenly as if
with fright, and was found to be dead. Sandie, who repeated this news to
me after breakfast, was just a slow, polite Scotchman, rather shy,
rather awkward. Just as he finished--we were standing about outside the
back-door--there came up from the stables the smart, very
English-looking Sefton. In one hand he carried the black hare.

He touched his hat to me as he went in.

â€œJust to show it to Mr Armytage, sir,â€ he said. â€œSheâ€™s as black as a
boot.â€

He turned into the door, but not before Sandie Ross had seen what he
carried, and the slow, polite Scotchman was instantly turned into some
furtive, frightened-looking man.

â€œAnd where might it be that you found that, sir?â€ he asked.

Now, the black-hare superstition had already begun to intrigue me.

â€œWhy does that interest you?â€ I asked.

The slow Scotch look was resumed with an effort.

â€œItâ€™ll no interest me,â€ he said. â€œI just asked. There are unco many
black hares in Achnaleish.â€

Then his curiosity got the better of him.

â€œSheâ€™d have been nigh to where the road passes by and on to Achnaleish?â€
he asked.

â€œThe hare? Yes, we found her on the road there.â€

Sandie turned away.

â€œShe aye sat there,â€ he said.

There were a number of little plantations climbing up the steep
hill-side from Achnaleish to the moor above, and we had a pleasant slack
sort of morning shooting there, walking through and round them with a
nondescript tribe of beaters, among whom the serious Buxton figured. We
had fair enough sport, but of the hares which Jim had seen in such
profusion none that morning came to the gun, till at last, just before
lunch, there came out of the apex of one of these plantations, some
thirty yards from where Jim was standing, a very large, dark-coloured
hare. For one moment I saw him hesitate--for he holds the correct view
about long or doubtful shots at hares--then he put up his gun to fire.
Sandie, who had walked round outside, after giving the beaters their
instructions, was at this moment close to him, and with incredible
quickness rushed upon him and with his stick struck up the barrels of
the gun before he could fire.

â€œBlack hare!â€ he cried. â€œYeâ€™d shoot a black hare? Thereâ€™s no shooting of
hares at all in Achnaleish, and mark that.â€

Never have I seen so sudden and extraordinary a change in a manâ€™s face:
it was as if he had just prevented some blackguard of the street from
murdering his wife.

â€œAnâ€™ the sickness about anâ€™ all,â€ he added indignantly. â€œWhen the puir
folk escape from their peching fevered bodies an hour or two, to the
caller muirs.â€

Then he seemed to recover himself.

â€œI ask your pardon, sir,â€ he said to Jim. â€œI was upset with ane thing
anâ€™ anither, anâ€™ the black hare ye found deid last night--eh, Iâ€™m
blatherinâ€™ again. But thereâ€™s no a hare shot on Achnaleish, thatâ€™s
sure.â€

Jim was still looking in mere speechless astonishment at Sandie when I
came up. And, though shooting is dear to me, so too is folk-lore.

â€œBut weâ€™ve taken the shooting of Achnaleish, Sandie,â€ I said. â€œThere was
nothing there about not shooting hares.â€

Sandie suddenly boiled up again for a minute.

â€œAnâ€™ mebbe there was nothing there about shooting the bairns and the
weemen!â€ he cried.

I looked round, and saw that by now the beaters had all come through the
wood: of them Buxton and Jimâ€™s valet, who was also among them, stood
apart: all the rest were standing round us two with gleaming eyes and
open mouths, hanging on the debate, and forced, so I imagined, from
their imperfect knowledge of English to attend closely in order to catch
the drift of what went on. Every now and then a murmur of Gaelic passed
between them, and this somehow I found peculiarly disconcerting.

â€œBut what have the hares to do with the children or women of
Achnaleish?â€ I asked.

There was no reply to this beyond the reiterated sentence: â€œThereâ€™s na
shooting of hares in Achnaleish whatever,â€ and then Sandie turned to
Jim.

â€œThatâ€™s the end of the bit wood, sir,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™ve been aâ€™ roound.â€

Certainly the beat had been very satisfactory. A roe had fallen to Jim
(one ought also to have fallen to me, but remained, if not standing, at
any rate running away). We had a dozen of black-game, four pigeons, six
brace of grouse (these were, of course, but outliers, as we had not gone
on to the moor proper at all), some thirty rabbits, and four couple of
woodcock. This, it must be understood, was just from the fringe of
plantations about the house, but this was all we meant to do to-day,
making only a morning of it, since our ladies had expressly desired
first lessons in the art of angling in the afternoon, so that they too
could be busy. Excellently too had Sandie worked the beat, leaving us
now, after going, as he said, all round, a couple of hundred yards only
from the house, at a few minutes to two.

So, after a little private signalling from Jim to me, he spoke to
Sandie, dropping the hare-question altogether.

â€œWell, the beat has gone excellently,â€ he said, â€œand this afternoon
weâ€™ll be fishing. Please settle with the beaters every evening, and tell
me what you have paid out. Good morning to you all.â€

We walked back to the house, but the moment we had turned a hum of
confabulation began behind us, and, looking back, I saw Sandie and all
the beaters in close whispering conclave. Then Jim spoke.

â€œMore in your line than mine,â€ he said; â€œI prefer shooting a hare to
routing out some cock-and-bull story as to why I shouldnâ€™t. What does it
all mean?â€

I mentioned what I had found in Elwes last night.

â€œThen do they think it was we who killed the old lady on the road, and
that I was going to kill somebody else this morning?â€ he asked. â€œHow
does one know that they wonâ€™t say that rabbits are their aunts, and
woodcock their uncles, and grouse their children? I never heard such
rot, and to-morrow weâ€™ll have a hare drive. Blow the grouse! Weâ€™ll
settle this hare-question first.â€

Jim by this time was in the frame of mind typical of the English when
their rights are threatened. He had the shooting of Achnaleish, on which
were hares, sir, hares. And if he chose to shoot hares, neither papal
bull nor royal charter could stop him.

â€œThen thereâ€™ll be a row,â€ said I, and Jim sniffed scornfully.

At lunch Sandieâ€™s remark about the â€œsickness,â€ which I had forgotten
till that moment, was explained.

â€œFancy that horrible influenza getting here,â€ said Madge. â€œMabel and I
went down to the village this morning, and, oh, Ted, you can get all
sorts of things, from mackintoshes to peppermints, at the most heavenly
shop, and there was a child there looking awfully ill and feverish. So
we inquired: it was the â€˜sicknessâ€™--that was all they knew. But, from
what the woman said, itâ€™s clearly influenza. Sudden fever, and all the
rest of it.â€

â€œBad type?â€ I asked.

â€œYes; there have been several deaths already among the old people from
pneumonia following it.â€

Now, I hope that as an Englishman I too have a notion of my rights, and
attempt anyhow to enforce them, as a general rule, if they are wantonly
threatened. But if a mad bull wishes to prevent my going across a
certain field, I do not insist on my rights, but go round instead, since
I see no reasonable hope of convincing the bull that according to the
constitution of my country I may walk in this field unmolested. And that
afternoon, as Madge and I drifted about the loch, while I was not
employed in disentangling her flies from each other or her hair or my
coat, I pondered over our position with regard to the hares and men of
Achnaleish, and thought that the question of the bull and the field
represented our standpoint pretty accurately. Jim _had_ the shooting of
Achnaleish, and that undoubtedly included the right to shoot hares: so
too he might have the right to walk over a field in which was a mad
bull. But it seemed to me not more futile to argue with the bull than to
hope to convince these folk of Achnaleish that the hares were--as was
assuredly the case--only hares, and not the embodiments of their
friends and relations. For that, beyond all doubt, was their belief, and
it would take, not half an hourâ€™s talk, but perhaps a couple of
generations of education to kill that belief, or even to reduce it to
the level of a superstition. At present it was no superstition--the
terror and incredulous horror on Sandieâ€™s face when Jim raised his gun
to fire at the hare told me that--it was a belief as sober and
commonplace as our own belief that the hares were not incarnations of
living folk in Achnaleish. Also, virulent influenza was raging in the
place, and Jim proposed to have a hare-drive to-morrow! What would
happen?

That evening Jim raved about it in the smoking-room.

â€œBut, good gracious, man, what can they _do_?â€ he cried. â€œWhatâ€™s the use
of an old gaffer from Achnaleish saying Iâ€™ve shot his grand-daughter
and, when he is asked to produce the corpse, telling the jury that weâ€™ve
eaten it, but that he has got the skin as evidence? What skin? A
hare-skin! Oh, folk-lore is all very well in its way, a nice subject for
discussion when topics are scarce, but donâ€™t tell me it can enter into
practical life. What can they do?â€

â€œThey can shoot us,â€ I remarked.

â€œThe canny, God-fearing Scotchmen shoot us for shooting hares?â€ he
asked.

â€œWell, itâ€™s a possibility. However, I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll have much of a
hare-drive in any case.â€

â€œWhy not?â€

â€œBecause you wonâ€™t get a single native beater, and you wonâ€™t get a
keeper to come either. Youâ€™ll have to go with Buxton and your man.â€

â€œThen Iâ€™ll discharge Sandie,â€ snapped Jim.

â€œThat would be a pity: he knows his work.â€

Jim got up.

â€œWell, his work to-morrow will be to drive hares for you and me,â€ said
Jim. â€œOr do you funk?â€

â€œI funk,â€ I replied.

The scene next morning was extremely short. Jim and I went out before
breakfast, and found Sandie at the back door, silent and respectful. In
the yard were a dozen young Highlanders, who had beaten for us the day
before.

â€œMorning, Sandie,â€ said Jim shortly. â€œWeâ€™ll drive hares to-day. We ought
to get a lot in those narrow gorges up above. Get a dozen beaters more,
can you?â€

â€œThere will be na hare-drive here,â€ said Sandie quietly.

â€œI have given you your orders,â€ said Jim.

Sandie turned to the group of beaters outside and spoke half a dozen
words in Gaelic. Next moment the yard was empty, and they were all
running down the hillside towards Achnaleish. One stood on the skyline a
moment, waving his arms, making some signal, as I supposed, to the
village below. Then Sandie turned again.

â€œAnâ€™ whaur are your beaters, sir?â€ he asked.

For the moment I was afraid Jim was going to strike him. But he
controlled himself.

â€œYou are discharged,â€ he said.

The hare-drive, therefore, since there were neither beaters nor
keeper--Maclaren, the head-keeper, having been given this â€œday-offâ€ to
bury his mother--was clearly out of the question, and Jim, still
blustering rather, but a good bit taken aback at the sudden disciplined
defection of the beaters, was in betting humour that they would all
return by to-morrow morning. Meanwhile the post which should have
arrived before now had not come, though Mabel from her bedroom window
had seen the post-cart on its way up the drive a quarter of an hour ago.
At that a sudden idea struck me, and I ran to the edge of the hogâ€™s back
on which the house was set. It was even as I thought: the post-cart was
just striking the high-road below, going away from the house and back to
the village, without having left our letters.

I went back to the dining-room. Everything apparently was going wrong
this morning: the bread was stale, the milk was not fresh, and the bell
was rung for Buxton. Quite so: neither milkman nor baker had called.

From the point of view of folk-lore this was admirable.

â€œThereâ€™s another cock-and-bull story called â€˜taboo,â€™â€ I said. â€œIt means
that nobody will supply you with anything.â€

â€œMy dear fellow, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing,â€ said Jim,
helping himself to marmalade.

I laughed.

â€œYou are irritated,â€ I said, â€œbecause you are beginning to be afraid
that there is something in it.â€

â€œYes, thatâ€™s quite true,â€ he said. â€œBut who could have supposed there
was anything in it? Ah, dash it! there _canâ€™t_ be. A hare is a hare.â€

â€œExcept when it is your first cousin,â€ said I.

â€œThen I shall go out and shoot first cousins by myself,â€ he said.

That, I am glad to say, in the light of what followed, we dissuaded him
from doing, and instead he went off with Madge down the burn. And I, I
may confess, occupied myself the whole morning, ensconced in a thick
piece of scrub on the edge of the steep brae above Achnaleish, in
watching through a field-glass what went on there. One could see as from
a balloon almost: the street with its houses was spread like a map
below.

First, then, there was a funeral--the funeral, I suppose, of the mother
of Maclaren, attended, I should say, by the whole village. But after
that there was no dispersal of the folk to their work: it was as if it
was the Sabbath; they hung about the street talking. Now one group would
break up, but it would only go to swell another, and no one went either
to his house or to the fields. Then, shortly before lunch, another idea
occurred to me, and I ran down the hill-side, appearing suddenly in the
street, to put it to the test. Sandie was there, but he turned his back
square on me, as did everybody else, and as I approached any group talk
fell dead. But a certain movement seemed to be going on; where they
stood and talked before, they now moved and were silent. Soon I saw what
that meant. None would remain in the street with me: every man was going
to his house.

The end house of the street was clearly the â€œheavenly shopâ€ we had been
told of yesterday. The door was open and a small child was looking round
it as I approached, for my plan was to go in, order something, and try
to get into conversation. But, while I was still a yard or two off, I
saw through the glass of the door a man inside come quickly up and pull
the child roughly away, banging the door and locking it. I knocked and
rang, but there was no response: only from inside came the crying of the
child.

The street which had been so busy and populous was now completely empty;
it might have been the street of some long-deserted place, but that thin
smoke curled here and there above the houses. It was as silent, too, as
the grave, but, for all that, I knew it was watching. From every house,
I felt sure, I was being watched by eyes of mistrust and hate, yet no
sign of living being could I see. There was to me something rather eerie
about this: to know one is watched by invisible eyes is never, I
suppose, quite a comfortable sensation; to know that those eyes are all
hostile does not increase the sense of security. So I just climbed back
up the hill-side again, and from my thicket above the brae again I
peered down. Once more the street was full.

Now, all this made me uneasy: the taboo had been started, and--since not
a soul had been near us since Sandie gave the word, whatever it was,
that morning--was in excellent working order. Then what was the purport
of these meetings and colloquies? What else threatened? The afternoon
told me.

It was about two oâ€™clock when these meetings finally broke up, and at
once the whole village left the street for the hill-sides, much as if
they were all returning to work. The only odd thing indeed was that no
one remained behind: women and children alike went out, all in little
parties of two and three. Some of these I watched rather idly, for I had
formed the hasty conclusion that they were all going back to their usual
employments, and saw that here a woman and girl were cutting dead
bracken and heather. That was reasonable enough, and I turned my glass
on others. Group after group I examined; all were doing the same thing,
cutting fuel ... fuel.

Then vaguely, with a sense of impossibility, a thought flashed across
me; again it flashed, more vividly. This time I left my hiding-place
with considerable alacrity and went to find Jim down by the burn. I told
him exactly what I had seen and what I believed it meant, and I fancy
that his belief in the possibility of folk-lore entering the domain of
practical life was very considerably quickened. In any case, it was not
a quarter of an hour afterwards that the chauffeur and I were going,
precisely as fast as the Napier was able, along the road to Lairg. We
had not told the women what my conjecture was, because we believed that,
making the dispositions we were making, there was no cause for
alarm-sounding. One private signal only existed between Jim within the
house that night and me outside. If my conjecture proved to be correct,
he was to place a light in the window of my room, which I should see
returning after dark from Lairg. My ostensible reason for going was to
get some local fishing-flies.

As we flowed--there is no other word for the movement of these big cars
but that--over the road to Lairg, I ran over everything in my mind. I
felt no doubt whatever that all the brushwood and kindling I had seen
being gathered in was to be piled after nightfall round our walls and
set on fire. This certainly would not be done till after dark; indeed,
we both felt sure that it would not be done till it was supposed that we
were all abed. It remained to see whether the police at Lairg agreed
with my conjecture, and it was to ascertain this that I was now flowing
there.

I told my story to the chief constable as soon as I got there, omitting
nothing and, I think, exaggerating nothing. His face got graver and
graver as I proceeded.

â€œYes, sir, you did right to come,â€ he said. â€œThe folk at Achnaleish are
the dourest and the most savage in all Scotland. Youâ€™ll have to give up
this hare-hunting, though, whatever,â€ he added.

He rang up his telephone.

â€œIâ€™ll get five men,â€ he said, â€œand Iâ€™ll be with you in ten minutes.â€

Our plan of campaign was simple. We were to leave the car well out of
sight of Achnaleish, and--supposing the signal was in my window--steal
up from all sides to command the house from every direction. It would
not be difficult to make our way unseen through the plantations that ran
up close to the house, and hidden at their margins we could see whether
the brushwood and heather was piled up round the lodge. There we should
wait to see if anybody attempted to fire it. That somebody, whenever he
showed his light, would be instantly covered by a rifle and challenged.

It was about ten when we dismounted and stalked our way up to the house.
The light burned in my window; all else was quiet. Personally, I was
unarmed, and so, when I had planted the men in places of advantageous
concealment round the house, my work was over. Then I returned to
Sergeant Duncan, the chief constable, at the corner of the hedge by the
garden, and waited.

How long we waited I do not know, but it seemed as if Ã¦ons slipped by
over us. Now and then an owl would hoot, now and then a rabbit ran out
from cover and nibbled the short sweet grass of the lawn. The night was
thickly overcast with clouds, and the house seemed no more than a black
blot, with slits of light where windows were lit within. By and by even
these slits of illumination were extinguished, and other lights appeared
in the top story. After a while they, too, vanished; no sign of life
appeared on the quiet house. Then suddenly the end came: I heard a foot
grate on the gravel; I saw the gleam of a lantern, and heard Duncanâ€™s
voice.

â€œMan,â€ he shouted, â€œif you move hand or foot I fire. My rifle-bead is
dead on you.â€

Then I blew the whistle; the others ran up, and in less than a minute it
was all over. The man we closed in on was Maclaren.

â€œThey killed my mither with that hell-carriage,â€ he said, â€œas she juist
sat on the road, puir body, who had niver hurt them.â€

And that seemed to him an excellent reason for attempting to burn us all
to death.

But it took time to get into the house: their preparations had been
singularly workmanlike, for every window and door on the ground floor
was wired up.

Now, we had Achnaleish for two months, but we had no wish to be burned
or otherwise murdered. What we wanted was not a prosecution of our
head-keeper, but peace, the necessaries of life, and beaters. For that
we were willing to shoot no hares, and release Maclaren. An hourâ€™s
conclave next morning settled these things; the ensuing two months were
most enjoyable, and relations were the friendliest.

But if anybody wants to test how far what Jim still calls cock-and-bull
stories can enter into practical life, I should suggest to him to go
a-shooting hares at Achnaleish.




HOW FEAR DEPARTED FROM THE LONG GALLERY


CHURCH-PEVERIL is a house so beset and frequented by spectres, both
visible and audible, that none of the family which it shelters under its
acre and a half of green copper roofs takes psychical phenomena with any
seriousness. For to the Peverils the appearance of a ghost is a matter
of hardly greater significance than is the appearance of the post to
those who live in more ordinary houses. It arrives, that is to say,
practically every day, it knocks (or makes other noises), it is observed
coming up the drive (or in other places). I myself, when staying there
have seen the present Mrs Peveril, who is rather short-sighted, peer
into the dusk, while we were taking our coffee on the terrace after
dinner, and say to her daughter:

â€œMy dear, was not that the Blue Lady who has just gone into the
shrubbery. I hope she wonâ€™t frighten Flo. Whistle for Flo, dear.â€

(Flo, it may be remarked, is the youngest and most precious of many
dachshunds).

Blanche Peveril gave a cursory whistle, and crunched the sugar left
unmelted at the bottom of her coffee-cup between her very white teeth.

â€œOh, darling, Flo isnâ€™t so silly as to mind,â€ she said. â€œPoor blue Aunt
Barbara is such a bore! Whenever I meet her she always looks as if she
wanted to speak to me, but when I say, â€˜What is it, Aunt Barbara?â€™ she
never utters, but only points somewhere towards the house, which is so
vague. I believe there was something she wanted to confess about two
hundred years ago, but she has forgotten what it is.â€

Here Flo gave two or three short pleased barks, and came out of the
shrubbery wagging her tail, and capering round what appeared to me to be
a perfectly empty space on the lawn.

â€œThere! Flo has made friends with her,â€ said Mrs Peveril. â€œI wonder why
she dresses in that very stupid shade of blue.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

From this it may be gathered that even with regard to psychical
phenomena there is some truth in the proverb that speaks of familiarity.
But the Peverils do not exactly treat their ghosts with contempt, since
most of that delightful family never despised anybody except such people
as avowedly did not care for hunting or shooting, or golf or skating.
And as all of their ghosts are of their family, it seems reasonable to
suppose that they all, even the poor Blue Lady, excelled at one time in
field-sports. So far then they harbour no such unkindness or contempt,
but only pity. Of one Peveril, indeed, who broke his neck in vainly
attempting to ride up the main staircase on a thoroughbred mare after
some monstrous and violent deed in the back-garden, they are very fond,
and Blanche comes downstairs in the morning with an eye unusually bright
when she can announce that Master Anthony was â€œvery loudâ€ last night. He
(apart from the fact of his having been so foul a ruffian) was a
tremendous fellow across country, and they like these indications of the
continuance of his superb vitality. In fact, it is supposed to be a
compliment, when you go to stay at Church-Peveril, to be assigned a
bedroom which is frequented by defunct members of the family. It means
that you are worthy to look on the august and villainous dead,
and you will find yourself shown into some vaulted or tapestried
chamber, without benefit of electric light, and are told that
great-great-grandmamma Bridget occasionally has vague business by the
fireplace, but it is better not to talk to her, and that you will hear
Master Anthony â€œawfully wellâ€ if he attempts the front staircase any
time before morning. There you are left for your nightâ€™s repose, and,
having quakingly undressed, begin reluctantly to put out your candles.
It is draughty in these great chambers, and the solemn tapestry swings
and bellows and subsides, and the firelight dances on the forms of
huntsmen and warriors and stern pursuits. Then you climb into your bed,
a bed so huge that you feel as if the desert of Sahara was spread for
you, and pray, like the mariners who sailed with St Paul, for day. And,
all the time, you are aware that Freddy and Harry and Blanche and
possibly even Mrs Peveril are quite capable of dressing up and making
disquieting tappings outside your door, so that when you open it some
inconjecturable horror fronts you. For myself, I stick steadily to the
assertion that I have an obscure valvular disease of the heart, and so
sleep undisturbed in the new wing of the house where Aunt Barbara, and
great-great-grandmamma Bridget and Master Anthony never penetrate. I
forget the details of great-great-grandmamma Bridget, but she certainly
cut the throat of some distant relation before she disembowelled herself
with the axe that had been used at Agincourt. Before that she had led a
very sultry life, crammed with amazing incident.

       *       *       *       *       *

But there is one ghost at Church-Peveril at which the family never
laugh, in which they feel no friendly and amused interest, and of which
they only speak just as much as is necessary for the safety of their
guests. More properly it should be described as two ghosts, for the
â€œhauntâ€ in question is that of two very young children, who were twins.
These, not without reason, the family take very seriously indeed. The
story of them, as told me by Mrs Peveril, is as follows:

In the year 1602, the same being the last of Queen Elizabethâ€™s reign, a
certain Dick Peveril was greatly in favour at Court. He was brother to
Master Joseph Peveril, then owner of the family house and lands, who two
years previously, at the respectable age of seventy-four, became father
of twin boys, first-born of his progeny. It is known that the royal and
ancient virgin had said to handsome Dick, who was nearly forty years his
brotherâ€™s junior, â€œâ€™Tis pity that you are not master of Church Peveril,â€
and these words probably suggested to him a sinister design. Be that as
it may, handsome Dick, who very adequately sustained the family
reputation for wickedness, set off to ride down to Yorkshire, and found
that, very conveniently, his brother Joseph had just been seized with an
apoplexy, which appeared to be the result of a continued spell of hot
weather combined with the necessity of quenching his thirst with an
augmented amount of sack, and had actually died while handsome Dick,
with God knows what thoughts in his mind, was journeying northwards.
Thus it came about that he arrived at Church-Peveril just in time for
his brotherâ€™s funeral. It was with great propriety that he attended the
obsequies, and returned to spend a sympathetic day or two of mourning
with his widowed sister-in-law, who was but a faint-hearted dame,
little fit to be mated with such hawks as these. On the second night of
his stay, he did that which the Peverils regret to this day. He entered
the room where the twins slept with their nurse, and quietly strangled
the latter as she slept. Then he took the twins and put them into the
fire which warms the long gallery. The weather, which up to the day of
Josephâ€™s death had been so hot, had changed suddenly to bitter cold, and
the fire was heaped high with burning logs and was exultant with flame.
In the core of this conflagration he struck out a cremation-chamber, and
into that he threw the two children, stamping them down with his
riding-boots. They could just walk, but they could not walk out of that
ardent place. It is said that he laughed as he added more logs. Thus he
became master of Church Peveril.

The crime was never brought home to him, but he lived no longer than a
year in the enjoyment of his blood-stained inheritance. When he lay
a-dying he made his confession to the priest who attended him, but his
spirit struggled forth from its fleshly coil before Absolution could be
given him. On that very night there began in Church-Peveril the haunting
which to this day is but seldom spoken of by the family, and then only
in low tones and with serious mien. For, only an hour or two after
handsome Dickâ€™s death, one of the servants passing the door of the long
gallery heard from within peals of the loud laughter so jovial and yet
so sinister, which he had thought would never be heard in the house
again. In a moment of that cold courage, which is so nearly akin to
mortal terror, he opened the door and entered, expecting to see he knew
not what manifestation of him who lay dead in the room below. Instead he
saw two little white-robed figures toddling towards him hand in hand
across the moon-lit floor.

The watchers in the room below ran upstairs startled by the crash of his
fallen body, and found him lying in the grip of some dread convulsion.
Just before morning he regained consciousness and told his tale. Then
pointing with trembling and ash-grey finger towards the door, he
screamed aloud, and so fell back dead.

       *       *       *       *       *

During the next fifty years this strange and terrible legend of the
twin-babies became fixed and consolidated. Their appearance, luckily for
those who inhabit the house, was exceedingly rare, and during these
years they seem to have been seen four or five times only. On each
occasion they appeared at night, between sunset and sunrise, always in
the same long gallery, and always as two toddling children scarcely able
to walk. And on each occasion the luckless individual who saw them died
either speedily or terribly, or with both speed and terror, after the
accursed vision had appeared to him. Sometimes he might live for a few
months: he was lucky if he died, as did the servant who first saw them,
in a few hours. Vastly more awful was the fate of a certain Mrs Canning,
who had the ill-luck to see them in the middle of the next century, or
to be quite accurate, in the year 1760. By this time the hours and the
place of their appearance were well-known, and, as up till a year ago,
visitors were warned not to go between sunset and sunrise into the long
gallery.

But Mrs Canning, a brilliantly clever and beautiful woman, admirer also
and friend of the notorious sceptic M. Voltaire, wilfully went and sat
night after night, in spite of all protestations, in the haunted place.
For four evenings she saw nothing, but on the fifth she had her will,
for the door in the middle of the gallery opened, and there came
toddling towards her the ill-omened innocent little pair. It seemed that
even then she was not frightened, but she thought good, poor wretch, to
mock at them, telling them it was time for them to get back into the
fire. They gave no word in answer, but turned away from her crying and
sobbing. Immediately after they disappeared from her vision and she
rustled downstairs to where the family and guests in the house were
waiting for her, with the triumphant announcement that she had seen them
both, and must needs write to M. Voltaire, saying that she had spoken to
spirits made manifest. It would make him laugh. But when some months
later the whole news reached him he did not laugh at all.

Mrs Canning was one of the great beauties of her day, and in the year
1760 she was at the height and zenith of her blossoming. The chief
beauty, if it is possible to single out one point where all was so
exquisite, lay in the dazzling colour and incomparable brilliance of her
complexion. She was now just thirty years of age, but, in spite of the
excesses of her life, retained the snow and roses of girlhood, and she
courted the bright light of day which other women shunned, for it but
showed to greater advantage the splendour of her skin. In consequence
she was very considerably dismayed one morning, about a fortnight after
her strange experience in the long gallery, to observe on her left cheek
an inch or two below her turquoise-coloured eyes, a little greyish patch
of skin, about as big as a threepenny piece. It was in vain that she
applied her accustomed washes and ungents: vain, too, were the arts of
her _fardeuse_ and of her medical adviser. For a week she kept herself
secluded, martyring herself with solitude and unaccustomed physics, and
for result at the end of the week she had no amelioration to comfort
herself with: instead this woeful grey patch had doubled itself in size.
Thereafter the nameless disease, whatever it was, developed in new and
terrible ways. From the centre of the discoloured place there sprouted
forth little lichen-like tendrils of greenish-grey, and another patch
appeared on her lower lip. This, too, soon vegetated, and one morning
on opening her eyes to the horror of a new day, she found that her
vision was strangely blurred. She sprang to her looking-glass, and what
she saw caused her to shriek aloud with horror. From under her upper
eye-lid a fresh growth had sprung up, mushroom-like, in the night, and
its filaments extended downwards, screening the pupil of her eye. Soon
after her tongue and throat were attacked: the air passages became
obstructed, and death by suffocation was merciful after such suffering.

More terrible yet was the case of a certain Colonel Blantyre who fired
at the children with his revolver. What he went through is not to be
recorded here.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is this haunting, then, that the Peverils take quite seriously, and
every guest on his arrival in the house is told that the long gallery
must not be entered after nightfall on any pretext whatever. By day,
however, it is a delightful room and intrinsically merits description,
apart from the fact that the due understanding of its geography is
necessary for the account that here follows. It is full eighty feet in
length, and is lit by a row of six tall windows looking over the gardens
at the back of the house. A door communicates with the landing at the
top of the main staircase, and about half-way down the gallery in the
wall facing the windows is another door communicating with the back
staircase and servantsâ€™ quarters, and thus the gallery forms a constant
place of passage for them in going to the rooms on the first landing. It
was through this door that the baby-figures came when they appeared to
Mrs Canning, and on several other occasions they have been known to make
their entry here, for the room out of which handsome Dick took them lies
just beyond at the top of the back stairs. Further on again in the
gallery is the fireplace into which he thrust them, and at the far end a
large bow-window looks straight down the avenue. Above this fireplace
there hangs with grim significance a portrait of handsome Dick, in the
insolent beauty of early manhood, attributed to Holbein, and a dozen
other portraits of great merit face the windows. During the day this is
the most frequented sitting-room in the house, for its other visitors
never appear there then, nor does it then ever resound with the harsh
jovial laugh of handsome Dick, which sometimes, after dark has fallen,
is heard by passers-by on the landing outside. But Blanche does not grow
bright-eyed when she hears it: she shuts her ears and hastens to put a
greater distance between her and the sound of that atrocious mirth.

But during the day the long gallery is frequented by many occupants, and
much laughter in no wise sinister or saturnine resounds there. When
summer lies hot over the land, those occupants lounge in the deep window
seats, and when winter spreads his icy fingers and blows shrilly between
his frozen palms, congregate round the fireplace at the far end, and
perch, in companies of cheerful chatterers, upon sofa and chair, and
chair-back and floor. Often have I sat there on long August evenings up
till dressing-time, but never have I been there when anyone has seemed
disposed to linger over-late without hearing the warning: â€œIt is close
on sunset: shall we go?â€ Later on in the shorter autumn days they often
have tea laid there, and sometimes it has happened that, even while
merriment was most uproarious, Mrs Peveril has suddenly looked out of
the window and said, â€œMy dears, it is getting so late: let us finish our
nonsense downstairs in the hall.â€ And then for a moment a curious hush
always falls on loquacious family and guests alike, and as if some bad
news had just been known, we all make our silent way out of the place.
But the spirits of the Peverils (of the living ones, that is to say) are
the most mercurial imaginable, and the blight which the thought of
handsome Dick and his doings casts over them passes away again with
amazing rapidity.

       *       *       *       *       *

A typical party, large, young, and peculiarly cheerful, was staying at
Church-Peveril shortly after Christmas last year, and as usual on
December 31, Mrs Peveril was giving her annual New Yearâ€™s Eve ball. The
house was quite full, and she had commandeered as well the greater part
of the Peveril Arms to provide sleeping-quarters for the overflow from
the house. For some days past a black and windless frost had stopped all
hunting, but it is an ill windlessness that blows no good (if so mixed a
metaphor may be forgiven), and the lake below the house had for the last
day or two been covered with an adequate and admirable sheet of ice.
Everyone in the house had been occupied all the morning of that day in
performing swift and violent manÅ“uvres on the elusive surface, and as
soon as lunch was over we all, with one exception, hurried out again.
This one exception was Madge Dalrymple who had had the misfortune to
fall rather badly earlier in the day, but hoped, by resting her injured
knee, instead of joining the skaters again, to be able to dance that
evening. The hope, it is true, was of the most sanguine sort, for she
could but hobble ignobly back to the house, but with the breezy optimism
which characterises the Peverils (she is Blancheâ€™s first cousin), she
remarked that it would be but tepid enjoyment that she could, in her
present state, derive from further skating, and thus she sacrificed
little, but might gain much.

Accordingly after a rapid cup of coffee which was served in the long
gallery, we left Madge comfortably reclined on the big sofa at
right-angles to the fireplace, with an attractive book to beguile the
tedium till tea. Being of the family, she knew all about handsome Dick
and the babies, and the fate of Mrs Canning and Colonel Blantyre, but as
we went out I heard Blanche say to her, â€œDonâ€™t run it too fine, dear,â€
and Madge had replied, â€œNo; Iâ€™ll go away well before sunset.â€ And so we
left her alone in the long gallery.

       *       *       *       *       *

Madge read her attractive book for some minutes, but failing to get
absorbed in it, put it down and limped across to the window. Though it
was still but little after two, it was but a dim and uncertain light
that entered, for the crystalline brightness of the morning had given
place to a veiled obscurity produced by flocks of thick clouds which
were coming sluggishly up from the north-east. Already the whole sky was
overcast with them, and occasionally a few snowflakes fluttered
waveringly down past the long windows. From the darkness and bitter cold
of the afternoon, it seemed to her that there was like to be a heavy
snowfall before long, and these outward signs were echoed inwardly in
her by that muffled drowsiness of the brain, which to those who are
sensitive to the pressures and lightnesses of weather portends storm.
Madge was peculiarly the prey of such external influences: to her a
brisk morning gave an ineffable brightness and briskness of spirit, and
correspondingly the approach of heavy weather produced a somnolence in
sensation that both drowsed and depressed her.

It was in such mood as this that she limped back again to the sofa
beside the log-fire. The whole house was comfortably heated by
water-pipes, and though the fire of logs and peat, an adorable mixture,
had been allowed to burn low, the room was very warm. Idly she watched
the dwindling flames, not opening her book again, but lying on the sofa
with face towards the fireplace, intending drowsily and not immediately
to go to her own room and spend the hours, until the return of the
skaters made gaiety in the house again, in writing one or two neglected
letters. Still drowsily she began thinking over what she had to
communicate: one letter several days overdue should go to her mother,
who was immensely interested in the psychical affairs of the family. She
would tell her how Master Anthony had been prodigiously active on the
staircase a night or two ago, and how the Blue Lady, regardless of the
severity of the weather, had been seen by Mrs Peveril that morning,
strolling about. It was rather interesting: the Blue Lady had gone down
the laurel walk and had been seen by her to enter the stables, where, at
the moment, Freddy Peveril was inspecting the frost-bound hunters.
Identically then, a sudden panic had spread through the stables, and the
horses had whinnied and kicked, and shied, and sweated. Of the fatal
twins nothing had been seen for many years past, but, as her mother
knew, the Peverils never used the long gallery after dark.

Then for a moment she sat up, remembering that she was in the long
gallery now. But it was still but a little after half-past two, and if
she went to her room in half an hour, she would have ample time to
write this and another letter before tea. Till then she would read her
book. But she found she had left it on the window-sill, and it seemed
scarcely worth while to get it. She felt exceedingly drowsy.

The sofa where she lay had been lately re-covered, in a greyish green
shade of velvet, somewhat the colour of lichen. It was of very thick
soft texture, and she luxuriously stretched her arms out, one on each
side of her body, and pressed her fingers into the nap. How horrible
that story of Mrs Canning was: the growth on her face was of the colour
of lichen. And then without further transition or blurring of thought
Madge fell asleep.

She dreamed. She dreamed that she awoke and found herself exactly where
she had gone to sleep, and in exactly the same attitude. The flames from
the logs had burned up again, and leaped on the walls, fitfully
illuminating the picture of handsome Dick above the fire-place. In her
dream she knew exactly what she had done to-day, and for what reason she
was lying here now instead of being out with the rest of the skaters.
She remembered also (still dreaming), that she was going to write a
letter or two before tea, and prepared to get up in order to go to her
room. As she half-rose she caught sight of her own arms lying out on
each side of her on the grey velvet sofa. But she could not see where
her hands ended, and where the grey velvet began: her fingers seemed to
have melted into the stuff. She could see her wrists quite clearly, and
a blue vein on the backs of her hands, and here and there a knuckle.
Then, in her dream she remembered, the last thought which had been in
her mind before she fell asleep, namely the growth of the
lichen-coloured vegetation on the face and the eyes and the throat of
Mrs Canning. At that thought the strangling terror of real nightmare
began: she knew that she was being transformed into this grey stuff, and
she was absolutely unable to move. Soon the grey would spread up her
arms, and over her feet; when they came in from skating they would find
here nothing but a huge misshapen cushion of lichen-coloured velvet, and
that would be she. The horror grew more acute, and then by a violent
effort she shook herself free of the clutches of this very evil dream,
and she awoke.

For a minute or two she lay there, conscious only of the tremendous
relief at finding herself awake. She felt again with her fingers the
pleasant touch of the velvet, and drew them backwards and forwards,
assuring herself that she was not, as her dream had suggested, melting
into greyness and softness. But she was still, in spite of the violence
of her awakening, very sleepy, and lay there till, looking down, she was
aware that she could not see her hands at all. It was very nearly dark.

At that moment a sudden flicker of flame came from the dying fire, and a
flare of burning gas from the peat flooded the room. The portrait of
handsome Dick looked evilly down on her, and her hands were visible
again. And then a panic worse than the panic of her dreams seized her.
Daylight had altogether faded, and she knew that she was alone in the
dark in the terrible gallery. This panic was of the nature of nightmare,
for she felt unable to move for terror. But it was worse than nightmare
because she knew she was awake. And then the full cause of this frozen
fear dawned on her; she knew with the certainty of absolute conviction
that she was about to see the twin-babies.

She felt a sudden moisture break out on her face, and within her mouth
her tongue and throat went suddenly dry, and she felt her tongue grate
along the inner surface of her teeth. All power of movement had slipped
from her limbs, leaving them dead and inert, and she stared with wide
eyes into the blackness. The spurt of flame from the peat had burned
itself out again, and darkness encompassed her.

Then on the wall opposite her, facing the windows, there grew a faint
light of dusky crimson. For a moment she thought it but heralded the
approach of the awful vision, then hope revived in her heart, and she
remembered that thick clouds had overcast the sky before she went to
sleep, and guessed that this light came from the sun not yet quite sunk
and set. This sudden revival of hope gave her the necessary stimulus,
and she sprang off the sofa where she lay. She looked out of the window
and saw the dull glow on the horizon. But before she could take a step
forward it was obscured again. A tiny sparkle of light came from the
hearth which did no more than illuminate the tiles of the fireplace, and
snow falling heavily tapped at the window panes. There was neither light
nor sound except these.

But the courage that had come to her, giving her the power of movement,
had not quite deserted her, and she began feeling her way down the
gallery. And then she found that she was lost. She stumbled against a
chair, and, recovering herself, stumbled against another. Then a table
barred her way, and, turning swiftly aside, she found herself up against
the back of a sofa. Once more she turned and saw the dim gleam of the
firelight on the side opposite to that on which she expected it. In her
blind gropings she must have reversed her direction. But which way was
she to go now? She seemed blocked in by furniture. And all the time
insistent and imminent was the fact that the two innocent terrible
ghosts were about to appear to her.

Then she began to pray, â€œLighten our darkness, O Lord,â€ she said to
herself. But she could not remember how the prayer continued, and she
had sore need of it. There was something about the perils of the night.
All this time she felt about her with groping, fluttering hands. The
fire-glimmer which should have been on her left was on her right again;
therefore she must turn herself round again. â€œLighten our darkness,â€ she
whispered, and then aloud she repeated, â€œLighten our darkness.â€

She stumbled up against a screen, and could not remember the existence
of any such screen. Hastily she felt beside it with blind hands, and
touched something soft and velvety. Was it the sofa on which she had
lain? If so, where was the head of it. It had a head and a back and
feet--it was like a person, all covered with grey lichen. Then she lost
her head completely. All that remained to her was to pray; she was lost,
lost in this awful place, where no one came in the dark except the
babies that cried. And she heard her voice rising from whisper to
speech, and speech to scream. She shrieked out the holy words, she
yelled them as if blaspheming as she groped among tables and chairs and
the pleasant things of ordinary life which had become so terrible.

       *       *       *       *       *

Then came a sudden and an awful answer to her screamed prayer. Once more
a pocket of inflammable gas in the peat on the hearth was reached by the
smouldering embers, and the room started into light. She saw the evil
eyes of handsome Dick, she saw the little ghostly snow-flakes falling
thickly outside. And she saw where she was, just opposite the door
through which the terrible twins made their entrance. Then the flame
went out again, and left her in blackness once more. But she had gained
something, for she had her geography now. The centre of the room was
bare of furniture, and one swift dart would take her to the door of the
landing above the main staircase and into safety. In that gleam she had
been able to see the handle of the door, bright-brassed, luminous like a
star. She would go straight for it; it was but a matter of a few seconds
now.

She took a long breath, partly of relief, partly to satisfy the demands
of her galloping heart. But the breath was only half-taken when she was
stricken once more into the immobility of nightmare.

There came a little whisper, it was no more than that, from the door
opposite which she stood, and through which the twin-babies entered. It
was not quite dark outside it, for she could see that the door was
opening. And there stood in the opening two little white figures, side
by side. They came towards her slowly, shufflingly. She could not see
face or form at all distinctly, but the two little white figures were
advancing. She knew them to be the ghosts of terror, innocent of the
awful doom they were bound to bring, even as she was innocent. With the
inconceivable rapidity of thought, she made up her mind what to do. She
had not hurt them or laughed at them, and they, they were but babies
when the wicked and bloody deed had sent them to their burning death.
Surely the spirits of these children would not be inaccessible to the
cry of one who was of the same blood as they, who had committed no fault
that merited the doom they brought. If she entreated them they might
have mercy, they might forebear to bring the curse on her, they might
allow her to pass out of the place without blight, without the sentence
of death, or the shadow of things worse than death upon her.

It was but for the space of a moment that she hesitated, then she sank
down on to her knees, and stretched out her hands towards them.

â€œOh, my dears,â€ she said, â€œI only fell asleep. I have done no more wrong
than that----â€

She paused a moment, and her tender girlâ€™s heart thought no more of
herself, but only of them, those little innocent spirits on whom so
awful a doom was laid, that they should bring death where other children
bring laughter, and doom for delight. But all those who had seen them
before had dreaded and feared them, or had mocked at them.

Then, as the enlightenment of pity dawned on her, her fear fell from her
like the wrinkled sheath that holds the sweet folded buds of Spring.

â€œDears, I am so sorry for you,â€ she said. â€œIt is not your fault that you
must bring me what you must bring, but I am not afraid any longer. I am
only sorry for you. God bless you, you poor darlings.â€

She raised her head and looked at them. Though it was so dark, she could
now see their faces, though all was dim and wavering, like the light of
pale flames shaken by a draught. But the faces were not miserable or
fierce--they smiled at her with shy little baby smiles. And as she
looked they grew faint, fading slowly away like wreaths of vapour in
frosty air.

       *       *       *       *       *

Madge did not at once move when they had vanished, for instead of fear
there was wrapped round her a wonderful sense of peace, so happy and
serene that she would not willingly stir, and so perhaps disturb it. But
before long she got up, and feeling her way, but without any sense of
nightmare pressing her on, or frenzy of fear to spur her, she went out
of the long gallery, to find Blanche just coming upstairs whistling and
swinging her skates.

â€œHowâ€™s the leg, dear,â€ she asked, â€œYouâ€™re not limping any more.â€

Till that moment Madge had not thought of it.

â€œI think it must be all right,â€ she said, â€œI had forgotten it anyhow.
Blanche, dear, you wonâ€™t be frightened for me, will you, but--but I have
seen the twins.â€

For a moment Blancheâ€™s face whitened with terror.

â€œWhat?â€ she said in a whisper.

â€œYes, I saw them just now. But they were kind, they smiled at me, and I
was so sorry for them. And somehow I am sure I have nothing to fear.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

It seems that Madge was right, for nothing untoward has come to her.
Something, her attitude to them, we must suppose, her pity, her
sympathy, touched and dissolved and annihilated the curse. Indeed, I was
at Church Peveril only last week, arriving there after dark. Just as I
passed the gallery door, Blanche came out.

â€œAh, there you are,â€ she said, â€œIâ€™ve just been seeing the twins. They
looked too sweet and stopped nearly ten minutes. Let us have tea at
once.â€




CATERPILLARS


I saw a month or two ago in an Italian paper that the Villa Cascana, in
which I once stayed, had been pulled down, and that a manufactory of
some sort was in process of erection on its site. There is therefore no
longer any reason for refraining from writing of those things which I
myself saw (or imagined I saw) in a certain room and on a certain
landing of the villa in question, nor from mentioning the circumstances
which followed, which may or may not (according to the opinion of the
reader) throw some light on or be somehow connected with this
experience.

The Villa Cascana was in all ways but one a perfectly delightful house,
yet, if it were standing now, nothing in the world--I use the phrase in
its literal sense--would induce me to set foot in it again, for I
believe it to have been haunted in a very terrible and practical manner.
Most ghosts, when all is said and done, do not do much harm; they may
perhaps terrify, but the person whom they visit usually gets over their
visitation. They may on the other hand be entirely friendly and
beneficent. But the appearances in the Villa Cascana were not
beneficent, and had they made their â€œvisitâ€ in a very slightly
different manner, I do not suppose I should have got over it any more
than Arthur Inglis did.

       *       *       *       *       *

The house stood on an ilex-clad hill not far from Sestri di Levante on
the Italian Riviera, looking out over the iridescent blues of that
enchanted sea, while behind it rose the pale green chestnut woods that
climb up the hillsides till they give place to the pines that, black in
contrast with them, crown the slopes. All round it the garden in the
luxuriance of mid-spring bloomed and was fragrant, and the scent of
magnolia and rose, borne on the salt freshness of the winds from the
sea, flowed like a stream through the cool vaulted rooms.

On the ground floor a broad pillared _loggia_ ran round three sides of
the house, the top of which formed a balcony for certain rooms of the
first floor. The main staircase, broad and of grey marble steps, led up
from the hall to the landing outside these rooms, which were three in
number, namely two big sitting-rooms and a bedroom arranged _en suite_.
The latter was unoccupied, the sitting-rooms were in use. From these the
main staircase was continued to the second floor, where were situated
certain bedrooms, one of which I occupied, while from the other side of
the first-floor landing some half-dozen steps led to another suite of
rooms, where, at the time I am speaking of, Arthur Inglis, the artist,
had his bedroom and studio. Thus the landing outside my bedroom at the
top of the house, commanded both the landing of the first floor, and
also the steps that led to Inglisâ€™ rooms. Jim Stanley and his wife,
finally (whose guest I was), occupied rooms in another wing of the
house, where also were the servantsâ€™ quarters.

I arrived just in time for lunch on a brilliant noon of mid-May. The
garden was shouting with colour and fragrance, and not less delightful
after my broiling walk up from the _marina_, should have been the coming
from the reverberating heat and blaze of the day into the marble
coolness of the villa. Only (the reader has my bare word for this, and
nothing more), the moment I set foot in the house I felt that something
was wrong. This feeling, I may say, was quite vague, though very strong,
and I remember that when I saw letters waiting for me on the table in
the hall I felt certain that the explanation was here: I was convinced
that there was bad news of some sort for me. Yet when I opened them I
found no such explanation of my premonition: my correspondents all
reeked of prosperity. Yet this clear miscarriage of a presentiment did
not dissipate my uneasiness. In that cool fragrant house there was
something wrong.

I am at pains to mention this because to the general view it may explain
that though I am as a rule so excellent a sleeper that the extinction of
my light on getting into bed is apparently contemporaneous with being
called on the following morning, I slept very badly on my first night
in the Villa Cascana. It may also explain the fact that when I did sleep
(if it was indeed in sleep that I saw what I thought I saw) I dreamed in
a very vivid and original manner, original, that is to say, in the sense
that something that, as far as I knew, had never previously entered into
my consciousness, usurped it then. But since, in addition to this evil
premonition, certain words and events occurring during the rest of the
day, might have suggested something of what I thought happened that
night, it will be well to relate them.

After lunch, then, I went round the house with Mrs Stanley, and during
our tour she referred, it is true, to the unoccupied bedroom on the
first floor, which opened out of the room where we had lunched.

â€œWe left that unoccupied,â€ she said, â€œbecause Jim and I have a charming
bedroom and dressing-room, as you saw, in the wing, and if we used it
ourselves we should have to turn the dining-room into a dressing-room
and have our meals downstairs. As it is, however, we have our little
flat there, Arthur Inglis has his little flat in the other passage; and
I remembered (arenâ€™t I extraordinary?) that you once said that the
higher up you were in a house the better you were pleased. So I put you
at the top of the house, instead of giving you that room.â€

It is true, that a doubt, vague as my uneasy premonition, crossed my
mind at this. I did not see why Mrs Stanley should have explained all
this, if there had not been more to explain. I allow, therefore, that
the thought that there was something to explain about the unoccupied
bedroom was momentarily present to my mind.

The second thing that may have borne on my dream was this.

At dinner the conversation turned for a moment on ghosts. Inglis, with
the certainty of conviction, expressed his belief that anybody who could
possibly believe in the existence of supernatural phenomena was unworthy
of the name of an ass. The subject instantly dropped. As far as I can
recollect, nothing else occurred or was said that could bear on what
follows.

We all went to bed rather early, and personally I yawned my way
upstairs, feeling hideously sleepy. My room was rather hot, and I threw
all the windows wide, and from without poured in the white light of the
moon, and the love-song of many nightingales. I undressed quickly, and
got into bed, but though I had felt so sleepy before, I now felt
extremely wide-awake. But I was quite content to be awake: I did not
toss or turn, I felt perfectly happy listening to the song and seeing
the light. Then, it is possible, I may have gone to sleep, and what
follows may have been a dream. I thought anyhow that after a time the
nightingales ceased singing and the moon sank. I thought also that if,
for some unexplained reason, I was going to lie awake all night, I might
as well read, and I remembered that I had left a book in which I was
interested in the dining-room on the first floor. So I got out of bed,
lit a candle, and went downstairs. I went into the room, saw on a
side-table the book I had come to look for, and then, simultaneously,
saw that the door into the unoccupied bedroom was open. A curious grey
light, not of dawn nor of moonshine, came out of it, and I looked in.
The bed stood just opposite the door, a big four-poster, hung with
tapestry at the head. Then I saw that the greyish light of the bedroom
came from the bed, or rather from what was on the bed. For it was
covered with great caterpillars, a foot or more in length, which crawled
over it. They were faintly luminous, and it was the light from them that
showed me the room. Instead of the sucker-feet of ordinary caterpillars
they had rows of pincers like crabs, and they moved by grasping what
they lay on with their pincers, and then sliding their bodies forward.
In colour these dreadful insects were yellowish-grey, and they were
covered with irregular lumps and swellings. There must have been
hundreds of them, for they formed a sort of writhing, crawling pyramid
on the bed. Occasionally one fell off on to the floor, with a soft
fleshy thud, and though the floor was of hard concrete, it yielded to
the pincer-feet as if it had been putty, and, crawling back, the
caterpillar would mount on to the bed again, to rejoin its fearful
companions. They appeared to have no faces, so to speak, but at one end
of them there was a mouth that opened sideways in respiration.

Then, as I looked, it seemed to me as if they all suddenly became
conscious of my presence. All the mouths at any rate were turned in my
direction, and next moment they began dropping off the bed with those
soft fleshy thuds on to the floor, and wriggling towards me. For one
second a paralysis as of a dream was on me, but the next I was running
upstairs again to my room, and I remember feeling the cold of the marble
steps on my bare feet. I rushed into my bedroom, and slammed the door
behind me, and then--I was certainly wide awake now--I found myself
standing by my bed with the sweat of terror pouring from me. The noise
of the banged door still rang in my ears. But, as would have been more
usual, if this had been mere nightmare, the terror that had been mine
when I saw those foul beasts crawling about the bed or dropping softly
on to the floor did not cease then. Awake now, if dreaming before, I did
not at all recover from the horror of dream: it did not seem to me that
I had dreamed. And until dawn, I sat or stood, not daring to lie down,
thinking that every rustle or movement that I heard was the approach of
the caterpillars. To them and the claws that bit into the cement the
wood of the door was childâ€™s play: steel would not keep them out.

But with the sweet and noble return of day the horror vanished: the
whisper of wind became benignant again: the nameless fear, whatever it
was, was smoothed out and terrified me no longer. Dawn broke, hueless at
first; then it grew dove-coloured, then the flaming pageant of light
spread over the sky.

       *       *       *       *       *

The admirable rule of the house was that everybody had breakfast where
and when he pleased, and in consequence it was not till lunch-time that
I met any of the other members of our party, since I had breakfast on my
balcony, and wrote letters and other things till lunch. In fact, I got
down to that meal rather late, after the other three had begun. Between
my knife and fork there was a small pill-box of cardboard, and as I sat
down Inglis spoke.

â€œDo look at that,â€ he said, â€œsince you are interested in natural
history. I found it crawling on my counterpane last night, and I donâ€™t
know what it is.â€

I think that before I opened the pill-box I expected something of the
sort which I found in it. Inside it, anyhow, was a small caterpillar,
greyish-yellow in colour, with curious bumps and excrescences on its
rings. It was extremely active, and hurried round the box, this way and
that. Its feet were unlike the feet of any caterpillar I ever saw: they
were like the pincers of a crab. I looked, and shut the lid down again.

â€œNo, I donâ€™t know it,â€ I said, â€œbut it looks rather unwholesome. What
are you going to do with it?â€

â€œOh, I shall keep it,â€ said Inglis. â€œIt has begun to spin: I want to see
what sort of a moth it turns into.â€

I opened the box again, and saw that these hurrying movements were
indeed the beginning of the spinning of the web of its cocoon. Then
Inglis spoke again.

â€œIt has got funny feet, too,â€ he said. â€œThey are like crabsâ€™ pincers.
Whatâ€™s the Latin for crab? Oh, yes, Cancer. So in case it is unique,
letâ€™s christen it: â€˜Cancer Inglisensis.â€™â€

Then something happened in my brain, some momentary piecing together of
all that I had seen or dreamed. Something in his words seemed to me to
throw light on it all, and my own intense horror at the experience of
the night before linked itself on to what he had just said. In effect, I
took the box and threw it, caterpillar and all, out of the window. There
was a gravel path just outside, and beyond it, a fountain playing into a
basin. The box fell on to the middle of this.

Inglis laughed.

â€œSo the students of the occult donâ€™t like solid facts,â€ he said. â€œMy
poor caterpillar!â€

The talk went off again at once on to other subjects, and I have only
given in detail, as they happened, these trivialities in order to be
sure myself that I have recorded everything that could have borne on
occult subjects or on the subject of caterpillars. But at the moment
when I threw the pill-box into the fountain, I lost my head: my only
excuse is that, as is probably plain, the tenant of it was, in
miniature, exactly what I had seen crowded on to the bed in the
unoccupied room. And though this translation of those phantoms into
flesh and blood--or whatever it is that caterpillars are made of--ought
perhaps to have relieved the horror of the night, as a matter of fact it
did nothing of the kind. It only made the crawling pyramid that covered
the bed in the unoccupied room more hideously real.

       *       *       *       *       *

After lunch we spent a lazy hour or two strolling about the garden or
sitting in the loggia, and it must have been about four oâ€™clock when
Stanley and I started off to bathe, down the path that led by the
fountain into which I had thrown the pill-box. The water was shallow and
clear, and at the bottom of it I saw its white remains. The water had
disintegrated the cardboard, and it had become no more than a few strips
and shreds of sodden paper. The centre of the fountain was a marble
Italian Cupid which squirted the water out of a wine-skin held under its
arm. And crawling up its leg was the caterpillar. Strange and scarcely
credible as it seemed, it must have survived the falling-to-bits of its
prison, and made its way to shore, and there it was, out of armâ€™s reach,
weaving and waving this way and that as it evolved its cocoon.

Then, as I looked at it, it seemed to me again that, like the
caterpillar I had seen last night, it saw me, and breaking out of the
threads that surrounded it, it crawled down the marble leg of the Cupid
and began swimming like a snake across the water of the fountain towards
me. It came with extraordinary speed (the fact of a caterpillar being
able to swim was new to me), and in another moment was crawling up the
marble lip of the basin. Just then Inglis joined us.

â€œWhy, if it isnâ€™t old â€˜Cancer Inglisensisâ€™ again,â€ he said, catching
sight of the beast. â€œWhat a tearing hurry it is in.â€

We were standing side by side on the path, and when the caterpillar had
advanced to within about a yard of us, it stopped, and began waving
again, as if in doubt as to the direction in which it should go. Then it
appeared to make up its mind, and crawled on to Inglisâ€™ shoe.

â€œIt likes me best,â€ he said, â€œbut I donâ€™t really know that I like it.
And as it wonâ€™t drown I think perhaps----â€

He shook it off his shoe on to the gravel path and trod on it.

       *       *       *       *       *

All afternoon the air got heavier and heavier with the Sirocco that was
without doubt coming up from the south, and that night again I went up
to bed feeling very sleepy; but below my drowsiness, so to speak, there
was the consciousness, stronger than before, that there was something
wrong in the house, that something dangerous was close at hand. But I
fell asleep at once, and--how long after I do not know--either woke or
dreamed I awoke, feeling that I must get up at once, _or I should be too
late_. Then (dreaming or awake) I lay and fought this fear, telling
myself that I was but the prey of my own nerves disordered by Sirocco or
what not, and at the same time quite clearly knowing in another part of
my mind, so to speak, that every momentâ€™s delay added to the danger. At
last this second feeling became irresistible, and I put on coat and
trousers and went out of my room on to the landing. And then I saw that
I had already delayed too long, and that I was now too late.

The whole of the landing of the first floor below was invisible under
the swarm of caterpillars that crawled there. The folding doors into the
sitting-room from which opened the bedroom where I had seen them last
night, were shut, but they were squeezing through the cracks of it, and
dropping one by one through the keyhole, elongating themselves into mere
string as they passed, and growing fat and lumpy again on emerging.
Some, as if exploring, were nosing about the steps into the passage at
the end of which were Inglisâ€™ rooms, others were crawling on the lowest
steps of the staircase that led up to where I stood. The landing,
however, was completely covered with them: I was cut off. And of the
frozen horror that seized me when I saw that, I can give no idea in
words.

       *       *       *       *       *

Then at last a general movement began to take place, and they grew
thicker on the steps that led to Inglisâ€™ room. Gradually, like some
hideous tide of flesh, they advanced along the passage, and I saw the
foremost, visible by the pale grey luminousness that came from them,
reach his door. Again and again I tried to shout and warn him, in terror
all the time that they would turn at the sound of my voice and mount my
stair instead, but for all my efforts I felt that no sound came from my
throat. They crawled along the hinge-crack of his door, passing through
as they had done before, and still I stood there making impotent efforts
to shout to him, to bid him escape while there was time.

       *       *       *       *       *

At last the passage was completely empty: they had all gone, and at that
moment I was conscious for the first time of the cold of the marble
landing on which I stood barefooted. The dawn was just beginning to
break in the Eastern sky.

       *       *       *       *       *

Six months later I met Mrs Stanley in a country house in England. We
talked on many subjects and at last she said:

â€œI donâ€™t think I have seen you since I got that dreadful news about
Arthur Inglis a month ago.â€

â€œI havenâ€™t heard,â€ said I.

â€œNo? He has got cancer. They donâ€™t even advise an operation, for there
is no hope of a cure: he is riddled with it, the doctors say.â€

Now during all these six months I do not think a day had passed on which
I had not had in my mind the dreams (or whatever you like to call them)
which I had seen in the Villa Cascana.

â€œIt is awful, is it not?â€ she continued, â€œand I feel, I canâ€™t help
feeling, that he may have----â€

â€œCaught it at the villa?â€ I asked.

She looked at me in blank surprise.

â€œWhy did you say that?â€ she asked. â€œHow did you know?â€

Then she told me. In the unoccupied bedroom a year before there had been
a fatal case of cancer. She had, of course, taken the best advice and
had been told that the utmost dictates of prudence would be obeyed so
long as she did not put anybody to sleep in the room, which had also
been thoroughly disinfected and newly white-washed and painted. But----




THE CAT


Many people will, doubtless, remember that exhibition at the Royal
Academy, not so many seasons ago, which came to be known as Alinghamâ€™s
year, when Dick Alingham vaulted, with one bound, as it were, out of the
crowd of strugglers and seated himself with admirably certain poise on
the very topmost pinnacle of contemporary fame. He exhibited three
portraits, each a master-piece, which killed every picture within range.
But since that year nobody cared anything for pictures whether in or out
of range except those three, it did not signify so greatly. The
phenomenon of his appearance was as sudden as that of the meteor, coming
from nowhere and sliding large and luminous across the remote and
star-sown sky, as inexplicable as the bursting of a spring on some
dust-ridden rocky hillside. Some fairy godmother, one might conjecture,
had bethought herself of her forgotten godson, and with a wave of her
wand bestowed on him this transcendant gift. But, as the Irish say, she
held her wand in her left hand, for her gift had another side to it. Or
perhaps, again, Jim Merwick is right, and the theory he propounds in his
monograph, â€œOn certain obscure lesions of the nerve centres,â€ says the
final word on the subject.

Dick Alingham himself, as was indeed natural, was delighted with his
fairy godmother or his obscure lesion (whichever was responsible), and
(the monograph spoken of above was written after Dickâ€™s death) confessed
frankly to his friend Merwick, who was still struggling through the
crowd of rising young medical practitioners, that it was all quite as
inexplicable to himself as it was to anyone else.

â€œAll I know about it,â€ he said, â€œis that last autumn I went through two
months of mental depression so hideous that I thought again and again
that I must go off my head. For hours daily, I sat here, waiting for
something to crack, which as far as I am concerned would end everything.
Yes, there was a cause; you know it.â€

He paused a moment and poured into his glass a fairly liberal allowance
of whisky, filled it half up from a syphon, and lit a cigarette. The
cause, indeed, had no need to be enlarged on, for Merwick quite well
remembered how the girl Dick had been engaged to, threw him over with an
abruptness that was almost superb, when a more eligible suitor made his
appearance. The latter was certainly very eligible indeed with his
good looks, his title, and his million of money, and Lady
Madingley--ex-future Mrs Alingham--was perfectly content with what she
had done. She was one of those blonde, lithe, silken girls who, happily
for the peace of menâ€™s minds, are rather rare, and who remind one of
some humanised yet celestial and bestial cat.

â€œI neednâ€™t speak of the cause,â€ Dick continued, â€œbut, as I say, for
those two months I soberly thought that the only end to it would be
madness. Then one evening when I was sitting here alone--I was always
sitting alone--something did snap in my head. I know I wondered, without
caring at all, whether this was the madness which I had been expecting,
or whether (which would be preferable) some more fatal breakage had
happened. And even while I wondered, I was aware that I was not
depressed or unhappy any longer.â€

He paused for so long in a smiling retrospect that Merwick indicated to
him that he had a listener.

â€œWell?â€ he said.

â€œIt was well indeed. I havenâ€™t been unhappy since. I have been riotously
happy instead. Some divine doctor, I suppose, just wiped off that stain
on my brain that hurt so. Heavens, how it hurt! Have a drink, by the
way?â€

â€œNo, thanks,â€ said Merwick. â€œBut what has all this got to do with your
painting?â€

â€œWhy, everything. For I had hardly realised the fact that I was happy
again, when I was aware that everything looked different. The colours of
all I saw were twice as vivid as they had been, shape and outline were
intensified too. The whole visible world had been dusty and blurred
before, and seen in a half light. But now the lights were turned up, and
there was a new heaven and a new earth. And in the same flash, I knew
that I could paint things as I saw them. Which,â€ he concluded, â€œI have
done.â€

There was something rather sublime about this, and Merwick laughed.

â€œI wish something would snap in my brain, if it kindles the perceptions
in that way,â€ said he, â€œbut it is just possible that the snapping of
things in oneâ€™s brain does not always produce just that effect.â€

â€œThat is possible. Also, as I gather, things donâ€™t snap unless you have
gone through some such hideous period as I have been through. And I tell
you frankly that I wouldnâ€™t go through that again even to ensure a snap
that would make me see things like Titian.â€

â€œWhat did the snapping feel like?â€ asked Merwick.

Dick considered a moment.

â€œDo you know when a parcel comes, tied up with string, and you canâ€™t
find a knife,â€ he said, â€œand therefore you burn the string through,
holding it taut? Well, it was like that: quite painless, only something
got weaker and weaker, and then parted, softly without effort. Not very
lucid, Iâ€™m afraid, but it was just like that. It had been burning a
couple of months, you see.â€

He turned away and hunted among the letters and papers which littered
his writing-table till he found an envelope with a coronet on it. He
chuckled to himself as he took it up.

â€œCommend me to Lady Madingley,â€ he said, â€œfor a brazen impudence in
comparison with which brass is softer than putty. She wrote to me
yesterday, asking me if I would finish the portrait I had begun of her
last year, and let her have it at my own price.â€

â€œThen I think you have had a lucky escape,â€ remarked Merwick, â€œI suppose
you didnâ€™t even answer her.â€

â€œOh, yes, I did: why not? I said the price would be two thousand pounds,
and I was ready to go on at once. She has agreed, and sent me a cheque
for a thousand this evening.â€

Merwick stared at him in blank astonishment. â€œAre you mad?â€ he asked.

â€œI hope not, though one can never be sure about little points like that.
Even doctors like you donâ€™t know exactly what constitutes madness.â€

Merwick got up.

â€œBut is it possible that you donâ€™t see what a terrible risk you run?â€ he
asked. â€œTo see her again, to be with her like that, having to look at
her--I saw her this afternoon by the way, hardly human--may not that so
easily revive again all that you felt before? It is too dangerous: much
too dangerous.â€

Dick shook his head.

â€œThere is not the slightest risk,â€ he said, â€œeverything within me is
utterly and absolutely indifferent to her. I donâ€™t even hate her: if I
hated her there might be a possibility of my again loving her. As it is,
the thought of her does not arouse in me any emotion of any kind. And
really such stupendous calmness deserves to be rewarded. I respect
colossal things like that.â€

He finished his whisky as he spoke, and instantly poured himself out
another glass.

â€œThatâ€™s the fourth,â€ said his friend.

â€œIs it? I never count. It shows a sordid attention to uninteresting
detail. Funnily enough too, alcohol does not have the smallest effect on
me now.â€

â€œWhy drink then?â€

â€œBecause if I give it up this entrancing vividness of colour and clarity
of outline is a little diminished.â€

â€œCanâ€™t be good for you,â€ said the doctor.

Dick laughed.

â€œMy dear fellow, look at me carefully,â€ he said, â€œand then if you can
conscientiously declare that I show any signs of indulging in
stimulants, Iâ€™ll give them up altogether.â€

Certainly it would have been hard to find a point in which Dick did not
present the appearance of perfect health. He had paused, and stood still
a moment, his glass in one hand, the whisky-bottle in the other, black
against the front of his shirt, and not a tremor of unsteadiness was
there. His face of wholesome sun-burnt hue was neither puffy nor
emaciated, but firm of flesh and of a wonderful clearness of skin. Clear
too was his eye, with eyelids neither baggy nor puckered; he looked
indeed a model of condition, hard and fit, as if he was in training for
some athletic event. Lithe and active too was his figure, his movements
were quick and precise, and even Merwick, with his doctorâ€™s eye, trained
to detect any symptom, however slight, in which the drinker must betray
himself, was bound to confess that no such was here present. His
appearance contradicted it authoritatively, so also did his manner; he
met the eye of the man he was talking to without sideway glances; he
showed no signs however small, of any disorder of the nerves. Yet Dick
was altogether an abnormal fellow; the history he had just been
recounting was abnormal, those weeks of depression, followed by the
sudden snap in his brain which had apparently removed, as a wet cloth
removes a stain, all the memory of his love, and of the cruel bitterness
that resulted from it. Abnormal too was his sudden leap into high
artistic achievement from a past of very mediocre performance. Why
should there then not be a similar abnormality here?

â€œYes, I confess you show no sign of taking excessive stimulant,â€ said
Merwick, â€œbut if I attended you professionally--ah, Iâ€™m not touting--I
should make you give up all stimulant, and go to bed for a month.â€

â€œWhy in the name of goodness?â€ asked Dick.

â€œBecause, theoretically, it must be the best thing you could do. You had
a shock, how severe, the misery of those weeks of depression tells you.
Well, common-sense says, â€˜Go slow after a shock; recoup.â€™ Instead of
which you go very fast indeed and produce. I grant it seems to suit you;
you also became suddenly capable of feats which--oh, itâ€™s sheer
nonsense, man.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s sheer nonsense?â€

â€œYou are. Professionally, I detest you, because you appear to be an
exception to a theory that I am sure must be right. Therefore I have got
to explain you away, and at present I canâ€™t.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the theory?â€ asked Dick.

â€œWell, the treatment of shock first of all. And secondly, that in order
to do good work, one ought to eat and drink very little and sleep a lot.
How long do you sleep by the way?â€

Dick considered.

â€œOh, I go to bed about three usually,â€ he said; â€œI suppose I sleep for
about four hours.â€

â€œAnd live on whisky, and eat like a Strasburg goose, and are prepared to
run a race to-morrow. Go away, or at least I will. Perhaps youâ€™ll break
down, though. That would satisfy me. But even if you donâ€™t, it still
remains quite interesting.â€

Merwick found it more than quite interesting in fact, and when he got
home that night he searched in his shelves for a certain dusky volume in
which he turned up a chapter called â€œShock.â€ The book was a treatise on
obscure diseases and abnormal conditions of the nervous system. He had
often read it before, for in his profession he was a special student of
the rare and curious. And the following paragraph which had interested
him much before, interested him more than ever this evening.

â€œThe nervous system also can act in a way that must always even to the
most advanced student be totally unexpected. Cases are known, and
well-authenticated ones, when a paralytic person has jumped out of bed
on the cry of â€˜Fire.â€™ Cases too are known when a great shock, which
produces depression so profound as to amount to lethargy, is followed by
abnormal activity, and the calling into use of powers which were
previously unknown to exist, or at any rate existed in a quite ordinary
degree. Such a hyper-sensitised state, especially since the desire for
sleep or rest is very often much diminished, demands much stimulant in
the way of food and alcohol. It would appear also that the patient
suffering from this rare form of the after-consequences of shock has
sooner or later some sudden and complete break-down. It is impossible,
however, to conjecture what form this will take. The digestion, however,
may become suddenly atrophied, delirium tremens may, without warning,
supervene, or he may go completely off his head....â€

       *       *       *       *       *

But the weeks passed on, the July suns made London reel in a haze of
heat, and yet Alingham remained busy, brilliant and altogether
exceptional. Merwick, unknown to him, was watching him closely, and at
present was completely puzzled. He held Dick to his word that if he
could detect the slightest sign of over-indulgence in stimulant, he
would cut it off altogether, but he could see absolutely none. Lady
Madingley meantime had given him several sittings, and in this
connection again Merwick was utterly mistaken in the view he had
expressed to Dick as to the risks he ran. For, strangely enough, the two
had become great friends. Yet Dick was quite right, all emotion with
regard to her on his part was dead, it might have been a piece of
still-life that he was painting, instead of a woman he had wildly
worshipped.

One morning in mid-July she had been sitting to him in his studio, and
contrary to custom he had been rather silent, biting the ends of his
brushes, frowning at his canvas, frowning too at her. Suddenly he gave a
little impatient exclamation.

â€œItâ€™s so like you,â€ he said, â€œbut it just isnâ€™t you. Thereâ€™s a lot of
difference! I canâ€™t help making you look as if you were listening to a
hymn, one of those in four sharps, donâ€™t you know, written by an
organist, probably after eating muffins. And thatâ€™s not characteristic
of you!â€

She laughed.

â€œYou must be rather ingenious to put all that in,â€ she said.

â€œI am.â€

â€œWhere do I show it all?â€

Dick sighed.

â€œOh, in your eyes of course,â€ he said. â€œYou show everything by your
eyes, you know. It is entirely characteristic of you. You are a
throw-back; donâ€™t you remember we settled that ever so long ago, to the
brute creation, who likewise show everything by their eyes.â€

â€œOh-h. I should have thought that dogs growled at you, and cats
scratched.â€

â€œThose are practical measures, but short of that you and animals use
their eyes only, whereas people use their mouths and foreheads and other
things. A pleased dog, an expectant dog, a hungry dog, a jealous dog, a
disappointed dog--one gathers all that from a dogâ€™s eyes. Their mouths
are comparatively immobile, and a catâ€™s is even more so.â€

â€œYou have often told me that I belong to the genus cat,â€ said Lady
Madingley, with complete composure.

â€œBy Jove, yes,â€ said he. â€œPerhaps looking at the eyes of a cat would
help me to see what I miss. Many thanks for the hint.â€

He put down his palette and went to a side table on which stood bottles
and ice and syphons.

â€œNo drink of any kind on this Sahara of a morning?â€ he asked.

â€œNo, thanks. Now when will you give me the final sitting? You said you
only wanted one more.â€

Dick helped himself.

â€œWell, I go down to the country with this,â€ he said, â€œto put in the
background I told you of. With luck it will take me three days hard
painting, without luck a week or more. Oh, my mouth waters at the
thought of the background. So shall we say to-morrow week?â€

Lady Madingley made a note of this in a minute gold and jewelled
memorandum book.

â€œAnd I am to be prepared to see catâ€™s eyes painted there instead of my
own when I see it next?â€ she asked, passing by the canvas.

Dick laughed.

â€œOh, you will hardly notice the difference,â€ he said. â€œHow odd it is
that I always have detested cats so--they make me feel actually faint,
although you always reminded me of a cat.â€

â€œYou must ask your friend Mr Merwick about these metaphysical
mysteries,â€ said she.

       *       *       *       *       *

The background to the picture was at present only indicated by a few
vague splashes close to the side of the head of brilliant purple and
brilliant green, and the artistâ€™s mouth might well water at the thought
of the few days painting that lay before him. For behind the figure in
the long panel-shaped canvas was to be painted a green trellis, over
which, almost hiding the woodwork, there was to sprawl a great purple
clematis in full flaunting glory of varnished leaf and starry flower. At
the top would be just a strip of pale summer sky, at her feet just a
strip of grey-green grass, but all the rest of the background, greatly
daring, would be this diaper of green and purple. For the purpose of
putting this in, he was going down to a small cottage of his near
Godalming, where he had built in the garden a sort of outdoor studio, an
erection betwixt a room and a mere shelter, with the side to the north
entirely open, and flanked by this green trellis which was now one
immense constellation of purple stars. Framed in this, he well knew how
the strange pale beauty of his sitter would glow on the canvas, how she
would start out of the background, she and her huge grey hat, and
shining grey dress, and yellow hair and ivory white skin and pale eyes,
now blue, now grey, now green. This was indeed a thing to look forward
to, for there is probably no such unadulterated rapture known to men as
creation, and it was small wonder that Dickâ€™s mood, as he travelled down
to Godalming, was buoyant and effervescent. For he was going, so to
speak, to realise his creation: every purple star of clematis, every
green leaf and piece of trellis-work that he put in, would cause what he
had painted to live and shine, just as it is the layers of dusk that
fall over the sky at evening which make the stars to sparkle there,
jewel-like. His scheme was assured, he had hung his constellation--the
figure of Lady Madingley--in the sky: and now he had to surround it with
the green and purple night, so that it might shine.

His garden was but a circumscribed plot, but walls of old brick
circumscribed it, and he had dealt with the space at his command with a
certain originality. At no time had his grass plot (you could scarcely
call it â€œlawnâ€) been spacious; now the outdoor studio, twenty-five feet
by thirty, took up the greater part of it. He had a solid wooden wall on
one side and two trellis walls to the south and east, which creepers
were beginning to clothe and which were faced internally by hangings of
Syrian and Oriental work. Here in the summer he passed the greater part
of the day, painting or idling, and living an outdoor existence. The
floor, which had once been grass, which had withered completely under
the roof, was covered with Persian rugs; a writing-table, and a
dining-table were there, a bookcase full of familiar friends and a
half-dozen of basket chairs. One corner, too, was frankly given up to
the affairs of the garden, and a mowing machine, a hose for watering,
shears, and spade stood there. For like many excitable persons, Dick
found that in gardening, that incessant process of plannings and
designings to suit the likings of plants, and make them gorgeous in
colour and high of growth, there was a wonderful calm haven of refuge
for the brain that had been tossing on emotional seas. Plants, too, were
receptive, so responsive to kindness; thought given to them was never
thought wasted, and to come back now after a monthâ€™s absence in London
was to be assured of fresh surprise and pleasure in each foot of
garden-bed. And here, with how regal a generosity was the purple
clematis to repay him for the care lavished on it. Every flower would
show its practical gratitude by standing model for the background of his
picture.

The evening was very warm, warm not with any sultry premonition of
thunder, but with the clear, clean heat of summer, and he dined alone in
his shelter, with the after-flames of the sunset for his lamp. These
slowly faded into a sky of velvet blue, but he lingered long over his
coffee looking northwards across the garden towards the row of trees
that screened him from the house beyond. These were acacias, most
graceful and feminine of all green things that grow, summer-plumaged
now, yet still fresh of leaf. Below them ran a little raised terrace of
turf and nearer the beds of the beloved garden; clumps of sweet peas
made an inimitable fragrance, and the rose-beds were pink with _Baroness
Rothschild_ and _La France_, and copper-coloured with _BeautÃ©
inconstante_, and the _Richardson_ rose. Then, nearer at hand, was the
green trellis foaming with purple.

He was sitting there, hardly looking, but unconsciously drinking in this
great festival of colour, when his eye was arrested by a dark slinking
form that appeared among the roses, and suddenly turned two shining
luminous orbs on him. At this he started up, but his movement caused no
perturbation in the animal, which continued with back arched for
stroking, and poker-like tail, to advance towards him, purring. As it
came closer Dick felt that shuddering faintness, which often affected
him in the presence of cats, come over him, and he stamped and clapped
his hands. At this it turned tail quickly: a sort of dark shadow
streaked the garden-wall for a moment, and it vanished. But its
appearance had spoiled for him the sweet spell of the evening, and he
went indoors.

The next morning was pellucid summer: a faint north wind blew, and a sun
worthy to illumine the isles of Greece flooded the sky. Dickâ€™s dreamless
and (for him) long sleep had banished from his mind that rather
disquieting incident of the cat, and he set up his canvas facing the
trellis-work and purple clematis with a huge sense of imminent ecstasy.
Also the garden, which at present he had only seen in the magic of
sunset, was gloriously rewarding, and glowed with colour, and though
life--this was present to his mind for the first time for months--in
the shape of Lady Madingley had not been very propitious, yet a man, he
argued to himself, must be a very poor hand at living if, with a passion
for plants and a passion for art, he cannot fashion a life that shall be
full of content. So breakfast being finished, and his model ready and
glowing with beauty, he quickly sketched in the broad lines of flowers
and foliage and began to paint.

Purple and green, green and purple: was there ever such a feast for the
eye? Gourmet like and greedy as well, he was utterly absorbed in it. He
was right too: as soon as he put on the first brush of colour he knew he
was right. It was just those divine and violent colours which would
cause his figure to step out from the picture, it was just that pale
strip of sky above which would focus her again, it was just that strip
of grey-green grass below her feet that would prevent her, so it seemed,
from actually leaving the canvas. And with swift eager sweeps of the
brush which never paused and never hurried, he lost himself in his work.

He stopped at length with a sense of breathlessness, feeling too as if
he had been suddenly called back from some immense distance off. He must
have been working some three hours, for his man was already laying the
table for lunch, yet it seemed to him that the morning had gone by in
one flash. The progress he had made was extraordinary, and he looked
long at his picture. Then his eye wandered from the brightness of the
canvas to the brightness of the garden-beds. There, just in front of the
bed of sweet-peas, not two yards from him, stood a very large grey cat,
watching him.

Now the presence of a cat was a thing that usually produced in Dick a
feeling of deadly faintness, yet, at this moment, as he looked at the
cat and the cat at him, he was conscious of no such feeling, and put
down the absence of it, in so far as he consciously thought about it, to
the fact that he was in the open air, not in the atmosphere of a closed
room. Yet, last night out here, the cat had made him feel faint. But he
hardly gave a thought to this, for what filled his mind was that he saw
in the rather friendly interested look of the beast that expression in
the eye which had so baffled him in his portrait of Lady Madingley. So,
slowly, and without any sudden movement that might startle the cat, he
reached out his hand for the palette he had just put down, and in a
corner of the canvas not yet painted over, recorded in half a dozen
swift intuitive touches, what he wanted. Even in the broad sunlight
where the animal stood, its eyes looked as if they were internally
smouldering as well as being lit from without: it was just so that Lady
Madingley looked. He would have to lay colour very thinly over white....

For five minutes or so he painted them with quiet eager strokes,
drawing the colour thinly over the background of white, and then looked
long at that sketch of the eye to see if he had got what he wanted. Then
he looked back at the cat which had stood so charmingly for him. But
there was no cat there. That, however, since he detested them, and this
one had served his purpose, was no matter for regret, and he merely
wondered a little at the suddenness of its disappearance. But the legacy
it had left on the canvas could not vanish thus, it was his own, a
possession, an achievement. Truly this was to be a portrait which would
altogether out-distance all he had ever done before. A woman, real,
alive, wearing her soul in her eyes, should stand there, and summer riot
round her.

An extraordinary clearness of vision was his all day, and towards sunset
an empty whisky-bottle. But this evening he was conscious for the first
time of two feelings, one physical, one mental, altogether strange to
him: the first an impression that he had drunk as much as was good for
him, the second a sort of echo in his mind of those tortures he had
undergone in the autumn, when he had been tossed aside by the girl, to
whom he had given his soul, like a soiled glove. Neither were at all
acutely felt, but both were present to him.

The evening altogether belied the brilliance of the day, and about six
oâ€™clock thick clouds had driven up over the sky, and the clear heat of
summer had given place to a heat no less intense, but full of the
menace of storm. A few big hot drops, too, of rain warned him further,
and he pulled his easel into shelter, and gave orders that he would dine
indoors. As was usual with him when he was at work, he shunned the
distracting influence of any companionship, and he dined alone. Dinner
finished, he went into his sitting-room prepared to enjoy his solitary
evening. His servant had brought him in the tray, and till he went to
bed he would be undisturbed. Outside the storm was moving nearer, the
reverberation of the thunder, though not yet close, kept up a continual
growl: any moment it might move up and burst above in riot of fire and
sound.

Dick read a book for a while, but his thoughts wandered. The poignancy
of his trouble last autumn, which he thought had passed away from him
for ever, grew suddenly and strangely more acute, also his head was
heavy, perhaps with the storm, but possibly with what he had drunk. So,
intending to go to bed and sleep off his disquietude, he closed his
book, and went across to the window to close that also. But, half-way
towards it, he stopped. There on the sofa below it sat a large grey cat
with yellow gleaming eyes. In its mouth it held a young thrush, still
alive.

Then horror woke in him: his feeling of sick-faintness was there, and he
loathed and was terrified at this dreadful feline glee in the torture of
its prey, a glee so great that it preferred the postponement of its
meal to a shortening of the other. More than all, the resemblance of the
eyes of this cat to those of his portrait suddenly struck him as
something hellish. For one moment this all held him bound, as if with
paralysis, the next his physical shuddering could be withstood no
longer, and he threw the glass he carried at the cat, missing it. For
one second the animal paused there glaring at him with an intense and
dreadful hostility, then it made one spring of it out of the open
window. Dick shut it with a bang that startled himself, and then
searched on the sofa and the floor for the bird which he thought the cat
had dropped. Once or twice he thought he heard it feebly fluttering, but
this must have been an illusion, for he could not find it.

All this was rather shaky business, so before going to bed he steadied
himself, as his unspoken phrase ran, with a final drink. Outside the
thunder had ceased, but the rain beat hissing on to the grass. Then
another sound mingled with it, the mewing of a cat, not the long drawn
screeches and cries that are usual, but the plaintive calls of the beast
that wants to be admitted into its own home. The blind was down, but
after a while he could not resist peeping out. There on the window-sill
was seated the large grey cat. Though it was raining heavily its fur
seemed dry, for it was standing stiffly away from its body. But when it
saw him it spat at him, scratching angrily at the glass, and vanished.

Lady Madingley ... heavens, how he had loved her! And, infernally as she
had treated him, how passionately he wanted her now. Was all his trouble
then to begin over again? Had that nightmare dawned anew on him? It was
the catâ€™s fault: the eyes of the cat had done it. Yet just now all his
desire was blurred by this dullness of brain that was as unaccountable
as the re-awakening of his desire. For months now he had drunk far more
than he had drunk to-day, yet evening had seen him clear-headed, acute,
master of himself, and revelling in the liberty that had come to him,
and in the cool joy of creative vision. But to-night he stumbled and
groped across the room.

The neutral-coloured light of dawn awoke him, and he got up at once,
feeling still very drowsy, but in answer to some silent imperative call.
The storm had altogether passed away, and a jewel of a morning star hung
in a pale heaven. His room looked strangely unfamiliar to him, his own
sensations were unfamiliar, there was a vagueness about things, a
barrier between him and the world. One desire alone possessed him, to
finish the portrait. All else, so he felt, he left to chance, or
whatever laws regulate the world, those laws which choose that a certain
thrush shall be caught by a certain cat, and choose one scapegoat out of
a thousand, and let the rest go free.

Two hours later his servant called him, and found him gone from his
room. So as the morning was so fair, he went out to lay breakfast in the
shelter. The portrait was there, it had been dragged back into position
by the clematis, but it was covered with strange scratches, as if the
claws of some enraged animal or the nails perhaps of a man had furiously
attacked it. Dick Alingham was there, too, lying very still in front of
the disfigured canvas. Claws, also, or nails had attacked him, his
throat was horribly mangled by them. But his hands were covered with
paint, the nails of his fingers too were choked with it.




THE BUS-CONDUCTOR


My friend, Hugh Grainger, and I had just returned from a two daysâ€™ visit
in the country, where we had been staying in a house of sinister repute
which was supposed to be haunted by ghosts of a peculiarly fearsome and
truculent sort. The house itself was all that such a house should be,
Jacobean and oak-panelled, with long dark passages and high vaulted
rooms. It stood, also, very remote, and was encompassed by a wood of
sombre pines that muttered and whispered in the dark, and all the time
that we were there a south-westerly gale with torrents of scolding rain
had prevailed, so that by day and night weird voices moaned and fluted
in the chimneys, a company of uneasy spirits held colloquy among the
trees, and sudden tattoes and tappings beckoned from the window-panes.
But in spite of these surroundings, which were sufficient in themselves,
one would almost say, to spontaneously generate occult phenomena,
nothing of any description had occurred. I am bound to add, also, that
my own state of mind was peculiarly well adapted to receive or even to
invent the sights and sounds we had gone to seek, for I was, I confess,
during the whole time that we were there, in a state of abject
apprehension, and lay awake both nights through hours of terrified
unrest, afraid of the dark, yet more afraid of what a lighted candle
might show me.

Hugh Grainger, on the evening after our return to town, had dined with
me, and after dinner our conversation, as was natural, soon came back to
these entrancing topics.

â€œBut why you go ghost-seeking I cannot imagine,â€ he said, â€œbecause your
teeth were chattering and your eyes starting out of your head all the
time you were there, from sheer fright. Or do you like being
frightened?â€

Hugh, though generally intelligent, is dense in certain ways; this is
one of them.

â€œWhy, of course, I like being frightened,â€ I said. â€œI want to be made to
creep and creep and creep. Fear is the most absorbing and luxurious of
emotions. One forgets all else if one is afraid.â€

â€œWell, the fact that neither of us saw anything,â€ he said, â€œconfirms
what I have always believed.â€

â€œAnd what have you always believed?â€

â€œThat these phenomena are purely objective, not subjective, and that
oneâ€™s state of mind has nothing to do with the perception that perceives
them, nor have circumstances or surroundings anything to do with them
either. Look at Osburton. It has had the reputation of being a haunted
house for years, and it certainly has all the accessories of one. Look
at yourself, too, with all your nerves on edge, afraid to look round or
light a candle for fear of seeing something! Surely there was the right
man in the right place then, if ghosts are subjective.â€

He got up and lit a cigarette, and looking at him--Hugh is about six
feet high, and as broad as he is long--I felt a retort on my lips, for I
could not help my mind going back to a certain period in his life, when,
from some cause which, as far as I knew, he had never told anybody, he
had become a mere quivering mass of disordered nerves. Oddly enough, at
the same moment and for the first time, he began, to speak of it
himself.

â€œYou may reply that it was not worth my while to go either,â€ he said,
â€œbecause I was so clearly the wrong man in the wrong place. But I
wasnâ€™t. You for all your apprehensions and expectancy have never seen a
ghost. But I have, though I am the last person in the world you would
have thought likely to do so, and, though my nerves are steady enough
again now, it knocked me all to bits.â€

He sat down again in his chair.

â€œNo doubt you remember my going to bits,â€ he said, â€œand since I believe
that I am sound again now, I should rather like to tell you about it.
But before I couldnâ€™t; I couldnâ€™t speak of it at all to anybody. Yet
there ought to have been nothing frightening about it; what I saw was
certainly a most useful and friendly ghost. But it came from the shaded
side of things; it looked suddenly out of the night and the mystery with
which life is surrounded.â€

â€œI want first to tell you quite shortly my theory about ghost-seeing,â€
he continued, â€œand I can explain it best by a simile, an image. Imagine
then that you and I and everybody in the world are like people whose eye
is directly opposite a little tiny hole in a sheet of cardboard which is
continually shifting and revolving and moving about. Back to back with
that sheet of cardboard is another, which also, by laws of its own, is
in perpetual but independent motion. In it too there is another hole,
and when, fortuitously it would seem, these two holes, the one through
which we are always looking, and the other in the spiritual plane, come
opposite one another, we see through, and then only do the sights and
sounds of the spiritual world become visible or audible to us. With most
people these holes never come opposite each other during their life. But
at the hour of death they do, and then they remain stationary. That, I
fancy, is how we â€˜pass over.â€™

â€œNow, in some natures, these holes are comparatively large, and are
constantly coming into opposition. Clairvoyants, mediums are like that.
But, as far as I knew, I had no clairvoyant or mediumistic powers at
all. I therefore am the sort of person who long ago made up his mind
that he never would see a ghost. It was, so to speak, an incalculable
chance that my minute spy-hole should come into opposition with the
other. But it did: and it knocked me out of time.â€

I had heard some such theory before, and though Hugh put it rather
picturesquely, there was nothing in the least convincing or practical
about it. It might be so, or again it might not.

â€œI hope your ghost was more original than your theory,â€ said I, in order
to bring him to the point.

â€œYes, I think it was. You shall judge.â€

I put on more coal and poked up the fire. Hugh has got, so I have always
considered, a great talent for telling stories, and that sense of drama
which is so necessary for the narrator. Indeed before now, I have
suggested to him that he should take this up as a profession, sit by the
fountain in Piccadilly Circus, when times are, as usual, bad, and tell
stories to the passers-by in the street, Arabian fashion, for reward.
The most part of mankind, I am aware, do not like long stories, but to
the few, among whom I number myself, who really like to listen to
lengthy accounts of experiences, Hugh is an ideal narrator. I do not
care for his theories, or for his similes, but when it comes to facts,
to things that happened, I like him to be lengthy.

â€œGo on, please, and slowly,â€ I said. â€œBrevity may be the soul of wit,
but it is the ruin of storytelling. I want to hear when and where and
how it all was, and what you had for lunch and where you had dined and
what----â€

Hugh began:

â€œIt was the 24th of June, just eighteen months ago,â€ he said. â€œI had let
my flat, you may remember, and came up from the country to stay with you
for a week. We had dined alone here----â€

I could not help interrupting.

â€œDid you see the ghost here?â€ I asked. â€œIn this square little box of a
house in a modern street?â€

â€œI was in the house when I saw it.â€

I hugged myself in silence.

â€œWe had dined alone here in Graeme Street,â€ he said, â€œand after dinner I
went out to some party, and you stopped at home. At dinner your man did
not wait, and when I asked where he was, you told me he was ill, and, I
thought, changed the subject rather abruptly. You gave me your latch-key
when I went out, and on coming back, I found you had gone to bed. There
were, however, several letters for me, which required answers. I wrote
them there and then, and posted them at the pillar-box opposite. So I
suppose it was rather late when I went upstairs.

â€œYou had put me in the front room, on the third floor, overlooking the
street, a room which I thought you generally occupied yourself. It was a
very hot night, and though there had been a moon when I started to my
party, on my return the whole sky was cloud-covered, and it both looked
and felt as if we might have a thunderstorm before morning. I was
feeling very sleepy and heavy, and it was not till after I had got into
bed that I noticed by the shadows of the window-frames on the blind that
only one of the windows was open. But it did not seem worth while to get
out of bed in order to open it, though I felt rather airless and
uncomfortable, and I went to sleep.

â€œWhat time it was when I awoke I do not know, but it was certainly not
yet dawn, and I never remember being conscious of such an extraordinary
stillness as prevailed. There was no sound either of foot-passengers or
wheeled traffic; the music of life appeared to be absolutely mute. But
now instead of being sleepy and heavy, I felt, though I must have slept
an hour or two at most, since it was not yet dawn, perfectly fresh and
wide-awake, and the effort which had seemed not worth making before,
that of getting out of bed and opening the other window, was quite easy
now, and I pulled up the blind, threw it wide open, and leaned out, for
somehow I parched and pined for air. Even outside the oppression was
very noticeable, and though, as you know, I am not easily given to feel
the mental effects of climate, I was aware of an awful creepiness coming
over me. I tried to analyse it away, but without success; the past day
had been pleasant, I looked forward to another pleasant day to-morrow,
and yet I was full of some nameless apprehension. I felt, too,
dreadfully lonely in this stillness before the dawn.

â€œThen I heard suddenly and not very far away the sound of some
approaching vehicle; I could distinguish the tread of two horses walking
at a slow footâ€™s pace. They were, though yet invisible, coming up the
street, and yet this indication of life did not abate that dreadful
sense of loneliness which I have spoken of. Also in some dim
unformulated way that which was coming seemed to me to have something to
do with the cause of my oppression.

â€œThen the vehicle came into sight. At first I could not distinguish what
it was. Then I saw that the horses were black and had long tails, and
that what they dragged was made of glass, but had a black frame. It was
a hearse. Empty.

â€œIt was moving up this side of the street. It stopped at your door.

â€œThen the obvious solution struck me. You had said at dinner that your
man was ill, and you were, I thought, unwilling to speak more about his
illness. No doubt, so I imagined now, he was dead, and for some reason,
perhaps because you did not want me to know anything about it, you were
having the body removed at night. This, I must tell you, passed through
my mind quite instantaneously, and it did not occur to me how unlikely
it really was, before the next thing happened.

â€œI was still leaning out of the window, and I remember also wondering,
yet only momentarily, how odd it was that I saw things--or rather the
one thing I was looking at--so very distinctly. Of course, there was a
moon behind the clouds, but it was curious how every detail of the
hearse and the horses was visible. There was only one man, the driver,
with it, and the street was otherwise absolutely empty. It was at him I
was looking now. I could see every detail of his clothes, but from where
I was, so high above him, I could not see his face. He had on grey
trousers, brown boots, a black coat buttoned all the way up, and a straw
hat. Over his shoulder there was a strap, which seemed to support some
sort of little bag. He looked exactly like--well, from my description
what did he look exactly like?â€

â€œWhy--a bus-conductor,â€ I said instantly.

â€œSo I thought, and even while I was thinking this, he looked up at me.
He had a rather long thin face, and on his left cheek there was a mole
with a growth of dark hair on it. All this was as distinct as if it had
been noonday, and as if I was within a yard of him. But--so
instantaneous was all that takes so long in the telling--I had not time
to think it strange that the driver of a hearse should be so
unfunereally dressed.

â€œThen he touched his hat to me, and jerked his thumb over his shoulder.â€

â€œâ€˜Just room for one inside, sir,â€™ he said.

â€œThere was something so odious, so coarse, so unfeeling about this that
I instantly drew my head in, pulled the blind down again, and then, for
what reason I do not know, turned on the electric light in order to see
what time it was. The hands of my watch pointed to half-past eleven.

â€œIt was then for the first time, I think, that a doubt crossed my mind
as to the nature of what I had just seen. But I put out the light again,
got into bed, and began to think. We had dined; I had gone to a party, I
had come back and written letters, had gone to bed and had slept. So how
could it be half-past eleven?... Or--_what_ half-past eleven was it?

â€œThen another easy solution struck me; my watch must have stopped. But
it had not; I could hear it ticking.

â€œThere was stillness and silence again. I expected every moment to hear
muffled footsteps on the stairs, footsteps moving slowly and smally
under the weight of a heavy burden, but from inside the house there was
no sound whatever. Outside, too, there was the same dead silence, while
the hearse waited at the door. And the minutes ticked on and ticked on,
and at length I began to see a difference in the light in the room, and
knew that the dawn was beginning to break outside. But how had it
happened then that if the corpse was to be removed at night it had not
gone, and that the hearse still waited, when morning was already coming?

â€œPresently I got out of bed again, and with the sense of strong physical
shrinking I went to the window and pulled back the blind. The dawn was
coming fast; the whole street was lit by that silver hueless light of
morning. But there was no hearse there.

â€œOnce again I looked at my watch. It was just a quarter-past four. But I
would swear that not half an hour had passed since it had told me that
it was half-past eleven.

â€œThen a curious double sense, as if I was living in the present and at
the same moment had been living in some other time, came over me. It was
dawn on June 25th, and the street, as natural, was empty. But a little
while ago the driver of a hearse had spoken to me, and it was half-past
eleven. What was that driver, to what plane did he belong? And again
_what_ half-past eleven was it that I had seen recorded on the dial of
my watch?

â€œAnd then I told myself that the whole thing had been a dream. But if
you ask me whether I believed what I told myself, I must confess that I
did not.

â€œYour man did not appear at breakfast next morning, nor did I see him
again before I left that afternoon. I think if I had, I should have told
you about all this, but it was still possible, you see, that what I had
seen was a real hearse, driven by a real driver, for all the ghastly
gaiety of the face that had looked up to mine, and the levity of his
pointing hand. I might possibly have fallen asleep soon after seeing
him, and slumbered through the removal of the body and the departure of
the hearse. So I did not speak of it to you.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

There was something wonderfully straightforward and prosaic in all this;
here were no Jacobean houses oak-panelled and surrounded by weeping
pine-trees, and somehow the very absence of suitable surroundings made
the story more impressive. But for a moment a doubt assailed me.

â€œDonâ€™t tell me it was all a dream,â€ I said.

â€œI donâ€™t know whether it was or not. I can only say that I believe
myself to have been wide awake. In any case the rest of the story
is--odd.â€

â€œI went out of town again that afternoon,â€ he continued, â€œand I may say
that I donâ€™t think that even for a moment did I get the haunting sense
of what I had seen or dreamed that night out of my mind. It was present
to me always as some vision unfulfilled. It was as if some clock had
struck the four quarters, and I was still waiting to hear what the hour
would be.

â€œExactly a month afterwards I was in London again, but only for the day.
I arrived at Victoria about eleven, and took the underground to Sloane
Square in order to see if you were in town and would give me lunch. It
was a baking hot morning, and I intended to take a bus from the Kingâ€™s
Road as far as Graeme Street. There was one standing at the corner just
as I came out of the station, but I saw that the top was full, and the
inside appeared to be full also. Just as I came up to it the conductor
who, I suppose, had been inside, collecting fares or what not, came out
on to the step within a few feet of me. He wore grey trousers, brown
boots, a black coat buttoned, a straw hat, and over his shoulder was a
strap on which hung his little machine for punching tickets. I saw his
face, too; it was the face of the driver of the hearse, with a mole on
the left cheek. Then he spoke to me, jerking his thumb over his
shoulder.

â€œâ€˜Just room for one inside, sir,â€™ he said.

â€œAt that a sort of panic-terror took possession of me, and I knew I
gesticulated wildly with my arms, and cried, â€˜No, no!â€™ But at that
moment I was living not in the hour that was then passing, but in that
hour which had passed a month ago, when I leaned from the window of your
bedroom here just before the dawn broke. At this moment too I knew that
my spy-hole had been opposite the spy-hole into the spiritual world.
What I had seen there had some significance, now being fulfilled, beyond
the significance of the trivial happenings of to-day and to-morrow. The
Powers of which we know so little were visibly working before me. And I
stood there on the pavement shaking and trembling.

â€œI was opposite the post-office at the corner, and just as the bus
started my eye fell on the clock in the window there. I need not tell
you what the time was.

â€œPerhaps I need not tell you the rest, for you probably conjecture it,
since you will not have forgotten what happened at the corner of Sloane
Square at the end of July, the summer before last. The bus pulled out
from the pavement into the street in order to get round a van that was
standing in front of it. At the moment there came down the Kingâ€™s Road a
big motor going at a hideously dangerous pace. It crashed full into the
bus, burrowing into it as a gimlet burrows into a board.â€

He paused.

â€œAnd thatâ€™s my story,â€ he said.




THE MAN WHO WENT TOO FAR


The little village of St Faithâ€™s nestles in a hollow of wooded hill up
on the north bank of the river Fawn in the county of Hampshire, huddling
close round its grey Norman church as if for spiritual protection
against the fays and fairies, the trolls and â€œlittle people,â€ who might
be supposed still to linger in the vast empty spaces of the New Forest,
and to come after dusk and do their doubtful businesses. Once outside
the hamlet you may walk in any direction (so long as you avoid the high
road which leads to Brockenhurst) for the length of a summer afternoon
without seeing sign of human habitation, or possibly even catching sight
of another human being. Shaggy wild ponies may stop their feeding for a
moment as you pass, the white scuts of rabbits will vanish into their
burrows, a brown viper perhaps will glide from your path into a clump of
heather, and unseen birds will chuckle in the bushes, but it may easily
happen that for a long day you will see nothing human. But you will not
feel in the least lonely; in summer, at any rate, the sunlight will be
gay with butterflies, and the air thick with all those woodland sounds
which like instruments in an orchestra combine to play the great
symphony of the yearly festival of June. Winds whisper in the birches,
and sigh among the firs; bees are busy with their redolent labour among
the heather, a myriad birds chirp in the green temples of the forest
trees, and the voice of the river prattling over stony places, bubbling
into pools, chuckling and gulping round corners, gives you the sense
that many presences and companions are near at hand.

Yet, oddly enough, though one would have thought that these benign and
cheerful influences of wholesome air and spaciousness of forest were
very healthful comrades for a man, in so far as nature can really
influence this wonderful human genus which has in these centuries
learned to defy her most violent storms in its well-established houses,
to bridle her torrents and make them light its streets, to tunnel her
mountains and plough her seas, the inhabitants of St Faithâ€™s will not
willingly venture into the forest after dark. For in spite of the
silence and loneliness of the hooded night it seems that a man is not
sure in what company he may suddenly find himself, and though it is
difficult to get from these villagers any very clear story of occult
appearances, the feeling is widespread. One story indeed I have heard
with some definiteness, the tale of a monstrous goat that has been seen
to skip with hellish glee about the woods and shady places, and this
perhaps is connected with the story which I have here attempted to
piece together. It too is well-known to them; for all remember the young
artist who died here not long ago, a young man, or so he struck the
beholder, of great personal beauty, with something about him that made
menâ€™s faces to smile and brighten when they looked on him. His ghost
they will tell you â€œwalksâ€ constantly by the stream and through the
woods which he loved so, and in especial it haunts a certain house, the
last of the village, where he lived, and its garden in which he was done
to death. For my part I am inclined to think that the terror of the
Forest dates chiefly from that day. So, such as the story is, I have set
it forth in connected form. It is based partly on the accounts of the
villagers, but mainly on that of Darcy, a friend of mine and a friend of
the man with whom these events were chiefly concerned.

       *       *       *       *       *

The day had been one of untarnished midsummer splendour, and as the sun
drew near to its setting, the glory of the evening grew every moment
more crystalline, more miraculous. Westward from St Faithâ€™s the
beechwood which stretched for some miles toward the heathery upland
beyond already cast its veil of clear shadow over the red roofs of the
village, but the spire of the grey church, overtopping all, still
pointed a flaming orange finger into the sky. The river Fawn, which runs
below, lay in sheets of sky-reflected blue, and wound its dreamy
devious course round the edge of this wood, where a rough two-planked
bridge crossed from the bottom of the garden of the last house in the
village, and communicated by means of a little wicker gate with the wood
itself. Then once out of the shadow of the wood the stream lay in
flaming pools of the molten crimson of the sunset, and lost itself in
the haze of woodland distances.

This house at the end of the village stood outside the shadow, and the
lawn which sloped down to the river was still flecked with sunlight.
Garden-beds of dazzling colour lined its gravel walks, and down the
middle of it ran a brick pergola, half-hidden in clusters of
rambler-rose and purple with starry clematis. At the bottom end of it,
between two of its pillars, was slung a hammock containing a
shirt-sleeved figure.

The house itself lay somewhat remote from the rest of the village, and a
footpath leading across two fields, now tall and fragrant with hay, was
its only communication with the high road. It was low-built, only two
stories in height, and like the garden, its walls were a mass of
flowering roses. A narrow stone terrace ran along the garden front, over
which was stretched an awning, and on the terrace a young silent-footed
man-servant was busied with the laying of the table for dinner. He was
neat-handed and quick with his job, and having finished it he went back
into the house, and reappeared again with a large rough bath-towel on
his arm. With this he went to the hammock in the pergola.

â€œNearly eight, sir,â€ he said.

â€œHas Mr Darcy come yet?â€ asked a voice from the hammock.

â€œNo, sir.â€

â€œIf Iâ€™m not back when he comes, tell him that Iâ€™m just having a bathe
before dinner.â€

The servant went back to the house, and after a moment or two Frank
Halton struggled to a sitting posture, and slipped out on to the grass.
He was of medium height and rather slender in build, but the supple ease
and grace of his movements gave the impression of great physical
strength: even his descent from the hammock was not an awkward
performance. His face and hands were of very dark complexion, either
from constant exposure to wind and sun, or, as his black hair and dark
eyes tended to show, from some strain of southern blood. His head was
small, his face of an exquisite beauty of modelling, while the
smoothness of its contour would have led you to believe that he was a
beardless lad still in his teens. But something, some look which living
and experience alone can give, seemed to contradict that, and finding
yourself completely puzzled as to his age, you would next moment
probably cease to think about that, and only look at this glorious
specimen of young manhood with wondering satisfaction.

He was dressed as became the season and the heat, and wore only a shirt
open at the neck, and a pair of flannel trousers. His head, covered very
thickly with a somewhat rebellious crop of short curly hair, was bare as
he strolled across the lawn to the bathing-place that lay below. Then
for a moment there was silence, then the sound of splashed and divided
waters, and presently after, a great shout of ecstatic joy, as he swam
up-stream with the foamed water standing in a frill round his neck. Then
after some five minutes of limb-stretching struggle with the flood, he
turned over on his back, and with arms thrown wide, floated down-stream,
ripple-cradled and inert. His eyes were shut, and between half-parted
lips he talked gently to himself.

â€œI am one with it,â€ he said to himself, â€œthe river and I, I and the
river. The coolness and splash of it is I, and the water-herbs that wave
in it are I also. And my strength and my limbs are not mine but the
riverâ€™s. It is all one, all one, dear Fawn.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

A quarter of an hour later he appeared again at the bottom of the lawn,
dressed as before, his wet hair already drying into its crisp short
curls again. There he paused a moment, looking back at the stream with
the smile with which men look on the face of a friend, then turned
towards the house. Simultaneously his servant came to the door leading
on to the terrace, followed by a man who appeared to be some half-way
through the fourth decade of his years. Frank and he saw each other
across the bushes and garden-beds, and each quickening his step, they
met suddenly face to face round an angle of the garden walk, in the
fragrance of syringa.

â€œMy dear Darcy,â€ cried Frank, â€œI am charmed to see you.â€

But the other stared at him in amazement.

â€œFrank!â€ he exclaimed.

â€œYes, that is my name,â€ he said laughing, â€œwhat is the matter?â€

Darcy took his hand.

â€œWhat have you done to yourself?â€ he asked. â€œYou are a boy again.â€

â€œAh, I have a lot to tell you,â€ said Frank. â€œLots that you will hardly
believe, but I shall convince you----â€

He broke off suddenly, and held up his hand.

â€œHush, there is my nightingale,â€ he said.

The smile of recognition and welcome with which he had greeted his
friend faded from his face, and a look of rapt wonder took its place, as
of a lover listening to the voice of his beloved. His mouth parted
slightly, showing the white line of teeth, and his eyes looked out and
out till they seemed to Darcy to be focussed on things beyond the vision
of man. Then something perhaps startled the bird, for the song ceased.

â€œYes, lots to tell you,â€ he said. â€œReally I am delighted to see you.
But you look rather white and pulled down; no wonder after that fever.
And there is to be no nonsense about this visit. It is June now, you
stop here till you are fit to begin work again. Two months at least.â€

â€œAh, I canâ€™t trespass quite to that extent.â€

Frank took his arm and walked him down the grass.

â€œTrespass? Who talks of trespass? I shall tell you quite openly when I
am tired of you, but you know when we had the studio together, we used
not to bore each other. However, it is ill talking of going away on the
moment of your arrival. Just a stroll to the river, and then it will be
dinner-time.â€

Darcy took out his cigarette case, and offered it to the other.

Frank laughed.

â€œNo, not for me. Dear me, I suppose I used to smoke once. How very odd!â€

â€œGiven it up?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know. I suppose I must have. Anyhow I donâ€™t do it now. I would
as soon think of eating meat.â€

â€œAnother victim on the smoking altar of vegetarianism?â€

â€œVictim?â€ asked Frank. â€œDo I strike you as such?â€

He paused on the margin of the stream and whistled softly. Next moment a
moor-hen made its splashing flight across the river, and ran up the
bank. Frank took it very gently in his hands and stroked its head, as
the creature lay against his shirt.

â€œAnd is the house among the reeds still secure?â€ he half-crooned to it.
â€œAnd is the missus quite well, and are the neighbours flourishing?
There, dear, home with you,â€ and he flung it into the air.

â€œThat birdâ€™s very tame,â€ said Darcy, slightly bewildered.

â€œIt is rather,â€ said Frank, following its flight.

       *       *       *       *       *

During dinner Frank chiefly occupied himself in bringing himself
up-to-date in the movements and achievements of this old friend whom he
had not seen for six years. Those six years, it now appeared, had been
full of incident and success for Darcy; he had made a name for himself
as a portrait painter which bade fair to outlast the vogue of a couple
of seasons, and his leisure time had been brief. Then some four months
previously he had been through a severe attack of typhoid, the result of
which as concerns this story was that he had come down to this
sequestered place to recruit.

â€œYes, youâ€™ve got on,â€ said Frank at the end. â€œI always knew you would.
A.R.A. with more in prospect. Money? You roll in it, I suppose, and, O
Darcy, how much happiness have you had all these years? That is the only
imperishable possession. And how much have you learned? Oh, I donâ€™t mean
in Art. Even I could have done well in that.â€

Darcy laughed.

â€œDone well? My dear fellow, all I have learned in these six years you
knew, so to speak, in your cradle. Your old pictures fetch huge prices.
Do you never paint now?â€

Frank shook his head.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m too busy,â€ he said.

â€œDoing what? Please tell me. That is what everyone is for ever asking
me.â€

â€œDoing? I suppose you would say I do nothing.â€

Darcy glanced up at the brilliant young face opposite him.

â€œIt seems to suit you, that way of being busy,â€ he said. â€œNow, itâ€™s your
turn. Do you read? Do you study? I remember you saying that it would do
us all--all us artists, I mean--a great deal of good if we would study
any one human face carefully for a year, without recording a line. Have
you been doing that?â€

Frank shook his head again.

â€œI mean exactly what I say,â€ he said, â€œI have been _doing_ nothing. And
I have never been so occupied. Look at me; have I not done something to
myself to begin with?â€

â€œYou are two years younger than I,â€ said Darcy, â€œat least you used to
be. You therefore are thirty-five. But had I never seen you before I
should say you were just twenty. But was it worth while to spend six
years of greatly-occupied life in order to look twenty? Seems rather
like a woman of fashion.â€

Frank laughed boisterously.

â€œFirst time Iâ€™ve ever been compared to that particular bird of prey,â€ he
said. â€œNo, that has not been my occupation--in fact I am only very
rarely conscious that one effect of my occupation has been that. Of
course, it must have been if one comes to think of it. It is not very
important. Quite true my body has become young. But that is very little;
I have become young.â€

Darcy pushed back his chair and sat sideways to the table looking at the
other.

â€œHas that been your occupation then?â€ he asked.

â€œYes, that anyhow is one aspect of it. Think what youth means! It is the
capacity for growth, mind, body, spirit, all grow, all get stronger, all
have a fuller, firmer life every day. That is something, considering
that every day that passes after the ordinary man reaches the full-blown
flower of his strength, weakens his hold on life. A man reaches his
prime, and remains, we say, in his prime, for ten years, or perhaps
twenty. But after his primest prime is reached, he slowly, insensibly
weakens. These are the signs of age in you, in your body, in your art
probably, in your mind. You are less electric than you were. But I, when
I reach my prime--I am nearing it--ah, you shall see.â€

The stars had begun to appear in the blue velvet of the sky, and to the
east the horizon seen above the black silhouette of the village was
growing dove-coloured with the approach of moon-rise. White moths
hovered dimly over the garden-beds, and the footsteps of night tip-toed
through the bushes. Suddenly Frank rose.

â€œAh, it is the supreme moment,â€ he said softly. â€œNow more than at any
other time the current of life, the eternal imperishable current runs so
close to me that I am almost enveloped in it. Be silent a minute.â€

He advanced to the edge of the terrace and looked out standing stretched
with arms outspread. Darcy heard him draw a long breath into his lungs,
and after many seconds expel it again. Six or eight times he did this,
then turned back into the lamplight.

â€œIt will sound to you quite mad, I expect,â€ he said, â€œbut if you want to
hear the soberest truth I have ever spoken and shall ever speak, I will
tell you about myself. But come into the garden if it is not too damp
for you. I have never told anyone yet, but I shall like to tell you. It
is long, in fact, since I have even tried to classify what I have
learned.â€

They wandered into the fragrant dimness of the pergola, and sat down.
Then Frank began:

â€œYears ago, do you remember,â€ he said, â€œwe used often to talk about the
decay of joy in the world. Many impulses, we settled, had contributed
to this decay, some of which were good in themselves, others that were
quite completely bad. Among the good things, I put what we may call
certain Christian virtues, renunciation, resignation, sympathy with
suffering, and the desire to relieve sufferers. But out of those things
spring very bad ones, useless renunciations, asceticism for its own
sake, mortification of the flesh with nothing to follow, no
corresponding gain that is, and that awful and terrible disease which
devastated England some centuries ago, and from which by heredity of
spirit we suffer now, Puritanism. That was a dreadful plague, the brutes
held and taught that joy and laughter and merriment were evil: it was a
doctrine the most profane and wicked. Why, what is the commonest crime
one sees? A sullen face. That is the truth of the matter.

â€œNow all my life I have believed that we are intended to be happy, that
joy is of all gifts the most divine. And when I left London, abandoned
my career, such as it was, I did so because I intended to devote my life
to the cultivation of joy, and, by continuous and unsparing effort, to
be happy. Among people, and in constant intercourse with others, I did
not find it possible; there were too many distractions in towns and
work-rooms, and also too much suffering. So I took one step backwards or
forwards, as you may choose to put it, and went straight to Nature, to
trees, birds, animals, to all those things which quite clearly pursue
one aim only, which blindly follow the great native instinct to be happy
without any care at all for morality, or human law or divine law. I
wanted, you understand, to get all joy first-hand and unadulterated, and
I think it scarcely exists among men; it is obsolete.â€

Darcy turned in his chair.

â€œAh, but what makes birds and animals happy?â€ he asked. â€œFood, food and
mating.â€

Frank laughed gently in the stillness.

â€œDo not think I became a sensualist,â€ he said. â€œI did not make that
mistake. For the sensualist carries his miseries pick-a-back, and round
his feet is wound the shroud that shall soon enwrap him. I may be mad,
it is true, but I am not so stupid anyhow as to have tried that. No,
what is it that makes puppies play with their own tails, that sends cats
on their prowling ecstatic errands at night?â€

He paused a moment.

â€œSo I went to Nature,â€ he said. â€œI sat down here in this New Forest, sat
down fair and square, and looked. That was my first difficulty, to sit
here quiet without being bored, to wait without being impatient, to be
receptive and very alert, though for a long time nothing particular
happened. The change in fact was slow in those early stages.â€

â€œNothing happened?â€ asked Darcy rather impatiently, with the sturdy
revolt against any new idea which to the English mind is synonymous
with nonsense. â€œWhy, what in the world _should_ happen?â€

Now Frank as he had known him was the most generous but most
quick-tempered of mortal men; in other words his anger would flare to a
prodigious beacon, under almost no provocation, only to be quenched
again under a gust of no less impulsive kindliness. Thus the moment
Darcy had spoken, an apology for his hasty question was half-way up his
tongue. But there was no need for it to have travelled even so far, for
Frank laughed again with kindly, genuine mirth.

â€œOh, how I should have resented that a few years ago,â€ he said. â€œThank
goodness that resentment is one of the things I have got rid of. I
certainly wish that you should believe my story--in fact, you are going
to--but that you at this moment should imply that you do not, does not
concern me.â€

â€œAh, your solitary sojournings have made you inhuman,â€ said Darcy, still
very English.

â€œNo, human,â€ said Frank. â€œRather more human, at least rather less of an
ape.â€

â€œWell, that was my first quest,â€ he continued, after a moment, â€œthe
deliberate and unswerving pursuit of joy, and my method, the eager
contemplation of Nature. As far as motive went, I daresay it was purely
selfish, but as far as effect goes, it seems to me about the best thing
one can do for oneâ€™s fellow-creatures, for happiness is more infectious
than small-pox. So, as I said, I sat down and waited; I looked at happy
things, zealously avoided the sight of anything unhappy, and by degrees
a little trickle of the happiness of this blissful world began to filter
into me. The trickle grew more abundant, and now, my dear fellow, if I
could for a moment divert from me into you one half of the torrent of
joy that pours through me day and night, you would throw the world, art,
everything aside, and just live, exist. When a manâ€™s body dies, it
passes into trees and flowers. Well, that is what I have been trying to
do with my soul before death.â€

The servant had brought into the pergola a table with syphons and
spirits, and had set a lamp upon it. As Frank spoke he leaned forward
towards the other, and Darcy for all his matter-of-fact common-sense
could have sworn that his companionâ€™s face shone, was luminous in
itself. His dark brown eyes glowed from within, the unconscious smile of
a child irradiated and transformed his face. Darcy felt suddenly
excited, exhilarated.

â€œGo on,â€ he said. â€œGo on. I can feel you are somehow telling me sober
truth. I daresay you are mad; but I donâ€™t see that matters.â€

Frank laughed again.

â€œMad?â€ he said. â€œYes, certainly, if you wish. But I prefer to call it
sane. However, nothing matters less than what anybody chooses to call
things. God never labels his gifts; He just puts them into our hands;
just as he put animals in the garden of Eden, for Adam to name if he
felt disposed.â€

â€œSo by the continual observance and study of things that were happy,â€
continued he, â€œI got happiness, I got joy. But seeking it, as I did,
from Nature, I got much more which I did not seek, but stumbled upon
originally by accident. It is difficult to explain, but I will try.

â€œAbout three years ago I was sitting one morning in a place I will show
you to-morrow. It is down by the river brink, very green, dappled with
shade and sun, and the river passes there through some little clumps of
reeds. Well, as I sat there, doing nothing, but just looking and
listening, I heard the sound quite distinctly of some flute-like
instrument playing a strange unending melody. I thought at first it was
some musical yokel on the highway and did not pay much attention. But
before long the strangeness and indescribable beauty of the tune struck
me. It never repeated itself, but it never came to an end, phrase after
phrase ran its sweet course, it worked gradually and inevitably up to a
climax, and having attained it, it went on; another climax was reached
and another and another. Then with a sudden gasp of wonder I localised
where it came from. It came from the reeds and from the sky and from the
trees. It was everywhere, it was the sound of life. It was, my dear
Darcy, as the Greeks would have said, it was Pan playing on his pipes,
the voice of Nature. It was the life-melody, the world-melody.â€

Darcy was far too interested to interrupt, though there was a question
he would have liked to ask, and Frank went on:

â€œWell, for the moment I was terrified, terrified with the impotent
horror of nightmare, and I stopped my ears and just ran from the place
and got back to the house panting, trembling, literally in a panic.
Unknowingly, for at that time I only pursued joy, I had begun, since I
drew my joy from Nature, to get in touch with Nature. Nature, force,
God, call it what you will, had drawn across my face a little gossamer
web of essential life. I saw that when I emerged from my terror, and I
went very humbly back to where I had heard the Pan-pipes. But it was
nearly six months before I heard them again.â€

â€œWhy was that?â€ asked Darcy.

â€œSurely because I had revolted, rebelled, and worst of all been
frightened. For I believe that just as there is nothing in the world
which so injures oneâ€™s body as fear, so there is nothing that so much
shuts up the soul. I was afraid, you see, of the one thing in the world
which has real existence. No wonder its manifestation was withdrawn.â€

â€œAnd after six months?â€

â€œAfter six months one blessed morning I heard the piping again. I wasnâ€™t
afraid that time. And since then it has grown louder, it has become more
constant. I now hear it often, and I can put myself into such an
attitude towards Nature that the pipes will almost certainly sound. And
never yet have they played the same tune, it is always something new,
something fuller, richer, more complete than before.â€

â€œWhat do you mean by â€˜such an attitude towards Natureâ€™?â€ asked Darcy.

â€œI canâ€™t explain that; but by translating it into a bodily attitude it
is this.â€

Frank sat up for a moment quite straight in his chair, then slowly sunk
back with arms outspread and head drooped.

â€œThat;â€ he said, â€œan effortless attitude, but open, resting, receptive.
It is just that which you must do with your soul.â€

Then he sat up again.

â€œOne word more,â€ he said, â€œand I will bore you no further. Nor unless
you ask me questions shall I talk about it again. You will find me, in
fact, quite sane in my mode of life. Birds and beasts, you will see
behaving somewhat intimately to me, like that moor-hen, but that is all.
I will walk with you, ride with you, play golf with you, and talk with
you on any subject you like. But I wanted you on the threshold to know
what has happened to me. And one thing more will happen.â€

He paused again, and a slight look of fear crossed his eyes.

â€œThere will be a final revelation,â€ he said, â€œa complete and blinding
stroke which will throw open to me, once and for all, the full
knowledge, the full realisation and comprehension that I am one, just as
you are, with life. In reality there is no â€˜me,â€™ no â€˜you,â€™ no â€˜it.â€™
Everything is part of the one and only thing which is life. I know that
that is so, but the realisation of it is not yet mine. But it will be,
and on that day, so I take it, I shall see Pan. It may mean death, the
death of my body, that is, but I donâ€™t care. It may mean immortal,
eternal life lived here and now and for ever. Then having gained that,
ah, my dear Darcy, I shall preach such a gospel of joy, showing myself
as the living proof of the truth, that Puritanism, the dismal religion
of sour faces, shall vanish like a breath of smoke, and be dispersed and
disappear in the sunlit air. But first the full knowledge must be mine.â€

Darcy watched his face narrowly.

â€œYou are afraid of that moment,â€ he said.

Frank smiled at him.

â€œQuite true; you are quick to have seen that. But when it comes I hope I
shall not be afraid.â€

For some little time there was silence; then Darcy rose.

â€œYou have bewitched me, you extraordinary boy,â€ he said. â€œYou have been
telling me a fairy-story, and I find myself saying, â€˜Promise me it is
true.â€™â€

â€œI promise you that,â€ said the other.

â€œAnd I know I shanâ€™t sleep,â€ added Darcy.

Frank looked at him with a sort of mild wonder as if he scarcely
understood.

â€œWell, what does that matter?â€ he said.

â€œI assure you it does. I am wretched unless I sleep.â€

â€œOf course I can make you sleep if I want,â€ said Frank in a rather bored
voice.

â€œWell do.â€

â€œVery good: go to bed. Iâ€™ll come upstairs in ten minutes.â€

Frank busied himself for a little after the other had gone, moving the
table back under the awning of the verandah and quenching the lamp. Then
he went with his quick silent tread upstairs and into Darcyâ€™s room. The
latter was already in bed, but very wide-eyed and wakeful, and Frank
with an amused smile of indulgence, as for a fretful child, sat down on
the edge of the bed.

â€œLook at me,â€ he said, and Darcy looked.

â€œThe birds are sleeping in the brake,â€ said Frank softly, â€œand the winds
are asleep. The sea sleeps, and the tides are but the heaving of its
breast. The stars swing slow, rocked in the great cradle of the Heavens,
and----â€

He stopped suddenly, gently blew out Darcyâ€™s candle, and left him
sleeping.

Morning brought to Darcy a flood of hard common-sense, as clear and
crisp as the sunshine that filled his room. Slowly as he woke he
gathered together the broken threads of the memories of the evening
which had ended, so he told himself, in a trick of common hypnotism.
That accounted for it all; the whole strange talk he had had was under a
spell of suggestion from the extraordinary vivid boy who had once been a
man; all his own excitement, his acceptance of the incredible had been
merely the effect of a stronger, more potent will imposed on his own.
How strong that will was, he guessed from his own instantaneous
obedience to Frankâ€™s suggestion of sleep. And armed with impenetrable
common-sense he came down to breakfast. Frank had already begun, and was
consuming a large plateful of porridge and milk with the most prosaic
and healthy appetite.

â€œSlept well?â€ he asked.

â€œYes, of course. Where did you learn hypnotism?â€

â€œBy the side of the river.â€

â€œYou talked an amazing quantity of nonsense last night,â€ remarked Darcy,
in a voice prickly with reason.

â€œRather. I felt quite giddy. Look, I remembered to order a dreadful
daily paper for you. You can read about money markets or politics or
cricket matches.â€

Darcy looked at him closely. In the morning light Frank looked even
fresher, younger, more vital than he had done the night before, and the
sight of him somehow dinted Darcyâ€™s armour of common-sense.

â€œYou are the most extraordinary fellow I ever saw,â€ he said. â€œI want to
ask you some more questions.â€

â€œAsk away,â€ said Frank.

       *       *       *       *       *

For the next day or two Darcy plied his friend with many questions,
objections and criticisms on the theory of life and gradually got out of
him a coherent and complete account of his experience. In brief then,
Frank believed that â€œby lying naked,â€ as he put it, to the force which
controls the passage of the stars, the breaking of a wave, the budding
of a tree, the love of a youth and maiden, he had succeeded in a way
hitherto undreamed of in possessing himself of the essential principle
of life. Day by day, so he thought, he was getting nearer to, and in
closer union with the great power itself which caused all life to be,
the spirit of nature, of force, or the spirit of God. For himself, he
confessed to what others would call paganism; it was sufficient for him
that there existed a principle of life. He did not worship it, he did
not pray to it, he did not praise it. Some of it existed in all human
beings, just as it existed in trees and animals, to realise and make
living to himself the fact that it was all one, was his sole aim and
object.

Here perhaps Darcy would put in a word of warning.

â€œTake care,â€ he said. â€œTo see Pan meant death, did it not.â€

Frankâ€™s eyebrows would rise at this.

â€œWhat does that matter?â€ he said. â€œTrue, the Greeks were always right,
and they said so, but there is another possibility. For the nearer I get
to it, the more living, the more vital and young I become.â€

â€œWhat then do you expect the final revelation will do for you?â€

â€œI have told you,â€ said he. â€œIt will make me immortal.â€

But it was not so much from speech and argument that Darcy grew to grasp
his friendâ€™s conception, as from the ordinary conduct of his life. They
were passing, for instance, one morning down the village street, when an
old woman, very bent and decrepit, but with an extraordinary
cheerfulness of face, hobbled out from her cottage. Frank instantly
stopped when he saw her.

â€œYou old darling! How goes it all?â€ he said.

But she did not answer, her dim old eyes were rivetted on his face; she
seemed to drink in like a thirsty creature the beautiful radiance which
shone there. Suddenly she put her two withered old hands on his
shoulders.

â€œYouâ€™re just the sunshine itself,â€ she said, and he kissed her and
passed on.

But scarcely a hundred yards further a strange contradiction of such
tenderness occurred. A child running along the path towards them fell on
its face, and set up a dismal cry of fright and pain. A look of horror
came into Frankâ€™s eyes, and, putting his fingers in his ears, he fled at
full speed down the street, and did not pause till he was out of
hearing. Darcy, having ascertained that the child was not really hurt,
followed him in bewilderment.

â€œAre you without pity then?â€ he asked.

Frank shook his head impatiently.

â€œCanâ€™t you see?â€ he asked. â€œCanâ€™t you understand that that sort of
thing, pain, anger, anything unlovely throws me back, retards the coming
of the great hour! Perhaps when it comes I shall be able to piece that
side of life on to the other, on to the true religion of joy. At present
I canâ€™t.â€

â€œBut the old woman. Was she not ugly?â€

Frankâ€™s radiance gradually returned.

â€œAh, no. She was like me. She longed for joy, and knew it when she saw
it, the old darling.â€

Another question suggested itself.

â€œThen what about Christianity?â€ asked Darcy.

â€œI canâ€™t accept it. I canâ€™t believe in any creed of which the central
doctrine is that God who is Joy should have had to suffer. Perhaps it
was so; in some inscrutable way I believe it may have been so, but I
donâ€™t understand how it was possible. So I leave it alone; my affair is
joy.â€

They had come to the weir above the village, and the thunder of riotous
cool water was heavy in the air. Trees dipped into the translucent
stream with slender trailing branches, and the meadow where they stood
was starred with midsummer blossomings. Larks shot up carolling into the
crystal dome of blue, and a thousand voices of June sang round them.
Frank, bare-headed as was his wont, with his coat slung over his arm and
his shirt sleeves rolled up above the elbow, stood there like some
beautiful wild animal with eyes half-shut and mouth half-open, drinking
in the scented warmth of the air. Then suddenly he flung himself face
downwards on the grass at the edge of the stream, burying his face in
the daisies and cowslips, and lay stretched there in wide-armed ecstasy,
with his long fingers pressing and stroking the dewy herbs of the field.
Never before had Darcy seen him thus fully possessed by his idea; his
caressing fingers, his half-buried face pressed close to the grass, even
the clothed lines of his figure were instinct with a vitality that
somehow was different from that of other men. And some faint glow from
it reached Darcy, some thrill, some vibration from that charged
recumbent body passed to him, and for a moment he understood as he had
not understood before, despite his persistent questions and the candid
answers they received, how real, and how realised by Frank, his idea
was.

Then suddenly the muscles in Frankâ€™s neck became stiff and alert, and he
half-raised his head.

â€œThe Pan-pipes, the Pan-pipes,â€ he whispered. â€œClose, oh, so close.â€

Very slowly, as if a sudden movement might interrupt the melody, he
raised himself and leaned on the elbow of his bent arm. His eyes opened
wider, the lower lids drooped as if he focussed his eyes on something
very far away, and the smile on his face broadened and quivered like
sunlight on still water, till the exultance of its happiness was
scarcely human. So he remained motionless and rapt for some minutes,
then the look of listening died from his face, and he bowed his head
satisfied.

â€œAh, that was good,â€ he said. â€œHow is it possible you did not hear? Oh,
you poor fellow! Did you really hear nothing?â€

A week of this outdoor and stimulating life did wonders in restoring to
Darcy the vigour and health which his weeks of fever had filched from
him, and as his normal activity and higher pressure of vitality
returned, he seemed to himself to fall even more under the spell which
the miracle of Frankâ€™s youth cast over him. Twenty times a day he found
himself saying to himself suddenly at the end of some ten minutesâ€™
silent resistance to the absurdity of Frankâ€™s idea: â€œBut it isnâ€™t
possible; it canâ€™t be possible,â€ and from the fact of his having to
assure himself so frequently of this, he knew that he was struggling and
arguing with a conclusion which already had taken root in his mind. For
in any case a visible living miracle confronted him, since it was
equally impossible that this youth, this boy, trembling on the verge of
manhood, was thirty-five. Yet such was the fact.

July was ushered in by a couple of days of blustering and fretful rain,
and Darcy, unwilling to risk a chill, kept to the house. But to Frank
this weeping change of weather seemed to have no bearing on the
behaviour of man, and he spent his days exactly as he did under the suns
of June, lying in his hammock, stretched on the dripping grass, or
making huge rambling excursions into the forest, the birds hopping from
tree to tree after him, to return in the evening, drenched and soaked,
but with the same unquenchable flame of joy burning within him.

â€œCatch cold?â€ he would ask, â€œIâ€™ve forgotten how to do it, I think. I
suppose it makes oneâ€™s body more sensible always to sleep out-of-doors.
People who live indoors always remind me of something peeled and
skinless.â€

â€œDo you mean to say you slept out-of-doors last night in that deluge?â€
asked Darcy. â€œAnd where, may I ask?â€

Frank thought a moment.

â€œI slept in the hammock till nearly dawn,â€ he said. â€œFor I remember the
light blinked in the east when I awoke. Then I went--where did I go--oh,
yes, to the meadow where the Pan-pipes sounded so close a week ago. You
were with me, do you remember? But I always have a rug if it is wet.â€

And he went whistling upstairs.

Somehow that little touch, his obvious effort to recall where he had
slept, brought strangely home to Darcy the wonderful romance of which he
was the still half-incredulous beholder. Sleep till close on dawn in a
hammock, then the tramp--or probably scamper--underneath the windy and
weeping heavens to the remote and lonely meadow by the weir! The picture
of other such nights rose before him; Frank sleeping perhaps by the
bathing-place under the filtered twilight of the stars, or the white
blaze of moon-shine, a stir and awakening at some dead hour, perhaps a
space of silent wide-eyed thought, and then awandering through the
hushed woods to some other dormitory, alone with his happiness, alone
with the joy and the life that suffused and enveloped him, without other
thought or desire or aim except the hourly and never-ceasing communion
with the joy of nature.

They were in the middle of dinner that night, talking on indifferent
subjects, when Darcy suddenly broke off in the middle of a sentence.

â€œIâ€™ve got it,â€ he said. â€œAt last Iâ€™ve got it.â€

â€œCongratulate you,â€ said Frank. â€œBut what?â€

â€œThe radical unsoundness of your idea. It is this: â€˜All Nature from
highest to lowest is full, crammed full of suffering; every living
organism in nature preys on another, yet in your aim to get close to,
to be one with nature, you leave suffering altogether out; you run away
from it, you refuse to recognise it. And you are waiting, you say, for
the final revelation.â€

Frankâ€™s brow clouded slightly.

â€œWell,â€ he asked, rather wearily.

â€œCannot you guess then when the final revelation will be? In joy you are
supreme, I grant you that; I did not know a man could be so master of
it. You have learned perhaps practically all that nature can teach. And
if, as you think, the final revelation is coming to you, it will be the
revelation of horror, suffering, death, pain in all its hideous forms.
Suffering does exist: you hate it and fear it.â€

Frank held up his hand.

â€œStop; let me think,â€ he said.

There was silence for a long minute.

â€œThat never struck me,â€ he said at length. â€œIt is possible that what you
suggest is true. Does the sight of Pan mean that, do you think? Is it
that nature, take it altogether, suffers horribly, suffers to a hideous
inconceivable extent? Shall I be shown all the suffering?â€

He got up and came round to where Darcy sat.

â€œIf it is so, so be it,â€ he said. â€œBecause, my dear fellow, I am near,
so splendidly near to the final revelation. To-day the pipes have
sounded almost without pause. I have even heard the rustle in the
bushes, I believe, of Panâ€™s coming. I have seen, yes, I saw to-day, the
bushes pushed aside as if by a hand, and piece of a face, not human,
peered through. But I was not frightened, at least I did not run away
this time.â€

He took a turn up to the window and back again.

â€œYes, there is suffering all through,â€ he said, â€œand I have left it all
out of my search. Perhaps, as you say, the revelation will be that. And
in that case, it will be good-bye. I have gone on one line. I shall have
gone too far along one road, without having explored the other. But I
canâ€™t go back now. I wouldnâ€™t if I could; not a step would I retrace! In
any case, whatever the revelation is, it will be God. Iâ€™m sure of that.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

The rainy weather soon passed, and with the return of the sun Darcy
again joined Frank in long rambling days. It grew extraordinarily
hotter, and with the fresh bursting of life, after the rain, Frankâ€™s
vitality seemed to blaze higher and higher. Then, as is the habit of the
English weather, one evening clouds began to bank themselves up in the
west, the sun went down in a glare of coppery thunder-rack, and the
whole earth broiling under an unspeakable oppression and sultriness
paused and panted for the storm. After sunset the remote fires of
lightning began to wink and flicker on the horizon, but when bed-time
came the storm seemed to have moved no nearer, though a very low
unceasing noise of thunder was audible. Weary and oppressed by the
stress of the day, Darcy fell at once into a heavy uncomforting sleep.

He woke suddenly into full consciousness, with the din of some appalling
explosion of thunder in his ears, and sat up in bed with racing heart.
Then for a moment, as he recovered himself from the panic-land which
lies between sleeping and waking, there was silence, except for the
steady hissing of rain on the shrubs outside his window. But suddenly
that silence was shattered and shredded into fragments by a scream from
somewhere close at hand outside in the black garden, a scream of supreme
and despairing terror. Again and once again it shrilled up, and then a
babble of awful words was interjected. A quivering sobbing voice that he
knew, said:

â€œMy God, oh, my God; oh, Christ!â€

And then followed a little mocking, bleating laugh. Then was silence
again; only the rain hissed on the shrubs.

All this was but the affair of a moment, and without pause either to put
on clothes or light a candle, Darcy was already fumbling at his
door-handle. Even as he opened it he met a terror-stricken face outside,
that of the man-servant who carried a light.

â€œDid you hear?â€ he asked.

The manâ€™s face was bleached to a dull shining whiteness.

â€œYes, sir,â€ he said. â€œIt was the masterâ€™s voice.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

Together they hurried down the stairs, and through the dining-room where
an orderly table for breakfast had already been laid, and out on to the
terrace. The rain for the moment had been utterly stayed, as if the tap
of the heavens had been turned off, and under the lowering black sky,
not quite dark, since the moon rode somewhere serene behind the
conglomerated thunder-clouds, Darcy stumbled into the garden, followed
by the servant with the candle. The monstrous leaping shadow of himself
was cast before him on the lawn; lost and wandering odours of rose and
lily and damp earth were thick about him, but more pungent was some
sharp and acrid smell that suddenly reminded him of a certain chalet in
which he had once taken refuge in the Alps. In the blackness of the hazy
light from the sky, and the vague tossing of the candle behind him, he
saw that the hammock in which Frank so often lay was tenanted. A gleam
of white shirt was there, as if a man sitting up in it, but across that
there was an obscure dark shadow, and as he approached the acrid odour
grew more intense.

He was now only some few yards away, when suddenly the black shadow
seemed to jump into the air, then came down with tappings of hard hoofs
on the brick path that ran down the pergola, and with frolicsome
skippings galloped off into the bushes. When that was gone Darcy could
see quite clearly that a shirted figure sat up in the hammock. For one
moment, from sheer terror of the unseen, he hung on his step, and the
servant joining him they walked together to the hammock.

It was Frank. He was in shirt and trousers only, and he sat up with
braced arms. For one half-second he stared at them, his face a mask of
horrible contorted terror. His upper lip was drawn back so that the gums
of the teeth appeared, and his eyes were focussed not on the two who
approached him but on something quite close to him; his nostrils were
widely expanded, as if he panted for breath, and terror incarnate and
repulsion and deathly anguish ruled dreadful lines on his smooth cheeks
and forehead. Then even as they looked the body sank backwards, and the
ropes of the hammock wheezed and strained.

Darcy lifted him out and carried him indoors. Once he thought there was
a faint convulsive stir of the limbs that lay with so dead a weight in
his arms, but when they got inside, there was no trace of life. But the
look of supreme terror and agony of fear had gone from his face, a boy
tired with play but still smiling in his sleep was the burden he laid on
the floor. His eyes had closed, and the beautiful mouth lay in smiling
curves, even as when a few mornings ago, in the meadow by the weir, it
had quivered to the music of the unheard melody of Panâ€™s pipes. Then
they looked further.

Frank had come back from his bathe before dinner that night in his usual
costume of shirt and trousers only. He had not dressed, and during
dinner, so Darcy remembered, he had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt
to above the elbow. Later, as they sat and talked after dinner on the
close sultriness of the evening, he had unbuttoned the front of his
shirt to let what little breath of wind there was play on his skin. The
sleeves were rolled up now, the front of the shirt was unbuttoned, and
on his arms and on the brown skin of his chest were strange
discolorations which grew momently more clear and defined, till they saw
that the marks were pointed prints, as if caused by the hoofs of some
monstrous goat that had leaped and stamped upon him.




BETWEEN THE LIGHTS


The day had been one unceasing fall of snow from sunrise until the
gradual withdrawal of the vague white light outside indicated that the
sun had set again. But as usual at this hospitable and delightful house
of Everard Chandler where I often spent Christmas, and was spending it
now, there had been no lack of entertainment, and the hours had passed
with a rapidity that had surprised us. A short billiard tournament had
filled up the time between breakfast and lunch, with Badminton and the
morning papers for those who were temporarily not engaged, while
afterwards, the interval till teatime had been occupied by the majority
of the party in a huge game of hide-and-seek all over the house, barring
the billiard-room, which was sanctuary for any who desired peace. But
few had done that; the enchantment of Christmas, I must suppose, had,
like some spell, made children of us again, and it was with palsied
terror and trembling misgivings that we had tip-toed up and down the dim
passages, from any corner of which some wild screaming form might dart
out on us. Then, wearied with exercise and emotion, we had assembled
again for tea in the hall, a room of shadows and panels on which the
light from the wide open fireplace, where there burned a divine mixture
of peat and logs, flickered and grew bright again on the walls. Then, as
was proper, ghost-stories, for the narration of which the electric light
was put out, so that the listeners might conjecture anything they
pleased to be lurking in the corners, succeeded, and we vied with each
other in blood, bones, skeletons, armour and shrieks. I had just given
my contribution, and was reflecting with some complacency that probably
the worst was now known, when Everard, who had not yet administered to
the horror of his guests, spoke. He was sitting opposite me in the full
blaze of the fire, looking, after the illness he had gone through during
the autumn, still rather pale and delicate. All the same he had been
among the boldest and best in the exploration of dark places that
afternoon, and the look on his face now rather startled me.

â€œNo, I donâ€™t mind that sort of thing,â€ he said. â€œThe paraphernalia of
ghosts has become somehow rather hackneyed, and when I hear of screams
and skeletons I feel I am on familiar ground, and can at least hide my
head under the bed-clothes.â€

â€œAh, but the bed-clothes were twitched away by my skeleton,â€ said I, in
self-defence.

â€œI know, but I donâ€™t even mind that. Why, there are seven, eight
skeletons in this room now, covered with blood and skin and other
horrors. No, the nightmares of oneâ€™s childhood were the really
frightening things, because they were vague. There was the true
atmosphere of horror about them because one didnâ€™t know what one feared.
Now if one could recapture that----â€

Mrs Chandler got quickly out of her seat.

â€œOh, Everard,â€ she said, â€œsurely you donâ€™t wish to recapture it again. I
should have thought once was enough.â€

This was enchanting. A chorus of invitation asked him to proceed: the
real true ghost-story first-hand, which was what seemed to be indicated,
was too precious a thing to lose.

Everard laughed. â€œNo, dear, I donâ€™t want to recapture it again at all,â€
he said to his wife. Then to us: â€œBut really the--well, the nightmare
perhaps, to which I was referring, is of the vaguest and most
unsatisfactory kind. It has no apparatus about it at all. You will
probably all say that it was nothing, and wonder why I was frightened.
But I was; it frightened me out of my wits. And I only just saw
something, without being able to swear what it was, and heard something
which might have been a falling stone.â€

â€œAnyhow tell us about the falling stone,â€ said I.

There was a stir of movement about the circle round the fire, and the
movement was not of purely physical order. It was as if--this is only
what I personally felt--it was as if the childish gaiety of the hours
we had passed that day was suddenly withdrawn; we had jested on certain
subjects, we had played hide-and-seek with all the power of earnestness
that was in us. But now--so it seemed to me--there was going to be real
hide-and-seek, real terrors were going to lurk in dark corners, or if
not real terrors, terrors so convincing as to assume the garb of
reality, were going to pounce on us. And Mrs Chandlerâ€™s exclamation as
she sat down again, â€œOh, Everard, wonâ€™t it excite you?â€ tended in any
case to excite us. The room still remained in dubious darkness except
for the sudden lights disclosed on the walls by the leaping flames on
the hearth, and there was wide field for conjecture as to what might
lurk in the dim corners. Everard, moreover, who had been sitting in
bright light before, was banished by the extinction of some flaming log
into the shadows. A voice alone spoke to us, as he sat back in his low
chair, a voice rather slow but very distinct.

â€œLast year,â€ he said, â€œon the twenty-fourth of December, we were down
here, as usual, Amy and I, for Christmas. Several of you who are here
now were here then. Three or four of you at least.â€

I was one of these, but like the others kept silence, for the
identification, so it seemed to me, was not asked for. And he went on
again without a pause.

â€œThose of you who were here then,â€ he said, â€œand are here now, will
remember how very warm it was this day year. You will remember, too,
that we played croquet that day on the lawn. It was perhaps a little
cold for croquet, and we played it rather in order to be able to
say--with sound evidence to back the statement--that we had done so.â€

Then he turned and addressed the whole little circle.

â€œWe played ties of half-games,â€ he said, â€œjust as we have played
billiards to-day, and it was certainly as warm on the lawn then as it
was in the billiard-room this morning directly after breakfast, while
to-day I should not wonder if there was three feet of snow outside.
More, probably; listen.â€

A sudden draught fluted in the chimney, and the fire flared up as the
current of air caught it. The wind also drove the snow against the
windows, and as he said â€œListen,â€ we heard a soft scurry of the falling
flakes against the panes, like the soft tread of many little people who
stepped lightly, but with the persistence of multitudes who were
flocking to some rendezvous. Hundreds of little feet seemed to be
gathering outside; only the glass kept them out. And of the eight
skeletons present four or five anyhow turned and looked at the windows.
These were small-paned, with leaden bars. On the leaden bars little
heaps of snow had accumulated, but there was nothing else to be seen.

â€œYes, last Christmas Eve was very warm and sunny,â€ went on Everard. â€œWe
had had no frost that autumn, and a temerarious dahlia was still in
flower. I have always thought that it must have been mad.â€

He paused a moment.

â€œAnd I wonder if I were not mad too,â€ he added.

No one interrupted him; there was something arresting, I must suppose,
in what he was saying; it chimed in anyhow with the hide-and-seek, with
the suggestions of the lonely snow. Mrs Chandler had sat down again, but
I heard her stir in her chair. But never was there a gay party so
reduced as we had been in the last five minutes. Instead of laughing at
ourselves for playing silly games, we were all taking a serious game
seriously.

â€œAnyhow I was sitting out,â€ he said to me, â€œwhile you and my wife played
your half-game of croquet. Then it struck me that it was not so warm as
I had supposed, because quite suddenly I shivered. And shivering I
looked up. But I did not see you and her playing croquet at all. I saw
something which had no relation to you and her--at least I hope not.â€

Now the angler lands his fish, the stalker kills his stag, and the
speaker holds his audience. And as the fish is gaffed, and as the stag
is shot, so were we held. There was no getting away till he had finished
with us.

â€œYou all know the croquet lawn,â€ he said, â€œand how it is bounded all
round by a flower border with a brick wall behind it, through which,
you will remember, there is only one gate. Well, I looked up and saw
that the lawn--I could for one moment see it was still a lawn--was
shrinking, and the walls closing in upon it. As they closed in too, they
grew higher, and simultaneously the light began to fade and be sucked
from the sky, till it grew quite dark overhead and only a glimmer of
light came in through the gate.

â€œThere was, as I told you, a dahlia in flower that day, and as this
dreadful darkness and bewilderment came over me, I remember that my eyes
sought it in a kind of despair, holding on, as it were, to any familiar
object. But it was no longer a dahlia, and for the red of its petals I
saw only the red of some feeble firelight. And at that moment the
hallucination was complete. I was no longer sitting on the lawn watching
croquet, but I was in a low-roofed room, something like a cattle-shed,
but round. Close above my head, though I was sitting down, ran rafters
from wall to wall. It was nearly dark, but a little light came in from
the door opposite to me, which seemed to lead into a passage that
communicated with the exterior of the place. Little, however, of the
wholesome air came into this dreadful den; the atmosphere was oppressive
and foul beyond all telling, it was as if for years it had been the
place of some human menagerie, and for those years had been uncleaned
and unsweetened by the winds of heaven. Yet that oppressiveness was
nothing to the awful horror of the place from the view of the spirit.
Some dreadful atmosphere of crime and abomination dwelt heavy in it, its
denizens, whoever they were, were scarce human, so it seemed to me, and
though men and women, were akin more to the beasts of the field. And in
addition there was present to me some sense of the weight of years; I
had been taken and thrust down into some epoch of dim antiquity.â€

He paused a moment, and the fire on the hearth leaped up for a second
and then died down again. But in that gleam I saw that all faces were
turned to Everard, and that all wore some look of dreadful expectancy.
Certainly I felt it myself, and waited in a sort of shrinking horror for
what was coming.

â€œAs I told you,â€ he continued, â€œwhere there had been that unseasonable
dahlia, there now burned a dim firelight, and my eyes were drawn there.
Shapes were gathered round it; what they were I could not at first see.
Then perhaps my eyes got more accustomed to the dusk, or the fire burned
better, for I perceived that they were of human form, but very small,
for when one rose, with a horrible chattering, to his feet, his head was
still some inches off the low roof. He was dressed in a sort of shirt
that came to his knees, but his arms were bare and covered with hair.
Then the gesticulation and chattering increased, and I knew that they
were talking about me, for they kept pointing in my direction. At that
my horror suddenly deepened, for I became aware that I was powerless and
could not move hand or foot; a helpless, nightmare impotence had
possession of me. I could not lift a finger or turn my head. And in the
paralysis of that fear I tried to scream, but not a sound could I utter.

â€œAll this I suppose took place with the instantaneousness of a dream,
for at once, and without transition, the whole thing had vanished, and I
was back on the lawn again, while the stroke for which my wife was
aiming was still unplayed. But my face was dripping with perspiration,
and I was trembling all over.

â€œNow you may all say that I had fallen asleep, and had a sudden
nightmare. That may be so; but I was conscious of no sense of sleepiness
before, and I was conscious of none afterwards. It was as if someone had
held a book before me, whisked the pages open for a second and closed
them again.â€

Somebody, I donâ€™t know who, got up from his chair with a sudden movement
that made me start, and turned on the electric light. I do not mind
confessing that I was rather glad of this.

Everard laughed.

â€œReally I feel like Hamlet in the play-scene,â€ he said, â€œand as if there
was a guilty uncle present. Shall I go on?â€

I donâ€™t think anyone replied, and he went on:

â€œWell, let us say for the moment that it was not a dream exactly, but a
hallucination. Whichever it was, in any case it haunted me; for months,
I think, it was never quite out of my mind, but lingered somewhere in
the dusk of consciousness, sometimes sleeping quietly, so to speak, but
sometimes stirring in its sleep. It was no good my telling myself that I
was disquieting myself in vain, for it was as if something had actually
entered into my very soul, as if some seed of horror had been planted
there. And as the weeks went on the seed began to sprout, so that I
could no longer even tell myself that that vision had been a momentâ€™s
disorderment only. I canâ€™t say that it actually affected my health. I
did not, as far as I know, sleep or eat insufficiently, but morning
after morning I used to wake, not gradually and through pleasant dozings
into full consciousness, but with absolute suddenness, and find myself
plunged in an abyss of despair. Often too, eating or drinking, I used to
pause and wonder if it was worth while.

â€œEventually I told two people about my trouble, hoping that perhaps the
mere communication would help matters, hoping also, but very distantly,
that though I could not believe at present that digestion or the
obscurities of the nervous system were at fault, a doctor by some simple
dose might convince me of it. In other words I told my wife, who laughed
at me, and my doctor who laughed also, and assured me that my health
was quite unnecessarily robust. At the same time he suggested that
change of air and scene does wonders for the delusions that exist merely
in the imagination. He also told me, in answer to a direct question,
that he would stake his reputation on the certainty that I was not going
mad.

â€œWell, we went up to London as usual for the season, and though nothing
whatever occurred to remind me in any way of that single moment on
Christmas Eve, the reminding was seen to all right, the moment itself
took care of that, for instead of fading as is the way of sleeping or
waking dreams, it grew every day more vivid, and ate, so to speak, like
some corrosive acid into my mind, etching itself there. And to London
succeeded Scotland.

â€œI took last year for the first time a small forest up in Sutherland,
called Glen Callan, very remote and wild, but affording excellent
stalking. It was not far from the sea, and the gillies used always to
warn me to carry a compass on the hill, because sea-mists were liable to
come up with frightful rapidity, and there was always a danger of being
caught by one, and of having perhaps to wait hours till it cleared
again. This at first I always used to do, but, as every one knows, any
precaution that one takes which continues to be unjustified gets
gradually relaxed, and at the end of a few weeks, since the weather had
been uniformly clear, it was natural that, as often as not, my compass
remained at home.

â€œOne day the stalk took me on to a part of my ground that I had seldom
been on before, a very high table-land on the limit of my forest, which
went down very steeply on one side to a loch that lay below it, and on
the other, by gentler gradations, to the river that came from the loch,
six miles below which stood the lodge. The wind had necessitated our
climbing up--or so my stalker had insisted--not by the easier way, but
up the crags from the loch. I had argued the point with him, for it
seemed to me that it was impossible that the deer could get our scent if
we went by the more natural path, but he still held to his opinion, and
therefore, since after all this was his part of the job, I yielded. A
dreadful climb we had of it, over big boulders with deep holes in
between, masked by clumps of heather, so that a wary eye and a prodding
stick were necessary for each step if one wished to avoid broken bones.
Adders also literally swarmed in the heather; we must have seen a dozen
at least on our way up, and adders are a beast for which I have no
manner of use. But a couple of hours saw us to the top, only to find
that the stalker had been utterly at fault, and that the deer must quite
infallibly have got wind of us, if they had remained in the place where
we last saw them. That, when we could spy the ground again, we saw had
happened; in any case they had gone. The man insisted the wind had
changed, a palpably stupid excuse, and I wondered at that moment what
other reason he had--for reason I felt sure there must be--for not
wishing to take what would clearly now have been a better route. But
this piece of bad management did not spoil our luck, for within an hour
we had spied more deer, and about two oâ€™clock I got a shot, killing a
heavy stag. Then sitting on the heather I ate lunch, and enjoyed a
well-earned bask and smoke in the sun. The pony meantime had been
saddled with the stag, and was plodding homewards.

â€œThe morning had been extraordinarily warm, with a little wind blowing
off the sea, which lay a few miles off sparkling beneath a blue haze,
and all morning in spite of our abominable climb I had had an extreme
sense of peace, so much so that several times I had probed my mind, so
to speak, to find if the horror still lingered there. But I could
scarcely get any response from it. Never since Christmas had I been so
free of fear, and it was with a great sense of repose, both physical and
spiritual, that I lay looking up into the blue sky, watching my
smoke-whorls curl slowly away into nothingness. But I was not allowed to
take my ease long, for Sandy came and begged that I would move. The
weather had changed, he said, the wind had shifted again, and he wanted
me to be off this high ground and on the path again as soon as possible,
because it looked to him as if a sea-mist would presently come up.

â€œâ€˜And yonâ€™s a bad place to get down in the mist,â€™ he added, nodding
towards the crags we had come up.

â€œI looked at the man in amazement, for to our right lay a gentle slope
down on to the river, and there was now no possible reason for again
tackling those hideous rocks up which we had climbed this morning. More
than ever I was sure he had some secret reason for not wishing to go the
obvious way. But about one thing he was certainly right, the mist was
coming up from the sea, and I felt in my pocket for the compass, and
found I had forgotten to bring it.

â€œThen there followed a curious scene which lost us time that we could
really ill afford to waste, I insisting on going down by the way that
common-sense directed, he imploring me to take his word for it that the
crags were the better way. Eventually, I marched off to the easier
descent, and told him not to argue any more but follow. What annoyed me
about him was that he would only give the most senseless reasons for
preferring the crags. There were mossy places, he said, on the way I
wished to go, a thing patently false, since the summer had been one
spell of unbroken weather; or it was longer, also obviously untrue; or
there were so many vipers about. But seeing that none of these arguments
produced any effect, at last he desisted, and came after me in silence.

â€œWe were not yet half down when the mist was upon us, shooting up from
the valley like the broken water of a wave, and in three minutes we were
enveloped in a cloud of fog so thick that we could barely see a dozen
yards in front of us. It was therefore another cause for
self-congratulation that we were not now, as we should otherwise have
been, precariously clambering on the face of those crags up which we had
come with such difficulty in the morning, and as I rather prided myself
on my powers of generalship in the matter of direction, I continued
leading, feeling sure that before long we should strike the track by the
river. More than all, the absolute freedom from fear elated me; since
Christmas I had not known the instinctive joy of that; I felt like a
school-boy home for the holidays. But the mist grew thicker and thicker,
and whether it was that real rain-clouds had formed above it, or that it
was of an extraordinary density itself, I got wetter in the next hour
than I have ever been before or since. The wet seemed to penetrate the
skin, and chill the very bones. And still there was no sign of the track
for which I was making. Behind me, muttering to himself, followed the
stalker, but his arguments and protestations were dumb, and it seemed as
if he kept close to me, as if afraid.

â€œNow there are many unpleasant companions in this world; I would not for
instance care to be on the hill with a drunkard or a maniac, but worse
than either, I think, is a frightened man, because his trouble is
infectious, and, insensibly, I began to be afraid of being frightened
too. From that it is but a short step to fear. Other perplexities too
beset us. At one time we seemed to be walking on flat ground, at another
I felt sure we were climbing again, whereas all the time we ought to
have been descending, unless we had missed the way very badly indeed.
Also, for the month was October, it was beginning to get dark, and it
was with a sense of relief that I remembered that the full moon would
rise soon after sunset. But it had grown very much colder, and soon,
instead of rain, we found we were walking through a steady fall of snow.

â€œThings were pretty bad, but then for the moment they seemed to mend,
for, far away to the left, I suddenly heard the brawling of the river.
It should, it is true, have been straight in front of me and we were
perhaps a mile out of our way, but this was better than the blind
wandering of the last hour, and turning to the left, I walked towards
it. But before I had gone a hundred yards, I heard a sudden choked cry
behind me, and just saw Sandyâ€™s form flying as if in terror of pursuit,
into the mists. I called to him but got no reply, and heard only the
spurned stones of his running. What had frightened him I had no idea,
but certainly with his disappearance, the infection of his fear
disappeared also, and I went on, I may almost say, with gaiety. On the
moment, however, I saw a sudden well-defined blackness in front of me,
and before I knew what I was doing I was half stumbling, half walking up
a very steep grass slope.

â€œDuring the last few minutes the wind had got up, and the driving snow
was peculiarly uncomfortable, but there had been a certain consolation
in thinking that the wind would soon disperse these mists, and I had
nothing more than a moonlight walk home. But as I paused on this slope,
I became aware of two things, one, that the blackness in front of me was
very close, the other that, whatever it was, it sheltered me from the
snow. So I climbed on a dozen yards into its friendly shelter, for it
seemed to me to be friendly.

â€œA wall some twelve feet high crowned the slope, and exactly where I
struck it there was a hole in it, or door rather, through which a little
light appeared. Wondering at this I pushed on, bending down, for the
passage was very low, and in a dozen yards came out on the other side.
Just as I did this the sky suddenly grew lighter, the wind, I suppose,
having dispersed the mists, and the moon, though not yet visible through
the flying skirts of cloud, made sufficient illumination.

â€œI was in a circular enclosure, and above me there projected from the
walls some four feet from the ground, broken stones which must have been
intended to support a floor. Then simultaneously two things occurred.

â€œThe whole of my nine monthsâ€™ terror came back to me, for I saw that the
vision in the garden was fulfilled, and at the same moment I saw
stealing towards me a little figure as of a man, but only about three
foot six in height. That my eyes told me; my ears told me that he
stumbled on a stone; my nostrils told me that the air I breathed was of
an overpowering foulness, and my soul told me that it was sick unto
death. I think I tried to scream, but could not, I know I tried to move
and could not. And it crept closer.

â€œThen I suppose the terror which held me spellbound so spurred me that I
must move, for next moment I heard a cry break from my lips, and was
stumbling through the passage. I made one leap of it down the grass
slope, and ran as I hope never to have to run again. What direction I
took I did not pause to consider, so long as I put distance between me
and that place. Luck, however, favoured me, and before long I struck the
track by the river, and an hour afterwards reached the lodge.

â€œNext day I developed a chill, and as you know pneumonia laid me on my
back for six weeks.

â€œWell, that is my story, and there are many explanations. You may say
that I fell asleep on the lawn, and was reminded of that by finding
myself, under discouraging circumstances, in an old Pictsâ€™ castle, where
a sheep or a goat that, like myself, had taken shelter from the storm,
was moving about. Yes, there are hundreds of ways in which you may
explain it. But the coincidence was an odd one, and those who believe in
second sight might find an instance of their hobby in it.â€

â€œAnd that is all?â€ I asked.

â€œYes, it was nearly too much for me. I think the dressing-bell has
sounded.â€




OUTSIDE THE DOOR


The rest of the small party staying with my friend Geoffrey Aldwych in
the charming old house which he had lately bought at a little village
north of Sheringham on the Norfolk coast had drifted away soon after
dinner to bridge and billiards, and Mrs Aldwych and myself had for the
time been left alone in the drawing-room, seated one on each side of a
small round table which we had very patiently and unsuccessfully been
trying to turn. But such pressure, psychical or physical, as we had put
upon it, though of the friendliest and most encouraging nature had not
overcome in the smallest degree the very slight inertia which so small
an object might have been supposed to possess, and it had remained as
fixed as the most constant of the stars. No tremor even had passed
through its slight and spindle-like legs. In consequence we had, after a
really considerable period of patient endeavour, left it to its wooden
repose, and proceeded to theorise about psychical matters instead, with
no stupid table to contradict in practice all our ideas on the subject.

This I had added with a certain bitterness born of failure, for if we
could not move so insignificant an object, we might as well give up all
idea of moving anything. But hardly were the words out of my mouth when
there came from the abandoned table, a single peremptory rap, loud and
rather startling.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ I asked.

â€œOnly a rap,â€ said she. â€œI thought something would happen before long.â€

â€œAnd do you really think that is a spirit rapping?â€ I asked.

â€œOh dear no. I donâ€™t think it has anything whatever to do with spirits.â€

â€œMore perhaps with the very dry weather we have been having. Furniture
often cracks like that in the summer.â€

Now this, in point of fact, was not quite the case. Neither in summer
nor in winter have I heard ever furniture crack as the table had
cracked, for the sound, whatever it was, did not at all resemble the
husky creak of contracting wood. It was a loud sharp crack like the
smart concussion of one hard object with another.

â€œNo, I donâ€™t think it had much to do with dry weather either,â€ said she
smiling. â€œI think, if you wish to know, that it was the direct result of
our attempt to turn the table. Does that sound nonsense?â€

â€œAt present, yes,â€ said I, â€œthough I have no doubt that if you tried you
could make it sound sense. There is, I notice, a certain plausibility
about you and your theories----â€

â€œNow you are being merely personal,â€ she observed.

â€œFor the good motive, to goad you into explanations and enlargements.
Please go on.â€

â€œLet us stroll outside, then,â€ said she, â€œand sit in the garden, if you
are sure you prefer my plausibilities to bridge. It is deliciously warm,
and----â€

â€œAnd the darkness will be more suitable for the propagation of psychical
phenomena. As at sÃ©ances,â€ said I.

â€œOh, there is nothing psychical about my plausibilities,â€ said she. â€œThe
phenomena I mean are purely physical, according to my theory.â€

So we wandered out into the transparent half light of multitudinous
stars. The last crimson feather of sunset, which had hovered long in the
West, had been blown away with the breath of the night wind, and the
moon, which would presently rise, had not yet cut the dim horizon of the
sea, which lay very quiet, breathing gently in its sleep with stir of
whispering ripples. Across the dark velvet of the close-cropped lawn,
which stretched seawards from the house, blew a little breeze full of
the savour of salt and the freshness of night, with, every now and then,
a hint so subtly conveyed as to be scarcely perceptible of its travel
across the sleeping fragrance of drowsy garden-beds, over which the
white moths hovered seeking their night-honey. The house itself, with
its two battlemented towers of Elizabethan times, gleamed with many
windows, and we passed out of sight of it, and into the shadow of a
box-hedge, clipped into shapes and monstrous fantasies, and found chairs
by the striped tent at the top of the sheltered bowling-alley.

â€œAnd this is all very plausible,â€ said I. â€œTheories, if you please, at
length, and, if possible, a full length illustration also.â€

â€œBy which you mean a ghost-story, or something to that effect?â€

â€œPrecisely: and, without presuming to dictate, if possible, first-hand.â€

â€œOddly enough, I can supply that also,â€ said she. â€œSo first I will tell
you my general theory, and follow it by a story that seems to bear it
out. It happened to me, and it happened here.â€

â€œI am sure it will fill the bill,â€ said I.

She paused a moment while I lit a cigarette, and then began in her very
clear, pleasant voice. She has the most lucid voice I know, and to me
sitting there in the deep-dyed dusk, the words seemed the very
incarnation of clarity, for they dropped into the still quiet of the
darkness, undisturbed by impressions conveyed to other senses.

       *       *       *       *       *

â€œWe are only just beginning to conjecture,â€ she said, â€œhow inextricable
is the interweaving between mind, soul, life, call it what you
will--and the purely material part of the created world. That such
interweaving existed has, of course, been known for centuries; doctors,
for instance, knew that a cheerful optimistic spirit on the part of
their patients conduced towards recovery; that fear, the mere emotion,
had a definite effect on the beat of the heart, that anger produced
chemical changes in the blood, that anxiety led to indigestion, that
under the influence of strong passion a man can do things which in his
normal state he is physically incapable of performing. Here we have
mind, in a simple and familiar manner, producing changes and effects in
tissue, in that which is purely material. By an extension of
this--though, indeed, it is scarcely an extension--we may expect to find
that mind can have an effect, not only on what we call living tissue,
but on dead things, on pieces of wood or stone. At least it is hard to
see why that should not be so.â€

â€œTable-turning, for instance?â€ I asked.

â€œThat is one instance of how some force, out of that innumerable cohort
of obscure mysterious forces with which we human beings are garrisoned,
can pass, as it is constantly doing, into material things. The laws of
its passing we do not know; sometimes we wish it to pass and it does
not. Just now, for instance, when you and I tried to turn the table,
there was some impediment in the path, though I put down that rap which
followed as an effect of our efforts. But nothing seems more natural to
my mind than that these forces should be transmissible to inanimate
things. Of the manner of its passing we know next to nothing, any more
than we know the manner of the actual process by which fear accelerates
the beating of the heart, but as surely as a Marconi message leaps along
the air by no visible or tangible bridge, so through some subtle gateway
of the body these forces can march from the citadel of the spirit into
material forms, whether that material is a living part of ourselves or
that which we choose to call inanimate nature.â€

She paused a moment.

â€œUnder certain circumstances,â€ she went on, â€œit seems that the force
which has passed from us into inanimate things can manifest its presence
there. The force that passes into a table can show itself in movements
or in noises coming from the table. The table has been charged with
physical energy. Often and often I have seen a table or a chair move
apparently of its own accord, but only when some outpouring of force,
animal magnetism--call it what you will--has been received by it. A
parallel phenomenon to my mind is exhibited in what we know as haunted
houses, houses in which, as a rule, some crime or act of extreme emotion
or passion has been committed, and in which some echo or re-enactment of
the deed is periodically made visible or audible. A murder has been
committed, let us say, and the room where it took place is haunted. The
figure of the murdered, or less commonly of the murderer, is seen there
by sensitives, and cries are heard, or steps run to and fro. The
atmosphere has somehow been charged with the scene, and the scene in
whole or part repeats itself, though under what laws we do not know,
just as a phonograph will repeat, when properly handled, what has been
said into it.â€

â€œThis is all theory,â€ I remarked.

â€œBut it appears to me to cover a curious set of facts, which is all we
ask of a theory. Otherwise, we must frankly state our disbelief in
haunted houses altogether, or suppose that the spirit of the murdered,
poor wretch, is bound under certain circumstances to re-enact the horror
of its bodyâ€™s tragedy. It was not enough that its body was killed there,
its soul has to be dragged back and live through it all again with such
vividness that its anguish becomes visible or audible to the eyes or
ears of the sensitive. That to me is unthinkable, whereas my theory is
not. Do I make it at all clear?â€

â€œIt is clear enough,â€ said I, â€œbut I want support for it, the full-sized
illustration.â€

â€œI promised you that, a ghost-story of my own experience.â€

Mrs Aldwych paused again, and then began the story which was to
illustrate her theory.

â€œIt is just a year,â€ she said, â€œsince Jack bought this house from old
Mrs Denison. We had both heard, both he and I, that it was supposed to
be haunted, but neither of us knew any particulars of the haunt
whatever. A month ago I heard what I believe to have been the ghost,
and, when Mrs Denison was staying with us last week, I asked her exactly
what it was, and found it tallied completely with my experience. I will
tell you my experience first, and give her account of the haunt
afterwards.

â€œA month ago Jack was away for a few days and I remained here alone. One
Sunday evening, I, in my usual health and spirits, as far as I am aware,
both of which are serenely excellent, went up to bed about eleven. My
room is on the first floor, just at the foot of the staircase that leads
to the floor above. There are four more rooms on my passage, all of
which that night were empty, and at the far end of it a door leads into
the landing at the top of the front staircase. On the other side of
that, as you know, are more bedrooms, all of which that night were also
unoccupied; I, in fact, was the only sleeper on the first floor.

â€œThe head of my bed is close behind my door, and there is an electric
light over it. This is controlled by a switch at the bed-head, and
another switch there turns on a light in the passage just outside my
room. That was Jackâ€™s plan: if by chance you want to leave your room
when the house is dark, you can light up the passage before you go out,
and not grope blindly for a switch outside.

â€œUsually I sleep solidly: it is very rarely indeed that I wake, when
once I have gone to sleep, before I am called. But that night I woke,
which was rare; what was rarer was that I woke in a state of shuddering
and unaccountable terror; I tried to localise my panic, to run it to
earth and reason it away, but without any success. Terror of something I
could not guess at stared me in the face, white, shaking terror. So, as
there was no use in lying quaking in the dark, I lit my lamp, and, with
the view of composing this strange disorder of my fear, began to read
again in the book I had brought up with me. The volume happened to be
â€˜The Green Carnation,â€™ a work one would have thought to be full of tonic
to twittering nerves. But it failed of success, even as my reasoning had
done, and after reading a few pages, and finding that the heart-hammer
in my throat grew no quieter, and that the grip of terror was in no way
relaxed, I put out my light and lay down again. I looked at my watch,
however, before doing this, and remember that the time was ten minutes
to two.

â€œStill matters did not mend: terror, that was slowly becoming a little
more definite, terror of some dark and violent deed that was momently
drawing nearer to me held me in its vice. Something was coming, the
advent of which was perceived by the sub-conscious sense, and was
already conveyed to my conscious mind. And then the clock struck two
jingling chimes, and the stable-clock outside clanged the hour more
sonorously.

â€œI still lay there, abject and palpitating. Then I heard a sound just
outside my room on the stairs that lead, as I have said, to the second
story, a sound which was perfectly commonplace and unmistakable. Feet
feeling their way in the dark were coming downstairs to my passage: I
could hear also the groping hand slip and slide along the bannisters.
The footfalls came along the few yards of passage between the bottom of
the stairs and my door, and then against my door itself came the brush
of drapery, and on the panels the blind groping of fingers. The handle
rattled as they passed over it, and my terror nearly rose to screaming
point.

â€œThen a sensible hope struck me. The midnight wanderer might be one of
the servants, ill or in want of something, and yet--why the shuffling
feet and the groping hand? But on the instant of the dawning of that
hope (for I knew that it was of the step and that which was moving in
the dark passage of which I was afraid) I turned on both the light at my
bed-head, and the light of the passage outside, and, opening the door,
looked out. The passage was quite bright from end to end, but it was
perfectly empty. Yet as I looked, seeing nothing of the walker, I still
heard. Down the bright boards I heard the shuffle growing fainter as it
receded, until, judging by the ear, it turned into the gallery at the
end and died away. And with it there died also all my sense of terror.
It was It of which I had been afraid: now It and my terror had passed.
And I went back to bed and slept till morning.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

Again Mrs Aldwych paused, and I was silent. Somehow it was in the
extreme simplicity of her experience that the horror lay. She went on
almost immediately.

â€œNow for the sequel,â€ she said, â€œor what I choose to call the
explanation. Mrs Denison, as I told you, came down to stay with us not
long ago, and I mentioned that we had heard, though only vaguely, that
the house was supposed to be haunted, and asked for an account of it.
This is what she told me:

â€œâ€˜In the year 1610 the heiress to the property was a girl Helen Denison,
who was engaged to be married to young Lord Southern. In case therefore
of her having children, the property would pass away from Denisons. In
case of her death, childless, it would pass to her first cousin. A week
before the marriage took place, he and a brother of his entered the
house, riding here from thirty miles away, after dark, and made their
way to her room on the second storey. There they gagged her and
attempted to kill her, but she escaped from them, groped her way along
this passage, and into the room at the end of the gallery. They followed
her there, and killed her. The facts were known by the younger brother
turning kingâ€™s evidence.â€™

â€œNow Mrs Denison told me that the ghost had never been seen, but that it
was occasionally heard coming downstairs or going along the passage. She
told me that it was never heard except between the hours of two and
three in the morning, the hour during which the murder took place.â€

â€œAnd since then have you heard it again?â€ I asked.

â€œYes, more than once. But it has never frightened me again. I feared, as
we all do, what was unknown.â€

â€œI feel that I should fear the known, if I knew it was that,â€ said I.

â€œI donâ€™t think you would for long. Whatever theory you adopt about it,
the sounds of the steps and the groping hand, I cannot see that there is
anything to shock or frighten one. My own theory you know----â€

â€œPlease apply it to what you heard,â€ I asked.

â€œSimply enough. The poor girl felt her way along this passage in the
despair of her agonised terror, hearing no doubt the soft footsteps of
her murderers gaining on her, as she groped along her lost way. The
waves of that terrible brain-storm raging within her, impressed
themselves in some subtle yet physical manner on the place. It would
only be by those people whom we call sensitives that the wrinkles, so
to speak, made by those breaking waves on the sands would be perceived,
and by them not always. But they are there, even as when a Marconi
apparatus is working the waves are there, though they can only be
perceived by a receiver that is in tune. If you believe in brain-waves
at all, the explanation is not so difficult.â€

â€œThen the brain-wave is permanent?â€

â€œEvery wave of whatever kind leaves its mark, does it not? If you
disbelieve the whole thing, shall I give you a room on the route of that
poor murdered harmless walker?â€

I got up.

â€œI am very comfortable, thanks, where I am,â€ I said.




THE TERROR BY NIGHT


The transference of emotion is a phenomenon so common, so constantly
witnessed, that mankind in general have long ceased to be conscious of
its existence, as a thing worth our wonder or consideration, regarding
it as being as natural and commonplace as the transference of things
that act by the ascertained laws of matter. Nobody, for instance, is
surprised, if, when the room is too hot, the opening of a window causes
the cold fresh air of outside to be transferred into the room, and in
the same way no one is surprised when into the same room, perhaps, which
we will imagine as being peopled with dull and gloomy persons, there
enters some one of fresh and sunny mind, who instantly brings into the
stuffy mental atmosphere a change analogous to that of the opened
windows. Exactly how this infection is conveyed we do not know;
considering the wireless wonders (that act by material laws) which are
already beginning to lose their wonder now that we have our newspaper
brought as a matter of course every morning in mid-Atlantic, it would
not perhaps be rash to conjecture that in some subtle and occult way the
transference of emotion is in reality material too. Certainly (to take
another instance) the sight of definitely material things, like writing
on a page, conveys emotion apparently direct to our minds, as when our
pleasure or pity is stirred by a book, and it is therefore possible that
mind may act on mind by means as material as that.

Occasionally, however, we come across phenomena, which, though they may
easily be as material as any of these things, are rarer, and therefore
more astounding. Some people call them ghosts, some conjuring tricks,
and some nonsense. It seems simpler to group them under the head of
transferred emotions, and they may appeal to any of the senses. Some
ghosts are seen, some heard, some felt, and though I know of no instance
of a ghost being tasted, yet it will seem in the following pages that
these occult phenomenon may appeal at any rate to the senses that
perceive heat, cold, or smell. For, to take the analogy of wireless
telegraphy, we are all of us probably â€˜receiversâ€™ to some extent, and
catch now and then a message or part of a message that the eternal waves
of emotion are ceaselessly shouting aloud to those who have ears to
hear, and materializing themselves for those who have eyes to see. Not
being, as a rule, perfectly tuned, we grasp but pieces and fragments of
such messages, a few coherent words it may be, or a few words which seem
to have no sense. The following story, however, to my mind, is
interesting, because it shows how different pieces of what no doubt was
one message were received and recorded by several different people
simultaneously. Ten years have elapsed since the events recorded took
place, but they were written down at the time.

       *       *       *       *       *

Jack Lorimer and I were very old friends before he married, and his
marriage to a first cousin of mine did not make, as so often happens, a
slackening in our intimacy. Within a few months after, it was found out
that his wife had consumption, and, without any loss of time, she was
sent off to Davos, with her sister to look after her. The disease had
evidently been detected at a very early stage, and there was excellent
ground for hoping that with proper care and strict regime she would be
cured by the life-giving frosts of that wonderful valley.

The two had gone out in the November of which I am speaking, and Jack
and I joined them for a month at Christmas, and found that week after
week she was steadily and quickly gaining ground. We had to be back in
town by the end of January, but it was settled that Ida should remain
out with her sister for a week or two more. They both, I remember, came
down to the station to see us off, and I am not likely to forget the
last words that passed:

â€œOh, donâ€™t look so woebegone Jack,â€ his wife had said; â€œyouâ€™ll see me
again before long.â€

Then the fussy little mountain engine squeaked, as a puppy squeaks when
its toe is trodden on, and we puffed our way up the pass.

London was in its usual desperate February plight, when we got back,
full of fogs and still-born frosts that seemed to produce a cold far
more bitter than the piercing temperature of those sunny altitudes from
which we had come. We both, I think, felt rather lonely, and even before
we had got to our journeyâ€™s end we had settled that for the present it
was ridiculous that we should keep open two houses when one would
suffice, and would also be far more cheerful for us both. So, as we both
lived in almost identical houses in the same street in Chelsea, we
decided to â€œtoss,â€ live in the house which the coin indicated (heads
mine, tails his) share expenses, attempt to let the other house, and, if
successful, share the proceeds. A French five-franc piece of the second
empire told us it was â€œheads.â€

We had been back some ten days, receiving every day the most excellent
accounts from Davos, when, first on him, then on me, there descended
like some tropical storm, a feeling of indefinable fear. Very possibly
this sense of apprehension (for there is nothing in the world so
virulently infectious) reached me through him: on the other hand both
these attacks of vague foreboding may have come from the same source.
But it is true that it did not attack me till he spoke of it, so the
possibility perhaps inclines to my having caught it from him. He spoke
of it first, I remember, one evening when we had met for a good-night
talk, after having come back from separate houses where we had dined.

â€œI have felt most awfully down all day,â€ he said; â€œand just after
receiving this splendid account from Daisy, I canâ€™t think what is the
matter.â€

He poured himself out some whisky and soda as he spoke.

â€œOh, touch of liver,â€ I said. â€œI shouldnâ€™t drink that if I were you.
Give it me instead.â€

â€œI was never better in my life,â€ he said.

I was opening letters, as we talked, and came across one from the house
agent, which, with trembling eagerness I read.

â€œHurrah,â€ I cried, â€œoffer of five guáµƒË¢--why canâ€™t he write it in proper
English--five guineas a week till Easter for number 31. We shall roll in
guineas!â€

â€œOh, but I canâ€™t stop here till Easter,â€ he said.

â€œI donâ€™t see why not. Nor by the way does Daisy. I heard from her this
morning, and she told me to persuade you to stop. Thatâ€™s to say, if you
like. It really is more cheerful for you here. I forgot, you were
telling me something.â€

The glorious news about the weekly guineas did not cheer him up in the
least.

â€œThanks awfully. Of course Iâ€™ll stop.â€

He moved up and down the room once or twice.

â€œNo, itâ€™s not me that is wrong,â€ he said, â€œitâ€™s It, whatever It is. The
terror by night.â€

â€œWhich you are commanded not to be afraid of,â€ I remarked.

â€œI know: itâ€™s easy commanding. Iâ€™m frightened: somethingâ€™s coming.â€

â€œFive guineas a week are coming,â€ I said. â€œI shanâ€™t sit up and be
infected by your fears. All that matters, Davos, is going as well as it
can. What was the last report? Incredibly better. Take that to bed with
you.â€

The infection--if infection it was--did not take hold of me then, for I
remember going to sleep feeling quite cheerful, but I awoke in some dark
still hour and It, the terror by night, had come while I slept. Fear and
misgiving, blind, unreasonable, and paralysing, had taken and gripped
me. What was it? Just as by an aneroid we can foretell the approach of
storm, so by this sinking of the spirit, unlike anything I had ever felt
before, I felt sure that disaster of some sort was presaged.

Jack saw it at once when we met at breakfast next morning, in the brown
haggard light of a foggy day, not dark enough for candles, but dismal
beyond all telling.

â€œSo it has come to you too,â€ he said.

And I had not even the fighting-power left to tell him that I was merely
slightly unwell. Besides, never in my life had I felt better.

All next day, all the day after that fear lay like a black cloak over my
mind; I did not know what I dreaded, but it was something very acute,
something that was very near. It was coming nearer every moment,
spreading like a pall of clouds over the sky; but on the third day,
after miserably cowering under it, I suppose some sort of courage came
back to me: either this was pure imagination, some trick of disordered
nerves or what not, in which case we were both â€œdisquieting ourselves in
vain,â€ or from the immeasurable waves of emotion that beat upon the
minds of men, something within both of us had caught a current, a
pressure. In either case it was infinitely better to try, however
ineffectively, to stand up against it. For these two days I had neither
worked nor played; I had only shrunk and shuddered; I planned for myself
a busy day, with diversion for us both in the evening.

â€œWe will dine early,â€ I said, â€œand go to the â€˜Man from Blankleyâ€™s.â€™ I
have already asked Philip to come, and he is coming, and I have
telephoned for tickets. Dinner at seven.â€

Philip, I may remark, is an old friend of ours, neighbour in this
street, and by profession a much-respected doctor.

Jack laid down his paper.

â€œYes, I expect youâ€™re right,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s no use doing nothing, it
doesnâ€™t help things. Did you sleep well?â€

â€œYes, beautifully,â€ I said rather snappishly, for I was all on edge
with the added burden of an almost sleepless night.

â€œI wish I had,â€ said he.

This would not do at all.

â€œWe have got to play up!â€ I said. â€œHere are we two strong and stalwart
persons, with as much cause for satisfaction with life as any you can
mention, letting ourselves behave like worms. Our fear may be over
things imaginary or over things that are real, but it is the fact of
being afraid that is so despicable. There is nothing in the world to
fear except fear. You know that as well as I do. Now letâ€™s read our
papers with interest. Which do you back, Mr Druce, or the Duke of
Portland, or the Times Book Club?â€

That day, therefore, passed very busily for me; and there were enough
events moving in front of that black background, which I was conscious
was there all the time, to enable me to keep my eyes away from it, and I
was detained rather late at the office, and had to drive back to
Chelsea, in order to be in time to dress for dinner, instead of walking
back as I had intended.

Then the message, which for these three days, had been twittering in our
minds, the receivers, just making them quiver and rattle came through.

       *       *       *       *       *

I found Jack already dressed, since it was within a minute or two of
seven when I got in, and sitting in the drawing-room. The day had been
warm and muggy, but when I looked in on the way up to my room, it
seemed to me to have grown suddenly and bitterly cold, not with the
dampness of English frost, but with the clear and stinging exhilaration
of such days as we had recently spent in Switzerland. Fire was laid in
the grate but not lit, and I went down on my knees on the hearth-rug to
light it.

â€œWhy, itâ€™s freezing in here,â€ I said. â€œWhat donkeys servants are! It
never occurs to them that you want fires in cold weather, and no fires
in hot weather.â€

â€œOh, for heavenâ€™s sake donâ€™t light the fire,â€ said he, â€œitâ€™s the warmest
muggiest evening I ever remember.â€

I stared at him in astonishment. My hands were shaking with the cold. He
saw this.

â€œWhy, you are shivering!â€ he said. â€œHave you caught a chill? But as to
the room being cold let us look at the thermometer.â€

There was one on the writing-table.

â€œSixty-five,â€ he said.

There was no disputing that, nor did I want to, for at that moment, it
suddenly struck us, dimly and distantly that It was â€œcoming through.â€ I
felt it like some curious internal vibration.

â€œHot or cold, I must go and dress,â€ I said.

Still shivering, but feeling as if I was breathing some rarefied
exhilarating air, I went up to my room. My clothes were already laid
out, but, by an oversight, no hot water had been brought up, and I rang
for my man. He came up almost at once, but he looked scared, or, to my
already-startled senses, he appeared so.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ I asked.

â€œNothing, sir,â€ he said, and he could hardly articulate the words. â€œI
thought you rang.â€

â€œYes. Hot water. But whatâ€™s the matter?â€

He shifted from one foot to the other.

â€œI thought I saw a lady on the stairs,â€ he said, â€œcoming up close behind
me. And the front door bell hadnâ€™t rung that I heard.â€

â€œWhere did you think you saw her?â€ I asked.

â€œOn the stairs. Then on the landing outside the drawing-room door, sir,â€
he said. â€œShe stood there as if she didnâ€™t know whether to go in or
not.â€

â€œOne--one of the servants,â€ I said. But again I felt that It was coming
through.

â€œNo, sir. It was none of the servants,â€ he said.

â€œWho was it then?â€

â€œCouldnâ€™t see distinctly sir, it was dim-like. But I thought it was Mrs
Lorimer.â€

â€œOh, go and get me some hot water,â€ I said.

But he lingered; he was quite clearly frightened.

       *       *       *       *       *

At this moment the front-door bell rang. It was just seven, and already
Philip had come with brutal punctuality while I was not yet
half-dressed.

â€œThatâ€™s Dr Enderly,â€ I said. â€œPerhaps if he is on the stairs you may be
able to pass the place where you saw the lady.â€

Then quite suddenly there rang through the house a scream, so terrible,
so appalling in its agony and supreme terror, that I simply stood still
and shuddered, unable to move. Then by an effort so violent that I felt
as if something must break, I recalled the power of motion, and ran
downstairs, my man at my heels, to meet Philip who was running up from
the ground floor. He had heard it too.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ he said. â€œWhat was that?â€

       *       *       *       *       *

Together we went into the drawing-room, Jack was lying in front of the
fireplace, with the chair in which he had been sitting a few minutes
before overturned. Philip went straight to him and bent over him,
tearing open his white shirt.

â€œOpen all the windows,â€ he said, â€œthe place reeks.â€

We flung open the windows, and there poured in, so it seemed to me, a
stream of hot air into the bitter cold. Eventually Philip got up.

â€œHe is dead,â€ he said. â€œKeep the windows open. The place is still thick
with chloroform.â€

Gradually to my sense the room got warmer, to Philipâ€™s the drug-laden
atmosphere dispersed. But neither my servant nor I had smelt anything at
all.

A couple of hours later there came a telegram from Davos for me. It was
to tell me to break the news of Daisyâ€™s death to Jack, and was sent by
her sister. She supposed he would come out immediately. But he had been
gone two hours now.

I left for Davos next day, and learned what had happened. Daisy had been
suffering for three days from a little abscess which had to be opened,
and, though the operation was of the slightest, she had been so nervous
about it that the doctor gave her chloroform. She made a good recovery
from the anÃ¦sthetic, but an hour later had a sudden attack of syncope,
and had died that night at a few minutes before eight, by central
European time, corresponding to seven in English time. She had insisted
that Jack should be told nothing about this little operation till it was
over, since the matter was quite unconnected with her general health,
and she did not wish to cause him needless anxiety.

And there the story ends. To my servant there came the sight of a woman
outside the drawing-room door, where Jack was, hesitating about her
entrance, at the moment when Daisyâ€™s soul hovered between the two
worlds; to me there came--I do not think it is fanciful to suppose
this--the keen exhilarating cold of Davos; to Philip there came the
fumes of chloroform. And to Jack, I must suppose, came his wife. So he
joined her.




THE OTHER BED


I had gone out to Switzerland just before Christmas, expecting, from
experience, a month of divinely renovating weather, of skating all day
in brilliant sun, and basking in the hot frost of that windless
atmosphere. Occasionally, as I knew, there might be a snowfall, which
would last perhaps for forty-eight hours at the outside, and would be
succeeded by another ten days of cloudless perfection, cold even to zero
at night, but irradiated all day long by the unflecked splendour of the
sun.

Instead the climatic conditions were horrible. Day after day a gale
screamed through this upland valley that should have been so windless
and serene, bringing with it a tornado of sleet that changed to snow by
night. For ten days there was no abatement of it, and evening after
evening, as I consulted my barometer, feeling sure that the black finger
would show that we were coming to the end of these abominations, I found
that it had sunk a little lower yet, till it stayed, like a homing
pigeon, on the S of storm. I mention these things in depreciation of the
story that follows, in order that the intelligent reader may say at
once, if he wishes, that all that occurred was merely a result of the
malaise of nerves and digestion that perhaps arose from those
storm-bound and disturbing conditions. And now to go back to the
beginning again.

I had written to engage a room at the HÃ´tel Beau Site, and had been
agreeably surprised on arrival to find that for the modest sum of twelve
francs a day I was allotted a room on the first floor with two beds in
it. Otherwise the hotel was quite full. Fearing to be billeted in a
twenty-two-franc room, by mistake, I instantly confirmed my arrangements
at the bureau. There was no mistake: I had ordered a twelve-franc room
and had been given one. The very civil clerk hoped that I was satisfied
with it, for otherwise there was nothing vacant. I hastened to say that
I was more than satisfied, fearing the fate of Esau.

I arrived about three in the afternoon of a cloudless and glorious day,
the last of the series. I hurried down to the rink, having had the
prudence to put skates in the forefront of my luggage, and spent a
divine but struggling hour or two, coming up to the hotel about sunset.
I had letters to write, and after ordering tea to be sent up to my
gorgeous apartment, No. 23, on the first floor, I went straight up
there.

The door was ajar and--I feel certain I should not even remember this
now except in the light of what followed--just as I got close to it, I
heard some faint movement inside the room and instinctively knew that
my servant was there unpacking. Next moment I was in the room myself,
and it was empty. The unpacking had been finished, and everything was
neat, orderly, and comfortable. My barometer was on the table, and I
observed with dismay that it had gone down nearly half an inch. I did
not give another thought to the movement I thought I had heard from
outside.

Certainly I had a delightful room for my twelve francs a day. There
were, as I have said, two beds in it, on one of which were already laid
out my dress-clothes, while night-things were disposed on the other.
There were two windows, between which stood a large washing-stand, with
plenty of room on it; a sofa with its back to the light stood
conveniently near the pipes of central heating, there were a couple of
good arm-chairs, a writing table, and, rarest of luxuries, another
table, so that every time one had breakfast it was not necessary to pile
up a drift of books and papers to make room for the tray. My window
looked east, and sunset still flamed on the western faces of the virgin
snows, while above, in spite of the dejected barometer, the sky was bare
of clouds, and a thin slip of pale crescent moon was swung high among
the stars that still burned dimly in these first moments of their
kindling. Tea came up for me without delay, and, as I ate, I regarded my
surroundings with extreme complacency.

Then, quite suddenly and without cause, I saw that the disposition of
the beds would never do; I could not possibly sleep in the bed that my
servant had chosen for me, and without pause I jumped up, transferred my
dress clothes to the other bed, and put my night things where they had
been. It was done breathlessly almost, and not till then did I ask
myself why I had done it. I found I had not the slightest idea. I had
merely felt that I could not sleep in the other bed. But having made the
change I felt perfectly content.

My letters took me an hour or so to finish, and I had yawned and blinked
considerably over the last one or two, in part from their inherent
dullness, in part from quite natural sleepiness. For I had been in the
train for twenty-four hours, and was fresh to these bracing airs which
so conduce to appetite, activity, and sleep, and as there was still an
hour before I need dress, I lay down on my sofa with a book for excuse,
but the intention to slumber as reason. And consciousness ceased as if a
tap had been turned off.

Then--I dreamed. I dreamed that my servant came very quietly into the
room, to tell me no doubt that it was time to dress. I supposed there
were a few minutes to spare yet, and that he saw I was dozing, for,
instead of rousing me, he moved quietly about the room, setting things
in order. The light appeared to me to be very dim, for I could not see
him with any distinctness, indeed, I only knew it was he because it
could not be anybody else. Then he paused by my washing-stand, which had
a shelf for brushes and razors above it, and I saw him take a razor from
its case and begin stropping it; the light was strongly reflected on the
blade of the razor. He tried the edge once or twice on his thumbnail,
and then to my horror I saw him trying it on his throat. Instantaneously
one of those deafening dream-crashes awoke me, and I saw the door half
open, and my servant in the very act of coming in. No doubt the opening
of the door had constituted the crash.

I had joined a previously-arrived party of five, all of us old friends,
and accustomed to see each other often, and at dinner, and afterwards in
intervals of bridge, the conversation roamed agreeably over a variety of
topics, rocking-turns and the prospects of weather (a thing of vast
importance in Switzerland, and not a commonplace subject) and the
performances at the opera, and under what circumstances as revealed in
dummyâ€™s hand, is it justifiable for a player to refuse to return his
partnerâ€™s original lead in no trumps. Then over whisky and soda and the
repeated â€œlast cigarette,â€ it veered back via the Zantzigs to thought
transference and the transference of emotion. Here one of the party,
Harry Lambert, put forward the much discussed explanation of haunted
houses based on this principle. He put it very concisely.

â€œEverything that happens,â€ he said, â€œwhether it is a step we take, or a
thought that crosses our mind, makes some change in its immediate
material world. Now the most violent and concentrated emotion we can
imagine is the emotion that leads a man to take so extreme a step as
killing himself or somebody else. I can easily imagine such a deed so
eating into the material scene, the room or the haunted heath, where it
happens, that its mark lasts an enormous time. The air rings with the
cry of the slain and still drips with his blood. It is not everybody who
will perceive it, but sensitives will. By the way, I am sure that man
who waits on us at dinner is a sensitive.â€

It was already late, and I rose.

â€œLet us hurry him to the scene of a crime,â€ I said. â€œFor myself I shall
hurry to the scene of sleep.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

Outside the threatening promise of the barometer was already finding
fulfilment, and a cold ugly wind was complaining among the pines, and
hooting round the peaks, and snow had begun to fall. The night was
thickly overcast, and it seemed as if uneasy presences were going to and
fro in the darkness. But there was no use in ill augury, and certainly
if we were to be house-bound for a few days I was lucky in having so
commodious a lodging. I had plenty to occupy myself with indoors, though
I should vastly have preferred to be engaged outside, and in the
immediate present how good it was to lie free in a proper bed after a
cramped night in the train.

       *       *       *       *       *

I was half-undressed when there came a tap at my door, and the waiter
who had served us at dinner came in carrying a bottle of whisky. He was
a tall young fellow, and though I had not noticed him at dinner, I saw
at once now, as he stood in the glare of the electric light, what Harry
had meant when he said he was sure he was a sensitive. There is no
mistaking that look: it is exhibited in a peculiar â€œinlookingâ€ of the
eye. Those eyes, one knows, see further than the surface....

â€œThe bottle of whisky for monsieur,â€ he said, putting it down on the
table.

â€œBut I ordered no whisky,â€ said I.

He looked puzzled.

â€œNumber twenty-three?â€ he said.

Then he glanced at the other bed.

â€œAh, for the other gentleman, without doubt,â€ he said.

â€œBut there is no other gentleman,â€ said I. â€œI am alone here.â€

He took up the bottle again.

â€œPardon, monsieur,â€ he said. â€œThere must be a mistake. I am new here; I
only came to-day. But I thought----â€

â€œYes?â€ said I.

â€œI thought that number twenty-three had ordered a bottle of whisky,â€ he
repeated. â€œGood-night, monsieur, and pardon.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

I got into bed, extinguished the light, and feeling very sleepy and
heavy with the oppression, no doubt, of the snow that was coming,
expected to fall asleep at once. Instead my mind would not quite go to
roost, but kept sleepily stumbling about among the little events of the
day, as some tired pedestrian in the dark stumbles over stones instead
of lifting his feet. And as I got sleepier it seemed to me that my mind
kept moving in a tiny little circle. At one moment it drowsily
recollected how I had thought I had heard movement inside my room, at
the next it remembered my dream of some figure going stealthily about
and stropping a razor, at a third it wondered why this Swiss waiter with
the eyes of a â€œsensitiveâ€ thought that number twenty-three had ordered a
bottle of whisky. But at the time I made no guess as to any coherence
between these little isolated facts; I only dwelt on them with drowsy
persistence. Then a fourth fact came to join the sleepy circle, and I
wondered why I had felt a repugnance against using the other bed. But
there was no explanation of this forthcoming, either, and the outlines
of thought grew more blurred and hazy, until I lost consciousness
altogether.

       *       *       *       *       *

Next morning began the series of awful days, sleet and snow falling
relentlessly with gusts of chilly wind, making any out-of-door
amusement next to impossible. The snow was too soft for toboganning, it
balled on the skies, and as for the rink it was but a series of pools of
slushy snow. This in itself, of course, was quite enough to account for
any ordinary depression and heaviness of spirit, but all the time I felt
there was something more than that to which I owed the utter blackness
that hung over those days. I was beset too by fear that at first was
only vague, but which gradually became more definite, until it resolved
itself into a fear of number twenty-three and in particular a terror of
the other bed. I had no notion why or how I was afraid of it, the thing
was perfectly causeless, but the shape and the outline of it grew slowly
clearer, as detail after detail of ordinary life, each minute and
trivial in itself, carved and moulded this fear, till it became
definite. Yet the whole thing was so causeless and childish that I could
speak to no one of it; I could but assure myself that it was all a
figment of nerves disordered by this unseemly weather.

However, as to the details, there were plenty of them. Once I woke up
from strangling nightmare, unable at first to move, but in a panic of
terror, believing that I was sleeping in the other bed. More than once,
too, awaking before I was called, and getting out of bed to look at the
aspect of the morning, I saw with a sense of dreadful misgiving that the
bed-clothes on the other bed were strangely disarranged, as if some one
had slept there, and smoothed them down afterwards, but not so well as
not to give notice of the occupation. So one night I laid a trap, so to
speak, for the intruder, of which the real object was to calm my own
nervousness (for I still told myself that I was frightened of nothing),
and tucked in the sheet very carefully, laying the pillow on the top of
it. But in the morning it seemed as if my interference had not been to
the taste of the occupant, for there was more impatient disorder than
usual in the bed-clothes, and on the pillow was an indentation, round
and rather deep, such as we may see any morning in our own beds. Yet by
day these things did not frighten me, but it was when I went to bed at
night that I quaked at the thought of further developments.

It happened also from time to time that I wanted something brought me,
or wanted my servant. On three or four of these occasions my bell was
answered by the â€œSensitive,â€ as we called him, but the Sensitive, I
noticed, never came into the room. He would open the door a chink to
receive my order, and on returning would again open it a chink to say
that my boots, or whatever it was, were at the door. Once I made him
come in, but I saw him cross himself as, with a face of icy terror, he
stepped into the room, and the sight somehow did not reassure me. Twice
also he came up in the evening, when I had not rung at all, even as he
came up the first night, and opened the door a chink to say that my
bottle of whisky was outside. But the poor fellow was in a state of such
bewilderment when I went out and told him that I had not ordered whisky,
that I did not press for an explanation. He begged my pardon profusely;
he thought a bottle of whisky had been ordered for number twenty-three.
It was his mistake, entirely--I should not be charged for it; it must
have been the other gentleman. Pardon again; he remembered there was no
other gentleman, the other bed was unoccupied.

It was on the night when this happened for the second time that I
definitely began to wish that I too was quite certain that the other bed
was unoccupied. The ten days of snow and sleet were at an end, and
to-night the moon once more, grown from a mere slip to a shining shield,
swung serenely among the stars. But though at dinner everyone exhibited
an extraordinary change of spirit, with the rising of the barometer and
the discharge of this huge snow-fall, the intolerable gloom which had
been mine so long but deepened and blackened. The fear was to me now
like some statue, nearly finished, modelled by the carving hands of
these details, and though it still stood below its moistened sheet, any
moment, I felt, the sheet might be twitched away, and I be confronted
with it. Twice that evening I had started to go to the bureau, to ask to
have a bed made up for me, anywhere, in the billiard-room or the
smoking-room, since the hotel was full, but the intolerable childishness
of the proceeding revolted me. What was I afraid of? A dream of my own,
a mere nightmare? Some fortuitous disarrangement of bed-linen? The fact
that a Swiss waiter made mistakes about bottles of whisky? It was an
impossible cowardice.

But equally impossible that night were billiards or bridge, or any form
of diversion. My only salvation seemed to lie in downright hard work,
and soon after dinner I went to my room (in order to make my first real
counter-move against fear) and sat down solidly to several hours of
proof-correcting, a menial and monotonous employment, but one which is
necessary, and engages the entire attention. But first I looked
thoroughly round the room, to reassure myself, and found all modern and
solid; a bright paper of daisies on the wall, a floor parquetted, the
hot-water pipes chuckling to themselves in the corner, my bed-clothes
turned down for the night, the other bed----

The electric light was burning brightly, and there seemed to me to be a
curious stain, as of a shadow, on the lower part of the pillow and the
top of the sheet, definite and suggestive, and for a moment I stood
there again throttled by a nameless terror. Then taking my courage in my
hands I went closer and looked at it. Then I touched it; the sheet,
where the stain or shadow was, seemed damp to the hand, so also was the
pillow. And then I remembered; I had thrown some wet clothes on the bed
before dinner. No doubt that was the reason. And fortified by this
extremely simple dissipation of my fear, I sat down and began on my
proofs. But my fear had been this, that the stain had not in that first
moment looked like the mere greyness of water-moistened linen.

From below, at first, came the sound of music, for they were dancing
to-night, but I grew absorbed in my work, and only recorded the fact
that after a time there was no more music. Steps went along the
passages, and I heard the buzz of conversation on landings, and the
closing of doors till by degrees the silence became noticeable. The
loneliness of night had come.

It was after the silence had become lonely that I made the first pause
in my work, and by the watch on my table saw that it was already past
midnight. But I had little more to do; another half-hour would see the
end of the business, but there were certain notes I had to make for
future reference, and my stock of paper was already exhausted. However,
I had bought some in the village that afternoon, and it was in the
bureau downstairs, where I had left it, when I came in and had
subsequently forgotten to bring it upstairs. It would be the work of a
minute only to get it.

The electric light had brightened considerably during the last hour,
owing no doubt to many burners being put out in the hotel, and as I left
the room I saw again the stain on the pillow and sheet of the other bed.
I had really forgotten all about it for the last hour, and its presence
there came as an unwelcome surprise. Then I remembered the explanation
of it, which had struck me before, and for purposes of self-reassurement
I again touched it. It was still damp, but--Had I got chilly with my
work? For it was warm to the hand. Warm, and surely rather sticky. It
did not seem like the touch of the water-damp. And at the same moment I
knew I was not alone in the room. There was something there, something
silent as yet, and as yet invisible. But it was there.

Now for the consolation of persons who are inclined to be fearful, I may
say at once that I am in no way brave, but that terror which, God knows,
was real enough, was yet so interesting, that interest overruled it. I
stood for a moment by the other bed, and, half-consciously only, wiped
the hand that had felt the stain, for the touch of it, though all the
time I told myself that it was but the touch of the melted snow on the
coat I had put there, was unpleasant and unclean. More than that I did
not feel, because in the presence of the unknown and the perhaps awful,
the sense of curiosity, one of the strongest instincts we have, came to
the fore. So, rather eager to get back to my room again, I ran
downstairs to get the packet of paper. There was still a light in the
bureau, and the Sensitive, on night-duty, I suppose, was sitting there
dozing. My entrance did not disturb him, for I had on noiseless felt
slippers, and seeing at once the package I was in search of, I took it,
and left him still unawakened. That was somehow of a fortifying nature.
The Sensitive anyhow could sleep in his hard chair; the occupant of the
unoccupied bed was not calling to him to-night.

I closed my door quietly, as one does at night when the house is silent,
and sat down at once to open my packet of paper and finish my work. It
was wrapped up in an old news-sheet, and struggling with the last of the
string that bound it, certain words caught my eye. Also the date at the
top of the paper caught my eye, a date nearly a year old, or, to be
quite accurate, a date fifty-one weeks old. It was an American paper and
what it recorded was this:

â€œThe body of Mr Silas R. Hume, who committed suicide last week at the
HÃ´tel Beau Site, Moulin sur Chalons, is to be buried at his house in
Boston, Mass. The inquest held in Switzerland showed that he cut his
throat with a razor, in an attack of delirium tremens induced by drink.
In the cupboard of his room were found three dozen empty bottles of
Scotch whisky....â€

So far I had read when without warning the electric light went out, and
I was left in, what seemed for the moment, absolute darkness. And again
I knew I was not alone, and I knew now who it was who was with me in the
room.

Then the absolute paralysis of fear seized me. As if a wind had blown
over my head, I felt the hair of it stir and rise a little. My eyes
also, I suppose, became accustomed to the sudden darkness, for they
could now perceive the shape of the furniture in the room from the light
of the starlit sky outside. They saw more too than the mere furniture.
There was standing by the wash-stand between the two windows a figure,
clothed only in night-garments, and its hands moved among the objects on
the shelf above the basin. Then with two steps it made a sort of dive
for the other bed, which was in shadow. And then the sweat poured on to
my forehead.

Though the other bed stood in shadow I could still see dimly, but
sufficiently, what was there. The shape of a head lay on the pillow, the
shape of an arm lifted its hand to the electric bell that was close by
on the wall, and I fancied I could hear it distantly ringing. Then a
moment later came hurrying feet up the stairs and along the passage
outside, and a quick rapping at my door.

â€œMonsieurâ€™s whisky, monsieurâ€™s whisky,â€ said a voice just outside.
â€œPardon, monsieur, I brought it as quickly as I could.â€

The impotent paralysis of cold terror was still on me. Once I tried to
speak and failed, and still the gentle tapping went on at the door, and
the voice telling some one that his whisky was there. Then at a second
attempt, I heard a voice which was mine saying hoarsely:

â€œFor Godâ€™s sake come in; I am alone with it.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

There was the click of a turned door-handle, and as suddenly as it had
gone out a few seconds before, the electric light came back again, and
the room was in full illumination. I saw a face peer round the corner of
the door, but it was at another face I looked, the face of a man sallow
and shrunken, who lay in the other bed, staring at me with glazed eyes.
He lay high in bed, and his throat was cut from ear to ear; and the
lower part of the pillow was soaked in blood, and the sheet streamed
with it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Then suddenly that hideous vision vanished, and there was only a
sleepy-eyed waiter looking into the room. But below the sleepiness
terror was awake, and his voice shook when he spoke.

â€œMonsieur rang?â€ he asked.

No, monsieur had not rung. But monsieur made himself a couch in the
billiard-room.




THE THING IN THE HALL


The following pages are the account given me by Dr Assheton of the Thing
in the Hall. I took notes, as copious as my quickness of hand allowed
me, from his dictation, and subsequently read to him this narrative in
its transcribed and connected form. This was on the day before his
death, which indeed probably occurred within an hour after I had left
him, and, as readers of inquests and such atrocious literature may
remember, I had to give evidence before the coronerâ€™s jury. Only a week
before Dr Assheton had to give similar evidence, but as a medical
expert, with regard to the death of his friend, Louis Fielder, which
occurred in a manner identical with his own. As a specialist, he said he
believed that his friend had committed suicide while of unsound mind,
and the verdict was brought in accordingly. But in the inquest held over
Dr Asshetonâ€™s body, though the verdict eventually returned was the same,
there was more room for doubt.

For I was bound to state that only shortly before his death, I read what
follows to him; that he corrected me with extreme precision on a few
points of detail, that he seemed perfectly himself, and that at the end
he used these words:

â€œI am quite certain as a brain specialist that I am completely sane, and
that these things happened not merely in my imagination, but in the
external world. If I had to give evidence again about poor Louis, I
should be compelled to take a different line. Please put that down at
the end of your account, or at the beginning, if it arranges itself
better so.â€

There will be a few words I must add at the end of this story, and a few
words of explanation must precede it. Briefly, they are these.

Francis Assheton and Louis Fielder were up at Cambridge together, and
there formed the friendship that lasted nearly till their death. In
general attributes no two men could have been less alike, for while Dr
Assheton had become at the age of thirty-five the first and final
authority on his subject, which was the functions and diseases of the
brain, Louis Fielder at the same age was still on the threshold of
achievement. Assheton, apparently without any brilliance at all, had by
careful and incessant work arrived at the top of his profession, while
Fielder, brilliant at school, brilliant at college and brilliant ever
afterwards, had never done anything. He was too eager, so it seemed to
his friends, to set about the dreary work of patient investigation and
logical deductions; he was for ever guessing and prying, and striking
out luminous ideas, which he left burning, so to speak, to illumine the
work of others. But at bottom, the two men had this compelling interest
in common, namely, an insatiable curiosity after the unknown, perhaps
the most potent bond yet devised between the solitary units that make up
the race of man. Both--till the end--were absolutely fearless, and Dr
Assheton would sit by the bedside of the man stricken with bubonic
plague to note the gradual surge of the tide of disease to the reasoning
faculty with the same absorption as Fielder would study X-rays one week,
flying machines the next, and spiritualism the third. The rest of the
story, I think, explains itself--or does not quite do so. This, anyhow,
is what I read to Dr Assheton, being the connected narrative of what he
had himself told me. It is he, of course, who speaks.

       *       *       *       *       *

â€œAfter I returned from Paris, where I had studied under Charcot, I set
up practice at home. The general doctrine of hypnotism, suggestion, and
cure by such means had been accepted even in London by this time, and,
owing to a few papers I had written on the subject, together with my
foreign diplomas, I found that I was a busy man almost as soon as I had
arrived in town. Louis Fielder had his ideas about how I should make my
dÃ©but (for he had ideas on every subject, and all of them original), and
entreated me to come and live not in the stronghold of doctors,
â€˜Chloroform Square,â€™ as he called it, but down in Chelsea, where there
was a house vacant next his own.

â€˜Who cares where a doctor lives,â€™ he said, â€˜so long as he cures people?
Besides you donâ€™t believe in old methods; why believe in old localities?
Oh, there is an atmosphere of painless death in Chloroform Square! Come
and make people live instead! And on most evenings I shall have so much
to tell you; I canâ€™t â€œdrop inâ€ across half London.â€™

Now if you have been abroad for five years, it is a great deal to know
that you have any intimate friend at all still left in the metropolis,
and, as Louis said, to have that intimate friend next door, is an
excellent reason for going next door. Above all, I remembered from
Cambridge days, what Louisâ€™ â€˜dropping inâ€™ meant. Towards bed-time, when
work was over, there would come a rapid step on the landing, and for an
hour, or two hours, he would gush with ideas. He simply diffused life,
which is ideas, wherever he went. He fed oneâ€™s brain, which is the one
thing which matters. Most people who are ill, are ill because their
brain is starving, and the body rebels, and gets lumbago or cancer. That
is the chief doctrine of my work such as it has been. All bodily disease
springs from the brain. It is merely the brain that has to be fed and
rested and exercised properly to make the body absolutely healthy, and
immune from all disease. But when the brain is affected, it is as useful
to pour medicines down the sink, as make your patient swallow them,
unless--and this is a paramount limitation--unless he believes in them.

I said something of the kind to Louis one night, when, at the end of a
busy day, I had dined with him. We were sitting over coffee in the hall,
or so it is called, where he takes his meals. Outside, his house is just
like mine, and ten thousand other small houses in London, but on
entering, instead of finding a narrow passage with a door on one side,
leading into the dining-room, which again communicates with a small back
room called â€˜the study,â€™ he has had the sense to eliminate all
unnecessary walls, and consequently the whole ground floor of his house
is one room, with stairs leading up to the first floor. Study,
dining-room and passage have been knocked into one; you enter a big room
from the front door. The only drawback is that the postman makes loud
noises close to you, as you dine, and just as I made these commonplace
observations to him about the effect of the brain on the body and the
senses, there came a loud rap, somewhere close to me, that was
startling.

â€˜You ought to muffle your knocker,â€™ I said, â€˜anyhow during the time of
meals.â€™

Louis leaned back and laughed.

â€˜There isnâ€™t a knocker,â€™ he said. â€˜You were startled a week ago, and
said the same thing. So I took the knocker off. The letters slide in
now. But you heard a knock, did you?â€™

â€˜Didnâ€™t you?â€™ said I.

â€˜Why, certainly. But it wasnâ€™t the postman. It was the Thing. I donâ€™t
know what it is. That makes it so interesting.â€™

Now if there is one thing that the hypnotist, the believer in
unexplained influences, detests and despises, it is the whole
root-notion of spiritualism. Drugs are not more opposed to his belief
than the exploded, discredited idea of the influence of spirits on our
lives. And both are discredited for the same reason; it is easy to
understand how brain can act on brain, just as it is easy to understand
how body can act on body, so that there is no more difficulty in the
reception of the idea that the strong mind can direct the weak one, than
there is in the fact of a wrestler of greater strength overcoming one of
less. But that spirits should rap at furniture and divert the course of
events is as absurd as administering phosphorus to strengthen the brain.
That was what I thought then.

However, I felt sure it was the postman, and instantly rose and went to
the door. There were no letters in the box, and I opened the door. The
postman was just ascending the steps. He gave the letters into my hand.

Louis was sipping his coffee when I came back to the table.

â€˜Have you ever tried table-turning?â€™ he asked. â€˜Itâ€™s rather odd.â€™

â€˜No, and I have not tried violet-leaves as a cure for cancer,â€™ I said.

â€˜Oh, try everything,â€™ he said. â€˜I know that that is your plan, just as
it is mine. All these years that you have been away, you have tried all
sorts of things, first with no faith, then with just a little faith, and
finally with mountain-moving faith. Why, you didnâ€™t believe in hypnotism
at all when you went to Paris.â€™

He rang the bell as he spoke, and his servant came up and cleared the
table. While this was being done we strolled about the room, looking at
prints, with applause for a Bartolozzi that Louis had bought in the New
Cut, and dead silence over a â€˜Perditaâ€™ which he had acquired at
considerable cost. Then he sat down again at the table on which we had
dined. It was round, and mahogany-heavy, with a central foot divided
into claws.

â€˜Try its weight,â€™ he said; â€˜see if you can push it about.â€™

So I held the edge of it in my hands, and found that I could just move
it. But that was all; it required the exercise of a good deal of
strength to stir it.

â€˜Now put your hands on the top of it,â€™ he said, â€˜and see what you can
do.â€™

I could not do anything, my fingers merely slipped about on it. But I
protested at the idea of spending the evening thus.

â€˜I would much sooner play chess or noughts and crosses with you,â€™ I
said, â€˜or even talk about politics, than turn tables. You wonâ€™t mean to
push, nor shall I, but we shall push without meaning to.â€™

Louis nodded.

â€˜Just a minute,â€™ he said, â€˜let us both put our fingers only on the top
of the table and push for all we are worth, from right to left.â€™

We pushed. At least I pushed, and I observed his finger-nails. From pink
they grew to white, because of the pressure he exercised. So I must
assume that he pushed too. Once, as we tried this, the table creaked.
But it did not move.

Then there came a quick peremptory rap, not I thought on the front door,
but somewhere in the room.

â€˜Itâ€™s the Thing,â€™ said he.

To-day, as I speak to you, I suppose it was. But on that evening it
seemed only like a challenge. I wanted to demonstrate its absurdity.

â€˜For five years, on and off, Iâ€™ve been studying rank spiritualism,â€™ he
said. â€˜I havenâ€™t told you before, because I wanted to lay before you
certain phenomena, which I canâ€™t explain, but which now seem to me to be
at my command. You shall see and hear, and then decide if you will help
me.â€™

â€˜And in order to let me see better, you are proposing to put out the
lights,â€™ I said.

â€˜Yes; you will see why.â€™

â€˜I am here as a sceptic,â€™ said I.

â€˜Scep away,â€™ said he.

Next moment the room was in darkness, except for a very faint glow of
firelight. The window-curtains were thick, and no street-illumination
penetrated them, and the familiar, cheerful sounds of pedestrians and
wheeled traffic came in muffled. I was at the side of the table towards
the door; Louis was opposite me, for I could see his figure dimly
silhouetted against the glow from the smouldering fire.

â€˜Put your hands on the table,â€™ he said, â€˜quite lightly, and--how shall I
say it--expect.â€™

Still protesting in spirit, I expected. I could hear his breathing
rather quickened, and it seemed to me odd that anybody could find
excitement in standing in the dark over a large mahogany table,
expecting. Then--through my finger-tips, laid lightly on the table,
there began to come a faint vibration, like nothing so much as the
vibration through the handle of a kettle when water is beginning to boil
inside it. This got gradually more pronounced and violent till it was
like the throbbing of a motor-car. It seemed to give off a low humming
note. Then quite suddenly the table seemed to slip from under my fingers
and began very slowly to revolve.

â€˜Keep your hands on it and move with it,â€™ said Louis, and as he spoke I
saw his silhouette pass away from in front of the fire, moving as the
table moved.

For some moments there was silence, and we continued, rather absurdly,
to circle round keeping step, so to speak, with the table. Then Louis
spoke again, and his voice was trembling with excitement.

â€˜Are you there?â€™ he said.

There was no reply, of course, and he asked it again. This time there
came a rap like that which I had thought during dinner to be the
postman. But whether it was that the room was dark, or that despite
myself I felt rather excited too, it seemed to me now to be far louder
than before. Also it appeared to come neither from here nor there, but
to be diffused through the room.

Then the curious revolving of the table ceased, but the intense, violent
throbbing continued. My eyes were fixed on it, though owing to the
darkness I could see nothing, when quite suddenly a little speck of
light moved across it, so that for an instant I saw my own hands. Then
came another and another, like the spark of matches struck in the dark,
or like fire-flies crossing the dusk in southern gardens. Then came
another knock of shattering loudness, and the throbbing of the table
ceased, and the lights vanished.

       *       *       *       *       *

Such were the phenomena at the first sÃ©ance at which I was present, but
Fielder, it must be remembered, had been studying, â€˜expecting,â€™ he
called it, for some years. To adopt spiritualistic language (which at
that time I was very far from doing), he was the medium, I merely the
observer, and all the phenomena I had seen that night were habitually
produced or witnessed by him. I make this limitation since he told me
that certain of them now appeared to be outside his own control
altogether. The knockings would come when his mind, as far as he knew,
was entirely occupied in other matters, and sometimes he had even been
awakened out of sleep by them. The lights were also independent of his
volition.

Now my theory at the time was that all these things were purely
subjective in him, and that what he expressed by saying that they were
out of his control, meant that they had become fixed and rooted in the
unconscious self, of which we know so little, but which, more and more,
we see to play so enormous a part in the life of a man. In fact, it is
not too much to say that the vast majority of our deeds spring,
apparently without volition, from this unconscious self. All hearing is
the unconscious exercise of the aural nerve, all seeing of the optic,
all walking, all ordinary movement seem to be done without the exercise
of will on our part. Nay more, should we take to some new form of
progression, skating, for instance, the beginner will learn with falls
and difficulty the outside edge, but within a few hours of his having
learned his balance on it, he will give no more thought to what he
learned so short a time ago as an acrobatic feat, than he gives to the
placing of one foot before the other.

But to the brain specialist all this was intensely interesting, and to
the student of hypnotism, as I was, even more so, for (such was the
conclusion I came to after this first sÃ©ance), the fact that I saw and
heard just what Louis saw and heard was an exhibition of
thought-transference which in all my experience in the Charcot-schools I
had never seen surpassed, if indeed rivalled. I knew that I was myself
extremely sensitive to suggestion, and my part in it this evening I
believed to be purely that of the receiver of suggestions so vivid that
I visualised and heard these phenomena which existed only in the brain
of my friend.

We talked over what had occurred upstairs. His view was that the Thing
was trying to communicate with us. According to him it was the Thing
that moved the table and tapped, and made us see streaks of light.

â€˜Yes, but the Thing,â€™ I interrupted, â€˜what do you mean? Is it a
great-uncle--oh, I have seen so many relatives appear at sÃ©ances, and
heard so many of their dreadful platitudes--or what is it? A spirit?
Whose spirit?â€™

Louis was sitting opposite to me, and on the little table before us
there was an electric light. Looking at him I saw the pupil of his eye
suddenly dilate. To the medical man--provided that some violent change
in the light is not the cause of the dilation--that meant only one
thing, terror. But it quickly resumed its normal proportion again.

Then he got up, and stood in front of the fire.

â€˜No, I donâ€™t think it is great-uncle anybody,â€™ he said, â€˜I donâ€™t know,
as I told you, what the Thing is. But if you ask me what my conjecture
is, it is that the Thing is an Elemental.â€™

â€˜And pray explain further. What is an Elemental?â€™

Once again his eye dilated.

â€˜It will take two minutes,â€™ he said. â€˜But, listen. There are good things
in this world, are there not, and bad things? Cancer, I take it is bad,
and--and fresh air is good; honesty is good, lying is bad. Impulses of
some sort direct both sides, and some power suggests the impulses. Well,
I went into this spiritualistic business impartially. I learned to
â€œexpect,â€ to throw open the door into the soul, and I said, â€œAnyone may
come in.â€ And I think Something has applied for admission, the Thing
that tapped and turned the table and struck matches, as you saw, across
it. Now the control of the evil principle in the world is in the hands
of a power which entrusts its errands to the things which I call
Elementals. Oh, they have been seen; I doubt not that they will be seen
again. I did not, and do not ask good spirits to come in. I donâ€™t want
â€œThe Churchâ€™s one foundationâ€ played on a musical box. Nor do I _want_
an Elemental. I only threw open the door. I believe the Thing has come
into my house, and is establishing communication with me. Oh, I want to
go the whole hog. What is it? In the name of Satan, if necessary, what
is it? I just want to know.â€™

       *       *       *       *       *

What followed I thought then might easily be an invention of the
imagination, but what I believed to have happened was this. A piano with
music on it was standing at the far end of the room by the door, and a
sudden draught entered the room, so strong that the leaves turned. Next
the draught troubled a vase of daffodils, and the yellow heads nodded.
Then it reached the candles that stood close to us, and they fluttered,
burning blue and low. Then it reached me, and the draught was cold, and
stirred my hair. Then it eddied, so to speak, and went across to Louis,
and his hair also moved, as I could see. Then it went downwards towards
the fire, and flames suddenly started up in its path, blown upwards. The
rug by the fireplace flapped also.

â€˜Funny, wasnâ€™t it?â€™ he asked.

â€˜And has the Elementa gone up the chimney?â€™ said I.

â€˜Oh, no,â€™ said he, â€˜the Thing only passed us.â€™

Then suddenly he pointed at the wall just behind my chair, and his voice
cracked as he spoke.

â€˜Look, whatâ€™s that?â€™ he said. â€˜There on the wall.â€™

Considerably startled I turned in the direction of his shaking finger.
The wall was pale grey in tone, and sharp-cut against it was a shadow
that, as I looked, moved. It was like the shadow of some enormous slug,
legless and fat, some two feet high by about four feet long. Only at one
end of it was a head shaped like the head of a seal, with open mouth and
panting tongue.

Then even as I looked it faded, and from somewhere close at hand there
sounded another of those shattering knocks.

For a moment after there was silence between us, and horror was thick as
snow in the air. But, somehow neither Louis or I were frightened for
more than one moment. The whole thing was so absorbingly interesting.

â€˜Thatâ€™s what I mean by its being outside my control,â€™ he said. â€˜I said I
was ready for any--any visitor to come in, and by God, weâ€™ve got a
beauty.â€™

       *       *       *       *       *

Now I was still, even in spite of the appearance of this shadow, quite
convinced that I was only taking observations of a most curious case of
disordered brain accompanied by the most vivid and remarkable
thought-transference. I believed that I had not seen a slug-like shadow
at all, but that Louis had visualised this dreadful creature so
intensely that I saw what he saw. I found also that his spiritualistic
trash-books which I thought a truer nomenclature than text-books,
mentioned this as a common form for Elementals to take. He on the other
hand was more firmly convinced than ever that we were dealing not with a
subjective but an objective phenomenon.

       *       *       *       *       *

For the next six months or so we sat constantly, but made no further
progress, nor did the Thing or its shadow appear again, and I began to
feel that we were really wasting time. Then it occurred to me, to get in
a so-called medium, induce hypnotic sleep, and see if we could learn
anything further. This we did, sitting as before round the dining-room
table. The room was not quite dark, and I could see sufficiently clearly
what happened.

The medium, a young man, sat between Louis and myself, and without the
slightest difficulty I put him into a light hypnotic sleep. Instantly
there came a series of the most terrific raps, and across the table
there slid something more palpable than a shadow, with a faint luminance
about it, as if the surface of it was smouldering. At the moment the
mediumâ€™s face became contorted to a mask of hellish terror; mouth and
eyes were both open, and the eyes were focussed on something close to
him. The Thing waving its head came closer and closer to him, and
reached out towards his throat. Then with a yell of panic, and warding
off this horror with his hands, the medium sprang up, but It had already
caught hold, and for the moment he could not get free. Then
simultaneously Louis and I went to his aid, and my hands touched
something cold and slimy. But pull as we could we could not get it away.
There was no firm hand-hold to be taken; it was as if one tried to grasp
slimy fur, and the touch of it was horrible, unclean, like a leper.
Then, in a sort of despair, though I still could not believe that the
horror was real, for it must be a vision of diseased imagination, I
remembered that the switch of the four electric lights was close to my
hand. I turned them all on. There on the floor lay the medium, Louis was
kneeling by him with a face of wet paper, but there was nothing else
there. Only the collar of the medium was crumpled and torn, and on his
throat were two scratches that bled.

The medium was still in hypnotic sleep, and I woke him. He felt at his
collar, put his hand to his throat and found it bleeding, but, as I
expected, knew nothing whatever of what had passed. We told him that
there had been an unusual manifestation, and he had, while in sleep,
wrestled with something. We had got the result we wished for, and were
much obliged to him.

I never saw him again. A week after that he died of blood-poisoning.

       *       *       *       *       *

From that evening dates the second stage of this adventure. The Thing
had materialised (I use again spiritualistic language which I still did
not use at the time). The huge slug, the Elemental, manifested itself
no longer by knocks and waltzing tables, nor yet by shadows. It was
there in a form that could be seen and felt. But it still--this was my
strong point--was only a thing of twilight; the sudden kindling of the
electric light had shown us that there was nothing there. In this
struggle perhaps the medium had clutched his own throat, perhaps I had
grasped Louisâ€™ sleeve, he mine. But though I said these things to
myself, I am not sure that I believed them in the same way that I
believe the sun will rise to-morrow.

Now as a student of brain-functions and a student in hypnotic affairs, I
ought perhaps to have steadily and unremittingly pursued this
extraordinary series of phenomena. But I had my practice to attend to,
and I found that with the best will in the world, I could think of
nothing else except the occurrence in the hall next door. So I refused
to take part in any further sÃ©ance with Louis. I had another reason
also. For the last four or five months he was becoming depraved. I have
been no prude or Puritan in my own life, and I hope I have not turned a
Pharisaical shoulder on sinners. But in all branches of life and morals,
Louis had become infamous. He was turned out of a club for cheating at
cards, and narrated the event to me with gusto. He had become cruel; he
tortured his cat to death; he had become bestial. I used to shudder as I
passed his house, expecting I knew not what fiendish thing to be
looking at me from the window.

Then came a night only a week ago, when I was awakened by an awful cry,
swelling and falling and rising again. It came from next door. I ran
downstairs in my pyjamas, and out into the street. The policeman on the
beat had heard it too, and it came from the hall of Louisâ€™ house, the
window of which was open. Together we burst the door in. You know what
we found. The screaming had ceased but a moment before, but he was dead
already. Both jugulars were severed, torn open.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was dawn, early and dusky when I got back to my house next door. Even
as I went in something seemed to push by me, something soft and slimy.
It could not be Louisâ€™ imagination this time. Since then I have seen
glimpses of it every evening. I am awakened at night by tappings, and in
the shadows in the corner of my room there sits something more
substantial than a shadow.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

Within an hour of my leaving Dr Assheton, the quiet street was once more
aroused by cries of terror and agony. He was already dead, and in no
other manner than his friend, when they got into the house.




THE HOUSE WITH THE BRICK-KILN


The hamlet of Trevor Major lies very lonely and sequestered in a hollow
below the north side of the south downs that stretch westward from
Lewes, and run parallel with the coast. It is a hamlet of some three or
four dozen inconsiderable houses and cottages much girt about with
trees, but the big Norman church and the manor house which stands a
little outside the village are evidence of a more conspicuous past. This
latter, except for a tenancy of rather less than three weeks, now four
years ago, has stood unoccupied since the summer of 1896, and though it
could be taken at a rent almost comically small, it is highly improbable
that either of its last tenants, even if times were very bad, would
think of passing a night in it again. For myself--I was one of the
tenants--I would far prefer living in a workhouse to inhabiting those
low-pitched oak-panelled rooms, and I would sooner look from my garret
windows on to the squalor and grime of Whitechapel than from the
diamond-shaped and leaded panes of the Manor of Trevor Major on to the
boskage of its cool thickets, and the glimmering of its clear
chalk-streams where the quick trout glance among the waving water-weeds
and over the chalk and gravel of its sliding rapids.

It was the news of these trout that led Jack Singleton and myself to
take the house for the month between mid-May and mid-June, but as I have
already mentioned a short three weeks was all the time we passed there,
and we had more than a week of our tenancy yet unexpired when we left
the place, though on the very last afternoon we enjoyed the finest
dry-fly fishing that has ever fallen to my lot. Singleton had originally
seen the advertisement of the house in a Sussex paper, with the
statement that there was good dry-fly fishing belonging to it, but it
was with but faint hopes of the reality of the dry-fly fishing that we
went down to look at the place, since we had before this so often
inspected depopulated ditches which were offered to the unwary under
high-sounding titles. Yet after a half-hourâ€™s stroll by the stream, we
went straight back to the agent, and before nightfall had taken it for a
month with option of renewal.

       *       *       *       *       *

We arrived accordingly from town at about five oâ€™clock on a cloudless
afternoon in May, and through the mists of horror that now stand between
me and the remembrance of what occurred later, I cannot forget the
exquisite loveliness of the impression then conveyed. The garden, it is
true, appeared to have been for years untended; weeds half-choked the
gravel paths, and the flower-beds were a congestion of mingled wild and
cultivated vegetations. It was set in a wall of mellowed brick, in which
snap-dragon and stone-crop had found an anchorage to their liking, and
beyond that there stood sentinel a ring of ancient pines in which the
breeze made music as of a distant sea. Outside that the ground sloped
slightly downwards in a bank covered with a jungle of wild-rose to the
stream that ran round three sides of the garden, and then followed a
meandering course through the two big fields which lay towards the
village. Over all this we had fishing-rights; above, the same rights
extended for another quarter of a mile to the arched bridge, over which
there crossed the road which led to the house. In this field above the
house on the fourth side, where the ground had been embanked to carry
the road, stood a brick-kiln in a ruinous state. A shallow pit, long
overgrown with tall grasses and wild field-flowers, showed where the
clay had been digged.

The house itself was long and narrow; entering, you passed direct into a
square panelled hall, on the left of which was the dining-room which
communicated with the passage leading to the kitchen and offices. On the
right of the hall were two excellent sitting-rooms looking out, the one
on to the gravel in front of the house, the other on to the garden. From
the first of these you could see, through the gap in the pines by which
the road approached the house, the brick-kiln of which I have already
spoken. An oak staircase went up from the hall, and round it ran a
gallery on to which the three principal bedrooms opened. These were
commensurate with the dining-room and the two sitting-rooms below. From
this gallery there led a long narrow passage shut off from the rest of
the house by a red-baize door, which led to a couple more guestrooms and
the servantâ€™s quarters.

Jack Singleton and I share the same flat in town, and we had sent down
in the morning Franklyn and his wife, two old and valued servants, to
get things ready at Trevor Major, and procure help from the village to
look after the house, and Mrs Franklyn with her stout comfortable face
all wreathed in smiles opened the door to us. She had had some previous
experience of the â€œcomfortable quartersâ€ which go with fishing, and had
come down prepared for the worst, but found it all of the best. The
kitchen-boiler was not furred; hot and cold water were laid on in the
most convenient fashion, and could be obtained from taps that neither
stuck nor leaked. Her husband, it appeared, had gone into the village to
buy a few necessaries, and she brought up tea for us, and then went
upstairs to the two rooms over the dining-room and bigger sitting-room,
which we had chosen for our bedrooms, to unpack. The doors of these were
exactly opposite one another to right and left of the gallery, and Jack
who chose the bedroom above the sitting-room had thus a smaller room,
above the second sitting-room, unoccupied, next his and opening out from
it.

We had a couple of hoursâ€™ fishing before dinner, each of us catching
three or four brace of trout, and came back in the dusk to the house.
Franklyn had returned from the village from his errand, reported that he
had got a woman to come in to do housework in the mornings, and
mentioned that our arrival had seemed to arouse a good deal of interest.
The reason for this was obscure; he could only tell us that he was
questioned a dozen times as to whether we really intended to live in the
house, and his assurance that we did produced silence and a shaking of
heads. But the country-folk of Sussex are notable for their silence and
chronic attitude of disapproval, and we put this down to local
idiosyncrasy.

The evening was exquisitely warm, and after dinner we pulled out a
couple of basket-chairs on to the gravel by the front door, and sat for
an hour or so, while the night deepened in throbs of gathering darkness.
The moon was not risen and the ring of pines cut off much of the pale
starlight, so that when we went in, allured by the shining of the lamp
in the sitting-room, it was curiously dark for a clear night in May. And
at that moment of stepping from the darkness into the cheerfulness of
the lighted house, I had a sudden sensation, to which, during the next
fortnight, I became almost accustomed, of there being something unseen
and unheard and dreadful near me. In spite of the warmth, I felt myself
shiver, and concluded instantly that I had sat out-of-doors long enough,
and without mentioning it to Jack, followed him into the smaller
sitting-room in which we had scarcely yet set foot. It like the hall was
oak-panelled, and in the panels hung some half-dozen of water-colour
sketches, which we examined, idly at first, and then with growing
interest, for they were executed with extraordinary finish and delicacy,
and each represented some aspect of the house or garden. Here you looked
up the gap in the fir-trees into a crimson sunset; here the garden, trim
and carefully tended, dozed beneath some languid summer noon; here an
angry wreath of storm-cloud brooded over the meadow where the
trout-stream ran grey and leaden below a threatening sky, while another,
the most careful and arresting of all, was a study of the brick-kiln. In
this, alone of them all, was there a human figure; a man, dressed in
grey, peered into the open door from which issued a fierce red glow. The
figure was painted with miniature-like elaboration; the face was in
profile, and represented a youngish man, clean-shaven with a long
aquiline nose and singularly square chin. The sketch was long and narrow
in shape, and the chimney of the kiln appeared against a dark sky. From
it there issued a thin streamer of grey smoke.

Jack looked at this with attention.

â€œWhat a horrible picture,â€ he said, â€œand how beautifully painted. I feel
as if it meant something, as if it was a representation of something
that happened, not a mere sketch. By Jove!----â€

He broke off suddenly, and went in turn to each of the other pictures.

â€œThatâ€™s a queer thing,â€ he said. â€œSee if you notice what I mean.â€

With the brick-kiln rather vividly impressed on my mind, it was not
difficult to see what he had noticed. In each of the pictures appeared
the brick-kiln, chimney and all, now seen faintly between trees, now in
full view, and in each the chimney was smoking.

â€œAnd the odd part is that from the garden side, you canâ€™t really see the
kiln at all,â€ observed Jack, â€œitâ€™s hidden by the house, and yet the
artist F. A., as I see by his signature, puts it in just the same.â€

â€œWhat do you make of that?â€ I asked.

â€œNothing. I suppose he had a fancy for brick-kilns. Letâ€™s have a game of
picquet.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

A fortnight of our three weeks passed without incident, except that
again and again the curious feeling of something dreadful being close at
hand was present in my mind. In a way, as I said, I got used to it, but
on the other hand the feeling itself seemed to gain in poignancy. Once
just at the end of the fortnight I mentioned it to Jack.

â€œOdd you should speak of it,â€ he said, â€œbecause Iâ€™ve felt the same. When
do you feel it? Do you feel it now for instance?â€

We were again sitting out after dinner, and as he spoke I felt it with
far greater intensity than ever before. And at the same moment the
house-door which had been closed, though probably not latched, swung
gently open, letting out a shaft of light from the hall, and as gently
swung to again, as if something had stealthily entered.

â€œYes,â€ I said. â€œI felt it then. I only feel it in the evening. It was
rather bad that time.â€

Jack was silent a moment.

â€œFunny thing the door opening and shutting like that,â€ he said. â€œLetâ€™s
go indoors.â€

We got up and I remember seeing at that moment that the windows of my
bedroom were lit; Mrs Franklyn probably was making things ready for the
night. Simultaneously, as we crossed the gravel, there came from just
inside the house the sound of a hurried footstep on the stairs, and
entering we found Mrs Franklyn in the hall, looking rather white and
startled.

â€œAnything wrong?â€ I asked.

She took two or three quick breaths before she answered:

â€œNo, sir,â€ she said, â€œat least nothing that I can give an account of. I
was tidying up in your room, and I thought you came in. But there was
nobody, and it gave me a turn. I left my candle there; I must go up for
it.â€

I waited in the hall a moment, while she again ascended the stairs, and
passed along the gallery to my room. At the door, which I could see was
open, she paused, not entering.

â€œWhat is the matter?â€ I asked from below.

â€œI left the candle alight,â€ she said, â€œand itâ€™s gone out.â€

Jack laughed.

â€œAnd you left the door and window open,â€ said he.

â€œYes, sir, but not a breath of wind is stirring,â€ said Mrs Franklyn,
rather faintly.

This was true, and yet a few moments ago the heavy hall-door had swung
open and back again. Jack ran upstairs.

â€œWeâ€™ll brave the dark together, Mrs Franklyn,â€ he said.

He went into my room, and I heard the sound of a match struck. Then
through the open door came the light of the rekindled candle and
simultaneously I heard a bell ring in the servantâ€™s quarters. In a
moment came steps, and Franklyn appeared.

â€œWhat bell was that?â€ I asked.

â€œMr Jackâ€™s bedroom, sir,â€ he said.

I felt there was a marked atmosphere of nerves about for which there was
really no adequate cause. All that had happened of a disturbing nature
was that Mrs Franklyn had thought I had come into my bedroom, and had
been startled by finding I had not. She had then left the candle in a
draught, and it had been blown out. As for a bell ringing, that, even if
it had happened, was a very innocuous proceeding.

â€œMouse on a wire,â€ I said. â€œMr Jack is in my room this moment lighting
Mrs Franklynâ€™s candle for her.â€

Jack came down at this juncture, and we went into the sitting-room. But
Franklyn apparently was not satisfied, for we heard him in the room
above us, which was Jackâ€™s bedroom, moving about with his slow and
rather ponderous tread. Then his steps seemed to pass into the bedroom
adjoining, and we heard no more.

I remember feeling hugely sleepy that night, and went to bed earlier
than usual, to pass rather a broken night with stretches of dreamless
sleep interspersed with startled awakenings, in which I passed very
suddenly into complete consciousness. Sometimes the house was absolutely
still, and the only sound to be heard was the sighing of the night
breeze outside in the pines, but sometimes the place seemed full of
muffled movements, and once I could have sworn that the handle of my
door turned. That required verification, and I lit my candle, but found
that my ears must have played me false. Yet even as I stood there, I
thought I heard steps just outside, and with a considerable qualm, I
must confess, I opened the door and looked out. But the gallery was
quite empty, and the house quite still. Then from Jackâ€™s room opposite I
heard a sound that was somehow comforting, the snorts of the snorer, and
I went back to bed and slept again, and when next I woke, morning was
already breaking in red lines on the horizon, and the sense of trouble
that had been with me ever since last evening had gone.

Heavy rain set in after lunch next day, and as I had arrears of
letter-writing to do, and the water was soon both muddy and rising, I
came home alone about five, leaving Jack still sanguine by the stream,
and worked for a couple of hours sitting at a writing-table in the room
overlooking the gravel at the front of the house, where hung the
water-colours. By seven I had finished, and just as I got up to light
candles, since it was already dusk, I saw, as I thought, Jackâ€™s figure
emerge from the bushes that bordered the path to the stream, on to the
space in front of the house. Then instantaneously and with a sudden
queer sinking of the heart, quite unaccountable, I saw that it was not
Jack at all, but a stranger. He was only some six yards from the window,
and after pausing there a moment he came close up to the window, so that
his face nearly touched the glass, looking intently at me. In the light
from the freshly-kindled candles I could distinguish his features with
great clearness, but though, as far as I knew, I had never seen him
before, there was something familiar about both his face and figure. He
appeared to smile at me, but the smile was one of inscrutable evil and
malevolence, and immediately he walked on, straight towards the
house-door opposite him, and out of sight of the sitting-room window.

Now, little though I liked the look of the man, he was, as I have said,
familiar to my eye, and I went out into the hall, since he was clearly
coming to the front-door, to open it to him and learn his business. So
without waiting for him to ring, I opened it, feeling sure I should find
him on the step. Instead, I looked out into the empty gravel-sweep, the
heavy-falling rain, the thick dusk. And even as I looked, I felt
something that I could not see push by me through the half-opened door
and pass into the house. Then the stairs creaked, and a moment after a
bell rang.

Franklyn is the quickest man to answer a bell I have ever seen, and next
instant he passed me going upstairs. He tapped at Jackâ€™s door, entered,
and then came down again.

â€œMr Jack still out, sir?â€ he asked.

â€œYes. His bell ringing again?â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ said Franklyn, quite imperturbably.

I went back into the sitting-room, and soon Franklyn brought a lamp. He
put it on the table above which hung the careful and curious picture of
the brick-kiln, and then with a sudden horror I saw why the stranger on
the gravel outside had been so familiar to me. In all respects he
resembled the figure that peered into the kiln; it was more than a
resemblance, it was an identity. And what had happened to this man who
had inscrutably and evilly smiled at me? And what had pushed in through
the half-closed door?

At that moment I saw the face of Fear; my mouth went dry, and I heard my
heart leaping and cracking in my throat. That face was only turned on me
for a moment, and then away again, but I knew it to be the genuine
thing; not apprehension, not foreboding, not a feeling of being
startled, but Fear, cold Fear. And then though nothing had occurred to
assuage the Fear, it passed, and a certain sort of reason usurped--for
so I must say--its place. I had certainly seen somebody on the gravel
outside the house; I had supposed he was going to the front-door. I had
opened it, and found he had not come to the front-door. Or--and once
again the terror resurged--had the invisible pushing thing been that
which I had seen outside? And if so, what was it? And how came it that
the face and figure of the man I had seen was the same as that which was
so scrupulously painted in the picture of the brick-kiln?

I set myself to argue down the Fear for which there was no more
foundation than this, this and the repetition of the ringing bell, and
my belief is that I did so. I told myself, till I believed it, that a
man--a human man--had been walking across the gravel outside, and that
he had not come to the front-door but had gone, as he might easily have
done, up the drive into the high-road. I told myself that it was mere
fancy that was the cause of the belief that Something had pushed in by
me, and as for the ringing of the bell, I said to myself, as was true,
that this had happened before. And I must ask the reader to believe also
that I argued these things away, and looked no longer on the face of
Fear itself. I was not comfortable, but I fell short of being terrified.

I sat down again by the window looking on to the gravel in front of the
house, and finding another letter that asked, though it did not demand
an answer, proceeded to occupy myself with it. Straight in front led the
drive through the gap in the pines, and passed through the field where
lay the brick-kiln. In a pause of page-turning I looked up and saw
something unusual about it; at the same moment an unusual smell came to
my nostril. What I saw was smoke coming out of the chimney of the kiln,
what I smelt was the odour of roasting meat. The wind--such as there
was--set from the kiln to the house. But as far as I knew the smell of
roast meat probably came from the kitchen where dinner, so I supposed,
was cooking. I had to tell myself this: I wanted reassurance, lest the
face of Fear should look whitely on me again.

Then there came a crisp step on the gravel, a rattle at the front-door,
and Jack came in.

â€œGood sport,â€ he said, â€œyou gave up too soon.â€

And he went straight to the table above which hung the picture of the
man at the brick-kiln, and looked at it. Then there was silence; and
eventually I spoke, for I wanted to know one thing.

â€œSeen anybody?â€ I asked.

â€œYes. Why do you ask?â€

â€œBecause I have also; the man in that picture.â€

Jack came and sat down near me.

â€œItâ€™s a ghost, you know,â€ he said. â€œHe came down to the river about dusk
and stood near me for an hour. At first I thought he was--was real, and
I warned him that he had better stand further off if he didnâ€™t want to
be hooked. And then it struck me he wasnâ€™t real, and I cast, well, right
through him, and about seven he walked up towards the house.â€

â€œWere you frightened?â€

â€œNo. It was so tremendously interesting. So you saw him here too.
Whereabouts?â€

â€œJust outside. I think he is in the house now.â€

Jack looked round.

â€œDid you see him come in?â€ he asked.

â€œNo, but I felt him. Thereâ€™s another queer thing too; the chimney of the
brick-kiln is smoking.â€

Jack looked out of the window. It was nearly dark but the wreathing
smoke could just be seen.

â€œSo it is,â€ he said, â€œfat, greasy smoke. I think Iâ€™ll go up and see
whatâ€™s on. Come too?â€

â€œI think not,â€ I said.

â€œAre you frightened? It isnâ€™t worth while. Besides, it is so
tremendously interesting.â€

Jack came back from his little expedition still interested. He had found
nothing stirring at the kiln, but though it was then nearly dark the
interior was faintly luminous, and against the black of the sky he could
see a wisp of thick white smoke floating northwards. But for the rest of
the evening we neither heard nor saw anything of abnormal import, and
the next day ran a course of undisturbed hours. Then suddenly a hellish
activity was manifested.

That night, while I was undressing for bed, I heard a bell ring
furiously, and I thought I heard a shout also. I guessed where the ring
came from, since Franklyn and his wife had long ago gone to bed, and
went straight to Jackâ€™s room. But as I tapped at the door I heard his
voice from inside calling loud to me. â€œTake care,â€ it said, â€œheâ€™s close
to the door.â€

A sudden qualm of blank fear took hold of me, but mastering it as best I
could, I opened the door to enter, and once again something pushed
softly by me, though I saw nothing.

Jack was standing by his bed, half-undressed. I saw him wipe his
forehead with the back of his hand.

â€œHeâ€™s been here again,â€ he said. â€œI was standing just here, a minute
ago, when I found him close by me. He came out of the inner room, I
think. Did you see what he had in his hand?â€

â€œI saw nothing.â€

â€œIt was a knife; a great long carving knife. Do you mind my sleeping on
the sofa in your room to-night? I got an awful turn then. There was
another thing too. All round the edge of his clothes, at his collar and
at his wrists, there were little flames playing, little white licking
flames.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

But next day, again, we neither heard nor saw anything, nor that night
did the sense of that dreadful presence in the house come to us. And
then came the last day. We had been out till it was dark, and as I said,
had a wonderful day among the fish. On reaching home we sat together in
the sitting-room, when suddenly from overhead came a tread of feet, a
violent pealing of the bell, and the moment after yell after yell as of
someone in mortal agony. The thought occurred to both of us that this
might be Mrs Franklyn in terror of some fearful sight, and together we
rushed up and sprang into Jackâ€™s bedroom.

The doorway into the room beyond was open, and just inside it we saw the
man bending over some dark huddled object. Though the room was dark we
could see him perfectly, for a light stale and impure seemed to come
from him. He had again a long knife in his hand, and as we entered he
was wiping it on the mass that lay at his feet. Then he took it up, and
we saw what it was, a woman with head nearly severed. But it was not Mrs
Franklyn.

And then the whole thing vanished, and we were standing looking into a
dark and empty room. We went downstairs without a word, and it was not
till we were both in the sitting-room below that Jack spoke.

â€œAnd he takes her to the brick-kiln,â€ he said rather unsteadily. â€œI say,
have you had enough of this house? I have. There is hell in it.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

About a week later Jack put into my hand a guidebook to Sussex open at
the description of Trevor Major, and I read:

â€œJust outside the village stands the picturesque manor house, once the
home of the artist and notorious murderer, Francis Adam. It was here he
killed his wife, in a fit, it is believed, of groundless jealousy,
cutting her throat and disposing of her remains by burning them in a
brick-kiln. Certain charred fragments found six months afterwards led to
his arrest and execution.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

So I prefer to leave the house with the brick-kiln and the pictures
signed F. A. to others.

THE LURE

BY

E. S. STEVENS

Author of â€œThe Veilâ€ and â€œThe Mountain of God,â€ etc.

_Crown 8vo_, =6s.=


The lure of adventure, the lure of a strong and unscrupulous
personality, and the lure of the Dark Continent, play their parts in
this story. Anne, the woman of the book, comes under the influence of
all three, to learn at the last that they have only enchained her
imagination and not her heart. A great part of this notable novel takes
place in the less known parts of the Soudan, where the main actors in
the drama meet and work out their destinies. The background is that vast
land of the elephant, the crocodile, and the hippopotamus, where
solitary Englishmen are loyally serving their country and civilisation,
without vainglory or hope of reward. THE LURE will be one of the most
remarkable novels of 1912.

_A Remarkable Indian Romance_

THE DAUGHTER OF BRAHMA

By I. A. R. WYLIE

Author of â€œThe Rajahâ€™s Peopleâ€ and â€œDividing Watersâ€

_Crown 8vo_, =6s.=


In THE DAUGHTER OF BRAHMA we are transported back to the mysterious
atmosphere and brilliant Oriental colourings which marked the authorâ€™s
first novel, â€œThe Rajahâ€™s People.â€ But here the complications of race
and religion in India are faced from another standpoint--that of the
woman. With profound sympathy we follow the wonderful moral and
spiritual growth of the daughter of Brahma, whose fate becomes so
strangely linked with that of the hero. With an equal interest,
moreover, the reader is led step by step through an absorbing plot, in
which all the hidden religious and political life of India is revealed
in striking colours, until the final crisis is reached. The crisis,
indeed, is an intensely dramatic and tragic one; but it satisfies not
only by its truth, but by the promise of future happiness which it
brings with it. The story draws into it many minor characters, who, like
the two chief figures, win both interest and sympathy by their
originality and life-like portraiture.

     _Mills & Boon confidently recommend THE DAUGHTER OF BRAHMA as one
     of the finest novels of 1912._

_A Notable Novel_

Some years ago there appeared a very notable novel which Mills & Boon
believe has got lost sight of in the rush of Fiction so energetically
published by almost every firm. It was entitled--


AN ENGLISHMAN

By MARY PENDERED

How many readers of to-day remember it? Mills & Boon will shortly issue
a new and revised edition at =6s.=, and they hope the public will not miss
this chance of reading one of the finest novels of the last fifteen
years. Some reviews are here given which appeared when the book was
originally published.

     â€œWe have nothing but admiration for this very noble book. It is by
     far the most important the season has yet produced. It is filled
     with wisdom and sympathy, and in the Englishman of the title the
     author has created a _man_.â€--_Literary World._

            *       *       *       *       *

     Times._

            *       *       *       *       *

     â€œA thoroughly wholesome, sympathetic, effective story, the interest
     of which is sustained with unbroken continuity from its opening to
     its close.... Handled with remarkable adroitness, and manifesting
     no inconsiderable originality of characterisation.

     â€œMiss Penderedâ€™s â€˜Englishmanâ€™ possesses that width of observation
     and simplicity of purpose which lift it far above the
     average.â€--_Daily Telegraph._

MY GERMAN YEAR

By I. A. R. WYLIE

AUTHOR OF â€œIN DIFFERENT KEYS,â€ â€œDIVIDING WATERS,â€ â€œTHE RAJAHâ€™S PEOPLE,â€
ETC.

With 2 Illustrations in colour, and 18 from Photographs
Second Edition. Demy 8vo. =10s. 6d.= net

The _Westminster Gazette_ has reviewed â€œMy German Yearâ€ as â€œa vivid,
attractive, and really informing volume,â€ and also as â€œwise,
well-informed, and very readable, with some delightful fresh information
and shrewd criticisms.â€ Also saying: â€œWe close â€˜My German Yearâ€™ with a
feeling of gratitude for very good entertainment all through, and with a
sense that though on a good many minor points the writer is led by her
enthusiasm to see matters in a far too roseate light, she has used her
brain and her eyes to good purpose during her â€˜German Year,â€™ and has
written a book which suffers in no way by the fact that the last few
years have seen the publication in this country of several volumes on
the same subject.â€

The _Evening Standard_ (also a lengthy notice) said: â€œWe have seldom
read a more interesting book than â€˜My German Year.â€™ Miss Wylieâ€™s words
are often bitter to the taste, still more bitter very often is what she
leaves unsaid, the obvious inferences she hands on to us to draw, but it
is all extremely salutary, and should be read by every householder in
the land.â€


MY ITALIAN YEAR

By RICHARD BAGOT

AUTHOR OF â€œCASTING OF NETS,â€ â€œA ROMAN MYSTERY,â€ â€œDONNA DIANAâ€ â€œTHE LAKES
OF NORTHERN ITALY,â€ â€œTHE HOUSE OF SERRAVALLE,â€ ETC.

With 25 Illustrations
Second Edition. Demy 8vo. =10s. 6d.= net

_Daily Mail._--â€œIt is this new Italy--the country of the future and not
of the past--which forms the subject of Mr Bagotâ€™s absorbingly
interesting pages. Twenty yearsâ€™ residence in the country and a sound
knowledge of its language have enabled Mr Bagot to penetrate deeply into
the character not only of the Italian in general, but of the numerous
races that form the Italian nation; to form a just estimate of Italian
institutions, politics, social life, customs, and aspirations. He does
this with absolute impartiality, distributing praise and blame from the
vantage-point of his exceptional experience. For Mr Bagot appears to
have explored every corner of the country, and to have associated with
every class of its population.â€

_Daily Telegraph._--â€œIt is a thoughtful, knowledgeful book that Mr Bagot
has given us, and one that intending visitors to Italy will do well to
read and ponder over.â€

_Daily Graphic._--â€œMr Bagotâ€™s book is a highly interesting and
sympathetic description of Italian life in all its phases.â€

SyvyydessÃ¤.


Luutnantti seisoi terÃ¤spallon Ã¤Ã¤ressÃ¤ pureksien mÃ¤nnynlastua. "MitÃ¤
arvelette siitÃ¤, Steevens?" kysyi hÃ¤n. "Onpa siinÃ¤ ajatus", sanoi
Steevens avosydÃ¤misesti.

"MinÃ¤ luulen sen menevÃ¤n lyttyyn -- lÃ¤ts", sanoi luutnantti.

"HÃ¤n nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ jo laskeneen kaikki aivan tarkalleen", sanoi Steevens,
tarttumatta vielÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n asiaan.

"Mutta ajatelkaa toki painetta", sanoi luutnantti. "Veden pinnalla on
neljÃ¤toista naulaa tuumalla, kolmekymmentÃ¤ jalkaa alempana kaksi kertaa
niin paljo; kuusikymmentÃ¤, kolme; yhdeksÃ¤nkymmentÃ¤, neljÃ¤ kertaa;
yhdeksÃ¤nsataa neljÃ¤kymmentÃ¤ kertaa; viisituhatta kolmesataa --
peninkulma -- on kaksisataa neljÃ¤kymmentÃ¤ kertaa neljÃ¤toista naulaa; se
on -- odottakaas -- kolmekymmentÃ¤ sentneriÃ¤ -- puolitoista tonnia,
Steevens; puolitoista tonnia neliÃ¶tuumalla. Ja valtameri, johon sen
tulee sukeltaa, on viisi peninkulmaa syvÃ¤. Siis seitsemÃ¤n ja puoli --"

"Tuntuuhan se", sanoi Steevens, "mutta on tuo terÃ¤skin aika paksua."

Luutnantti ei vastannut, alkoi vaan jÃ¤lleen pureksia mÃ¤nnynlastua.
HeidÃ¤n keskustelunsa esine oli suuri terÃ¤spallo, jonka halkasija oli
ehkÃ¤ yhdeksÃ¤n jalkaa. Se nÃ¤ytti jÃ¤ttilÃ¤ismÃ¤iseltÃ¤ tykinkuulalta. Se oli
sijoitettu mukavasti hirveÃ¤n suurille telineille laivan kokkapuolella
ja suunnattomat parrut, joitten piti auttaa sen veteen laskemista
tekivÃ¤t laivan omituisen nÃ¤kÃ¶iseksi. Kahdessa kohden oli terÃ¤ksessÃ¤
pari tavattoman paksulasista ikkunaa. Yksi niistÃ¤, tavattoman paksuine
terÃ¤skehyksineen, oli ruuvattu puoleksi auki. Molemmat miehet olivat
nÃ¤hneet pallon sisustan tÃ¤nÃ¤ aamuna ensi kerran. Se oli mukavasti
sisustettu, ilmapatjoja ylt'ympÃ¤ri ja pullistuneitten tyynyjen vÃ¤lissÃ¤
pieniÃ¤ nappeja. NiistÃ¤ hoidettiin laitoksen koneistoa. Kaikki oli
peitetty pehmeÃ¤llÃ¤, yksin Myerin aparaattikin, jonka tuli imeÃ¤ itseensÃ¤
hiilihappoa ja korvata laitoksen johtajan kÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤ happi, sitten kun
hÃ¤n kiipeisi sisÃ¤Ã¤n tuosta miehenmentÃ¤vÃ¤stÃ¤ ikkunanreiÃ¤stÃ¤ ja lasi
ruuvattaisiin kiinni.

Koko laitos oli niin huolellisesti tyynytetty, ettÃ¤ sitÃ¤ olisi voinut
ampua tykillÃ¤ eikÃ¤ sisÃ¤ssÃ¤ olevalla olisi ollut mitÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤tÃ¤Ã¤. Ja niin
sen pitikin, sillÃ¤ jonkun tunnin kuluttua ryÃ¶misi sinne tuosta
lasinreiÃ¤stÃ¤ mies, lasi ruuvattaisiin kiinni, pallo mereen ja sitten
alaspÃ¤in -- alaspÃ¤in aina vaan, viisi peninkulmaa, kuten luutnantti
sanoi. Se oli kiintynyt kovasti hÃ¤nen mieleensÃ¤; se pani pÃ¤Ã¤n ihan
pyÃ¶rÃ¤lle. Sitten hÃ¤n tapasi Steevensin, Ã¤sken laivalle tulleen, ja piti
hÃ¤ntÃ¤ sopivana keskustelutoverina. Asia alettiin aina alusta.

"Mutta luulen", sanoi luutnantti, "ettÃ¤ lasi aivan yksinkertaisesti
taipuu sisÃ¤Ã¤n, murtuu ja menee mÃ¤sÃ¤ksi sellaisessa paineessa. On sitÃ¤
saatu kivikin juoksemaan vetenÃ¤ kovan paineen alla -- ja huomatkaa mitÃ¤
sanoin."

"Jos lasi murtuu", sanoi Steevens, "mitÃ¤ sitten?"

"Vesi syÃ¶ksyy sisÃ¤Ã¤n kuin rautasuihku. Oletteko koskaan saanut kokea
kovapaineisen veden suihkua? Se kerrassaan musertaisi hÃ¤net. Se
tunkeutuisi hÃ¤nen kurkkuunsa ja keuhkoihinsa, syÃ¶ksyisi korviin --"

"Onpas TeillÃ¤ seikkaperÃ¤inen mielikuvitus!" arveli Steevens, joka nÃ¤ki
kaikki aivan elÃ¤vÃ¤sti tapahtuvan.

"VÃ¤lttÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n todeksi havaitsemista vaan", sanoi luutnantti.

"EntÃ¤s pallo?"

"Muutaman kuplan synnyttÃ¤isi ja asettuisi mukavasti pohjaan
tuomiopÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ odottelemaan, istuisi sinne liejuun ja pohjamutaan.
Elstead parka olisi vaan hajallaan halenneitten tyynyjensÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ kuin
voi leivÃ¤llÃ¤."

HÃ¤n kertasi viime lauseensa. Se miellytti hÃ¤ntÃ¤ aivan nÃ¤htÃ¤vÃ¤sti. "Kuin
voi leivÃ¤llÃ¤." "Luukkuako tarkastellaan?" kuului Ã¤Ã¤ni kysyvÃ¤n. Elstead
siellÃ¤ seisoi heidÃ¤n takanaan valkoseen puettuna kiireestÃ¤ kantapÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤n.
Paperossi oli hÃ¤nellÃ¤ hampaissa ja silmÃ¤t hymyilivÃ¤t leveÃ¤n hatunreunan
alta. "MitÃ¤ Te voista ja leivÃ¤stÃ¤ juttuatte, Weybridge? Taasko moititte
meriupseerien riittÃ¤mÃ¤tÃ¶ntÃ¤ palkkaa? Minulla ei ole enÃ¤Ã¤ kuin yksi
pÃ¤ivÃ¤ lÃ¤htÃ¶Ã¶ni. Saamme kÃ¶ydet tÃ¤nÃ¤Ã¤n kuntoon. Nuo harvat pilven
hattarat ja kevyt aallonkÃ¤ynti sopivat juuri mainiosti, kun tÃ¤ssÃ¤
heitetÃ¤Ã¤n tusinan verta tonneja lyijyÃ¤ ja rautaa mereen, eikÃ¶ niin?"

"Ei ne TeitÃ¤ juuri hÃ¤iritse", sanoi Weybridge.

"Ei. SeitsemÃ¤n -- kahdeksankymmenen jalan syvyydessÃ¤ ei ole liikettÃ¤
lainkaan ja sinne minÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤sen kahdessatoista sekunnissa. Antaa sitten
tuulen ulvoa itsensÃ¤ kÃ¤heÃ¤ksi tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ pinnalla ja veden nousta vaikka
yli pilvien. Ei. Tuolla alhaalla on --." HÃ¤n siirtyi laivan syrjÃ¤lle.
Toiset tulivat perÃ¤ssÃ¤. Kaikki kolme kumartuivat eteenpÃ¤in ja
tuijottivat vihreÃ¤nkeltaiseen veteen.

"_Rauha_", sanoi Elstead, pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤en lauseensa.

"Oletteko vallan varma, ettÃ¤ kellolaitos tekee tehtÃ¤vÃ¤nsÃ¤?" kysyi
Weybridge.

"Se on toiminut kolmekymmentÃ¤ viisi tuntia", sanoi Elstead. "Toimimaan
se on tehtykin."

"Mutta jos se ei toimisi?"

"Miksei se sitÃ¤ tekisi?"

"En minÃ¤ menisi mereen tuossa kirotussa kapineessa", sanoi Weybridge,
"en, vaikka tarjottaisiin kaksisataatuhatta puntaa."

"Olettepa arka poika", sanoi Elstead ja sylkÃ¤si tuttavallisesti alas
veteen.

"En minÃ¤ vain ymmÃ¤rrÃ¤, miten Te aijotte tuota laitosta kÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤", sanoi
Steevens.

"EnsinnÃ¤kin, minut ruuvataan palloon", sanoi Elstead, "ja kun minÃ¤ olen
sytyttÃ¤nyt ja sammuttanut sÃ¤hkÃ¶valon kolmeen kertaan nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤kseni, ettÃ¤
olen kunnossa, heittÃ¤Ã¤ tuo nostolaitos minut mereen ja kaikki nuo
raskaat lyijypainot tulevat perÃ¤ssÃ¤. Suurimmassa lyijypainossa on
rulla, jolla on sata syltÃ¤ lujaa kÃ¶yttÃ¤, ja muuta yhdistÃ¤jÃ¤Ã¤ ei
painoilla ja pallolla olekaan paitsi siteitÃ¤, jotka katkaistaan
lÃ¤hdettÃ¤issÃ¤. On parempi kÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ kÃ¶yttÃ¤ kuin monikertaista
metallilankaa. Se katkee helpommin ja on taipuisampaa -- tÃ¤rkeitÃ¤
asioita, kuten kohta havaitsette."

"Jokaisessa lyijypainossa nÃ¤ette reijÃ¤n, sen lÃ¤pi juoksee rautainen
kanki, tullen noin kuusi jalkaa ulos alapuolelta. Jos tuo kanki kohoaa,
nostaa se vivun ja panee kÃ¤yntiin kellolaitoksen siinÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤ lieriÃ¶tÃ¤,
jolle kÃ¶ysi kiertyy."

"No niin. Koko laitos lasketaan koreasti veteen ja siteet katkaistaan.
Pallo ui -- siinÃ¤ on ilmaa, se on vettÃ¤ keveÃ¤mpi -- mutta lyijypainot
putoavat heti alas ja kÃ¶ysi juoksee. Kun kÃ¶ysi on aivan suora lÃ¤htee
pallokin sen vetÃ¤mÃ¤nÃ¤ alaspÃ¤in."

"Mutta miksi Te kÃ¶yden laitoitte?" kysyi Steevens. "Miksette
kiinnittÃ¤nyt painoja suoraan palloon?"

"Pohjaan kolahtamisen tÃ¤hden. Koko laitos menee alas hyvÃ¤Ã¤ kyytiÃ¤,
peninkulman toisensa jÃ¤lkeen, viimein on vauhti aivan tavaton. Se
pirstaantuisi pohjaa vasten, ellei tÃ¤tÃ¤ kÃ¶yttÃ¤ olisi. Nyt iskevÃ¤t
painot pohjaan. Heti kun ne sen ovat tehneet, tulee pallon uintikyky
kysymykseen. Se kulkee pohjaa kohti yhÃ¤ hitaammin, seisahtuu vihdoin ja
alkaa uida taas ylÃ¶spÃ¤in."

"Nyt tulee kellolaitos kysymykseen. Heti kun painot puskevat pohjaan,
luistaa kanki lÃ¤pi ja panee kellolaitoksen kÃ¤yntiin. KÃ¶ysi kiertyy
jÃ¤lleen rullalleen. MinÃ¤ laskeudun siten pohjalle. SiellÃ¤ minÃ¤ sitten
viivyn puoli tuntia, sytytÃ¤n sÃ¤hkÃ¶n ja katselen ympÃ¤rilleni. Sitten
kellolaitos naksauttaa taittoveitsen, kÃ¶ysi katkee ja minÃ¤ syÃ¶ksyn
jÃ¤lleen ylÃ¶s kuin soodavesikupla. KÃ¶ysikin auttaa vaan."

"EntÃ¤ jos sattuisitte laivan kohdalle?" kysÃ¤si Weybridge.

"MinÃ¤ tulisin sellaista vauhtia, ettÃ¤ menisin koreasti sen lÃ¤pi", sanoi
Elstead, "menisin kuin tykin luoti. Ei TeidÃ¤n siitÃ¤ tarvitse olla
huolissanne."

"Otaksukaamme, ettÃ¤ joku vÃ¤kevÃ¤ rapuelÃ¤in kietoutuisi
kellolaitokseenne."

"Se olisi minulle kiireellinen kehoitus pysÃ¤htyÃ¤", sanoi Elstead,
kÃ¤Ã¤ntyen katselemaan palloa.

       *       *       *       *       *

Kello yhdentoista tienoissa oli Elstead heitetty mereen. PÃ¤ivÃ¤ oli
selkeÃ¤n kirkas ja tyyni, taivaanrannalla oli sumua. SÃ¤hkÃ¶valo tuikahti
iloisesti kolme kertaa pienessÃ¤ ylÃ¤-osastossa. Sitten he laskivat hÃ¤net
hitaasti veden pintaan ja kokkakÃ¶ysillÃ¤ seisova mies oli valmiina
leikkaamaan poikki palloa ja painoja yhdistÃ¤vÃ¤t siteet. Pallo, joka
kannella oli nÃ¤yttÃ¤nyt niin isolta, oli mitÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n pienen nÃ¤kÃ¶inen
tullessaan laivan keulan alle. Se keikkui hiukan ja sen kaksi tummaa
ikkunaa, jotka olivat ylÃ¤puolella, nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t ihmetellen katselevan
laivan reunalla tunkeilevaa vÃ¤keÃ¤. ErÃ¤s Ã¤Ã¤ni ihmetteli, miltÃ¤
Elsteadista tuo keikkuminen tuntuu.

"Oletteko valmiit?" kuului kapteeni huutavan.

"Ollaan, ollaan, sir!"

"Antaa sitten mennÃ¤!"

KÃ¶ydet katkaistiin, pyÃ¶rre myllersi pallon ympÃ¤rillÃ¤ avuttoman
hauskasti. Katsojista joku heilutti nenÃ¤liinaansa, joku koetti huutaa
ja erÃ¤s kadetti laski hitaasti, "kahdeksan, yhdeksÃ¤n, kymmenen!" VielÃ¤
keikahdus ja koko laitos suoristui Ã¤kkiÃ¤.

Se nÃ¤ytti jÃ¤Ã¤vÃ¤n hetkeksi paikoilleen ja pienenevÃ¤n nopeasti. Sitten
vesi sen nielasi, se nÃ¤kyi vielÃ¤ pinnan alla, heijastuksen
suurentamana. Ennenkuin ehti kolmeen laskea, oli se kadonnut. LÃ¤ikettÃ¤
ja kirkkaita aaltoja jÃ¤i vielÃ¤ jÃ¤lkeen. Nekin pienenivÃ¤t ja hÃ¤ipyivÃ¤t.
Sitten ei nÃ¤kynyt muuta kuin syvÃ¤ vesi, joka alempana nÃ¤ytti aivan
mustalta. SiellÃ¤ uiskenteli hai.

Sitten alkoi risteilijÃ¤ liikkua, vesi myllertyi, hai katosi,
vaahtovirta ryÃ¶psÃ¤hti yli tuon kristallikirkkaan syvyyden, joka oli
niellyt Elsteadin. "MikÃ¤ on tarkotuksena?" kysyi erÃ¤s merimies
toveriltaan.

"Me asetumme muutaman peninkulman pÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤n, ettei hÃ¤n ylÃ¶s tullessaan
puske meihin", vastasi toinen.

Alus kulki hitaasti uuteen paikkaansa. Sen kannella katseli joka-ainoa,
joka oli jouten, tuota keinuvaa syvyyttÃ¤, jonne pallo oli uponnut.
EnsimÃ¤isenÃ¤ puolena tuntina puhuttiin tuskin yhtÃ¤Ã¤n sanaa, joka ei
olisi koskenut Elsteadia. Joulukuun aurinko oli nyt korkealla ja
kuumuus melkoinen.

"HÃ¤nen on jokseenkin viileÃ¤ tuolla alhaalla", sanoi Weybridge.
"Sanotaan, ettÃ¤ jossain mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤tyssÃ¤ syvyydessÃ¤ merivesi on aina
jÃ¤Ã¤tymÃ¤isillÃ¤Ã¤n."

"MistÃ¤ hÃ¤n tulee ylÃ¶s?" kysyi Steevens. "Minulta on suunta kateissa."

"Tuolta noin", sanoi kapteeni, joka ylpeili kaikkitietÃ¤vÃ¤isyydestÃ¤Ã¤n.
HÃ¤n ojensi sormen suoraan kaakkoon. "Ja nyt on luullakseni oikea
aikakin", sanoi hÃ¤n. "HÃ¤n on ollut kolmekymmentÃ¤ viisi minuttia."

"PitkÃ¤kÃ¶ aika menee, ennenkuin ehtii valtameren pohjaan?" kysyi
Steevens.

"Viiden peninkulman syvyyteen ja laskien -- kuten teimme -- nopeuden
lisÃ¤yksen kahdeksi jalaksi sekunnilta, menee menoon ja paluuseen noin
kolme neljÃ¤nnesminuttia."

"HÃ¤n on siis jo ollut liiankin kauvan", sanoi Weybridge.

"MelkeinpÃ¤", sanoi kapteeni. "MinÃ¤ otaksun kuluvan muutamia minutteja
tuon kÃ¶yden kiertÃ¤miseen."

"SitÃ¤ minÃ¤ en muistanut", sanoi Weybridge, silminnÃ¤htÃ¤vÃ¤sti elostuen.

Nyt alkoi odotus. Minutti kului hitaasti eikÃ¤ palloa nÃ¤kynyt. Toinen
meni eikÃ¤ mikÃ¤Ã¤n sÃ¤rkenyt hiljaisten laineitten liikuntoa. Merimiehet
selittivÃ¤t toisilleen tuota kÃ¶yden kiertÃ¤misjuttua. Laivan reuna oli
tÃ¤ynnÃ¤ odottavia kasvoja. "Tule ylÃ¶s Elstead!" huusi erÃ¤s partaposkinen
merikarhu kÃ¤rsimÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤nÃ¤. Toiset yhtyivÃ¤t ja huusivat, kuin olisivat
olleet teatterissa esiripun nousua odottamassa.

Kapteeni katseli heitÃ¤ ivallisesti.

"Jos nopeuden lisÃ¤ys on kahta pienempi, niin hÃ¤n tietysti viipyy
kauvemmin", sanoi hÃ¤n. "Me emme varmaan tienneet, oliko kaava oikea. En
minÃ¤ ole mikÃ¤Ã¤n orjamainen laskennon ihailija."

Steevens yhtyi hÃ¤neen. PerÃ¤kannella ei puhuttu mitÃ¤Ã¤n muutamaan
minuttiin. Sitten kuului Steevensin kellon kuori naksahtavan.

Kun aurinko kaksikymmentÃ¤ yksi minuttia myÃ¶hemmin oli laskeutunut
taivaanrannalle, odottivat he yhÃ¤ pallon tuloa eikÃ¤ yksikÃ¤Ã¤n kannella
ollut uskaltanut kuiskatakaan, ettei toivoa enÃ¤Ã¤ ollut. Weybridge
ensimÃ¤isenÃ¤ lausui sen. Yhdentoista-lyÃ¶ntien vielÃ¤ ilmassa uidessa
sanoi hÃ¤n aivan Ã¤kkiÃ¤ Steevensille: "MinÃ¤ epÃ¤ilin aina tuota ikkunaa."

"HyvÃ¤ Jumala!" sanoi Steevens; "ettehÃ¤n Te luule --?"

"KyllÃ¤!" sanoi Weybridge ja jÃ¤tti loput hÃ¤nen mielikuvituksensa
tÃ¤ydennettÃ¤vÃ¤ksi.

"En minÃ¤ ole mikÃ¤Ã¤n erinomainen laskujen ihailija", sanoi kapteni
epÃ¤illen, "niin etten minÃ¤ kuitenkaan ole vielÃ¤ toivoton."

PuolenyÃ¶n aikaan kanuunavene kierteli kaaressa sitÃ¤ paikkaa, johon
pallo oli uponnut ja sÃ¤hkÃ¶valon valkoinen juova hÃ¤ilÃ¤hteli, lensi ja
pysÃ¤hteli rauhattomana fosforiloisteisella vesi-aavikolla pienten
tÃ¤htien alla.

"Ellei ikkuna ole murskaantunut, on juttu viisikertaa vaikeampi", sanoi
Weybridge, "sillÃ¤ sitten on hÃ¤nen kellolaitoksensa joutunut epÃ¤kuntoon
ja hÃ¤n on nyt tuolla, viisi peninkulmaa jalkaimme alla, on siellÃ¤
elÃ¤vÃ¤nÃ¤ kylmÃ¤ssÃ¤ ja pimeÃ¤ssÃ¤, suljettuna tuohon pieneen kupla
pahaseensa; on siellÃ¤, minne ei pÃ¤ivÃ¤n sÃ¤de ole koskaan paistanut eikÃ¤
ihmisolentoa elÃ¤nyt senjÃ¤lkeen kun vedet koottiin. HÃ¤n on ilman ruokaa,
nÃ¤lkÃ¤isenÃ¤, janoisena ja peloissaan, arvaillen kuoleeko nÃ¤lkÃ¤Ã¤n vai
tukehtuuko. MikÃ¤hÃ¤n siitÃ¤ tulee. Myerin aparatti on luullakseni jo
aikoja sitten lakannut tekemÃ¤stÃ¤ tehtÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤. Miten kauvan ne
oikeastaan toimivat?"

"Taivas armahtakoon!" huudahti hÃ¤n; "miten pieniÃ¤ me olemme! Millaisia
avuttomia raukkoja! Tuolla alhaalla on peninkulmia vettÃ¤ -- yhÃ¤ vaan
vettÃ¤, ympÃ¤rillÃ¤mme laajat vesivainiot ja yllÃ¤mme pilvet. Puis!" HÃ¤n
ojensi kÃ¤tensÃ¤ ja samalla kohosi merestÃ¤ valkonen sÃ¤de pilviin pÃ¤in,
alkoi liikkua hitaammin, pysÃ¤htyi kokonaan ja nÃ¤ytti uudelta taivaalle
ilmestyneeltÃ¤ tÃ¤hdeltÃ¤. Sitten se putosi alas ja katosi tÃ¤htien
heijastuksiin ja meren fosforimaiseen sumuun.

Weybridge jÃ¤i siihen, kÃ¤si ojollaan ja suu auki. Sitten hÃ¤n sulki
suunsa, aukasi sen jÃ¤lleen ja teki kÃ¤sillÃ¤Ã¤n kÃ¤rsimÃ¤ttÃ¶miÃ¤ liikkeitÃ¤,
huusi "El-stead ohoi!" ja juoksi suoraa pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤ valonheittÃ¤jÃ¤n luo. "MinÃ¤
nÃ¤in hÃ¤net", sanoi hÃ¤n. "Tuolla oikealla puolen! HÃ¤n on vÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤nyt sÃ¤hÃ¶n
palamaan ja hÃ¤n nousi juuri vedestÃ¤. Kuljettakaa valoa. MeidÃ¤n pitÃ¤isi
nÃ¤hdÃ¤ hÃ¤net, kun hÃ¤n nousee pinnalle." Ei hÃ¤ntÃ¤ lÃ¶ydetty ennen
pÃ¤ivÃ¤nkoittoa. Silloin vasta pallo tavattiin, laitettiin nostokone
kuntoon ja yhden veneen miehistÃ¶ kiinnitti keksin palloon. Saatuaan
pallon kannelle, ruuvasivat he lasin auki ja tirkistivÃ¤t pimeÃ¤Ã¤n
sisustaan (sÃ¤hkÃ¶valokammion tarkotus nÃ¤et oli valaista vettÃ¤ pallon
ympÃ¤rillÃ¤ ja se oli aivan erillÃ¤Ã¤n isosta kammiosta).

Ilma pallon sisÃ¤llÃ¤ oli hyvin kuumaa, kummi lasinreijÃ¤n reunoilla oli
pehmennyt. Innokkaisiin kyselyihin ei kuulunut vastausta eikÃ¤
liikahdustakaan elÃ¤vÃ¤stÃ¤ olennosta. Elstead nÃ¤ytti makaavan
liikkumatta, mykkyrÃ¤ssÃ¤ pallon pohjalla. Laivan lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤ri ryÃ¶mi sisÃ¤Ã¤n ja
nosti hÃ¤net ulos. Hetkeen eivÃ¤t he tienneet, oliko Elstead kuollut vai
elÃ¤vÃ¤. Laivan lamppujen keltaisessa valossa kiilsivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen kasvonsa
hielle. He veivÃ¤t hÃ¤net omaan hyttiinsÃ¤.

Havaittiin, ettei hÃ¤n ollut kuollut. Hermosto vaan oli aivan lamassa ja
ruumis kovin kolhiintunut. Muutamia pÃ¤iviÃ¤ piti hÃ¤nen maata aivan
hiljaa. Meni viikko, ennenkuin hÃ¤n voi kertoa kokemuksiaan.

Melkein ensi sanoikseen sanoi hÃ¤n lÃ¤htevÃ¤nsÃ¤ uudelleen meren pohjaan.
Pallo vaan piti tehdÃ¤ toisenlaiseksi, niin ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n tarpeen tullen voi
katkaista kÃ¶yden. HÃ¤n oli nÃ¤hnyt ihmeitÃ¤. "Te luulitte, etten minÃ¤
tapaisi muuta kuin liejua", sanoi hÃ¤n. "Te nauroitte minun
yritykselleni ja minÃ¤ olen lÃ¶ytÃ¤nyt uuden maailman!" HÃ¤n kertoi
juttunsa katkonaisesti ja enimmÃ¤kseen vÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤stÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤, niin ettÃ¤ sitÃ¤
on mahdoton toistaa hÃ¤nen sanoillaan. Mutta seuraavanlainen on kertomus
hÃ¤nen kokemuksistaan.

Alku oli kamala. Ennenkuin kÃ¶ysi pÃ¤Ã¤si juoksemaan, oli pallo kierinyt
ympÃ¤ri. HÃ¤n oli kuin sammakko potkupallossa. HÃ¤n ei nÃ¤hnyt muuta kuin
nostokoneen ja pilvet ylÃ¤puolellaan ja joskus vilauksen laivan kannella
olevista ihmisistÃ¤. HÃ¤n ei voinut aavistaakaan, minnepÃ¤in pallo ensi
hetkessÃ¤ heilahtaisi. Ã„kkiÃ¤ havaitsee hÃ¤n olevansa kumossa, koettavansa
nousta, menevÃ¤nsÃ¤ taas kuperkeikkaa tyynyillÃ¤. MikÃ¤ muu muoto hyvÃ¤nsÃ¤
olisi sisustalle ollut mukavampi, mutta mikÃ¤Ã¤n muu muoto ei olisi
voinut kestÃ¤Ã¤ alimpain vesikerrosten kovaa painetta.

Yht'Ã¤kkiÃ¤ pallo lakkasi heilumasta; se suoristui ja hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki seisomaan
noustunaan, miten vesi ympÃ¤rillÃ¤ oli vihreÃ¤nsinistÃ¤ ja heikko valo
sikersi ylhÃ¤Ã¤ltÃ¤pÃ¤in hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kohti. Joukko pieniÃ¤ uivia esineitÃ¤ kohosi
nopeasti hÃ¤nen alapuoleltaan, kuten nÃ¤ytti, valoa kohti. HÃ¤nen siinÃ¤
katsellessaan tuli pimeÃ¤mpÃ¤Ã¤ ja pimeÃ¤mpÃ¤Ã¤, kunnes vesi ylÃ¤puolella oli
mustaa kuin sydÃ¤nyÃ¶n taivas, joskin hiukan vihertÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ ja alapuolella
sydenkarvaista. Pienet lÃ¤pinÃ¤kyvÃ¤t esineet synnyttivÃ¤t hiukan valoa ja
syÃ¶ksyivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen ohitsensa hienoina vihertÃ¤vinÃ¤ juovina.

Ja tunne siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ mentiin alaspÃ¤in! Se oli aivan samanlainen kuin
pudotessa. SillÃ¤ erotuksella vaan, ettÃ¤ sitÃ¤ kesti. On vaikea kuvailla,
millaiselta tuo jatkuva putoaminen tuntui. Silloin Elstead ainakin
katui, ettÃ¤ oli retkelle lÃ¤htenyt. HÃ¤n nÃ¤ki kaikki aivan uudessa
valossa. HÃ¤n muisti ison mustekalan, jonka sanotaan elÃ¤vÃ¤n syvillÃ¤
vesillÃ¤ ja jollaisia joskus lÃ¶ydetÃ¤Ã¤n puolisulaneina valaitten sisÃ¤stÃ¤
tai kuolleina, mÃ¤dÃ¤nneinÃ¤ ja puoleksi syÃ¶tyinÃ¤ kaloissa. Otaksutaanpa,
ettÃ¤ sellainen tarttuisi kiinni eikÃ¤ laskisi menemÃ¤Ã¤n. Ja oliko
kellolaitosta kylliksi koetettu? Mutta tahtoipa hÃ¤n palata tai ei, se
ei vaikuttanut yhtÃ¤Ã¤n mitÃ¤Ã¤n.

Viidenkymmenen sekunnin kuluttua oli kaikki ulkopuolella pimeÃ¤tÃ¤ kuin
yÃ¶, paitsi siellÃ¤, missÃ¤ hÃ¤nen pallonsa valo lÃ¤visti vettÃ¤ ja valaisi
jonkun kalan tai putoavan palasen. Ne vilahtivat niin Ã¤kkiÃ¤ ohi, ettei
hÃ¤n voinut saada selville, mitÃ¤ ne olivat. Kerran hÃ¤n luuli menevÃ¤nsÃ¤
haikalan ohi. Sitten alkoi pallo kuumentua hankautuessaan veteen. He
eivÃ¤t olleet ottaneet sitÃ¤ huomioon.

EnsimÃ¤inen seikka, jonka hÃ¤n huomasi, oli ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n hikosi. Sitten hÃ¤n
kuuli jalkainsa alla yhÃ¤ Ã¤Ã¤nekkÃ¤Ã¤mpÃ¤Ã¤ kihinÃ¤Ã¤ ja nÃ¤ki joukon pieniÃ¤
kuplia -- ne olivat hyvin pieniÃ¤ -- suihkuna syÃ¶ksyvÃ¤n ylÃ¶spÃ¤in.
HÃ¶yryÃ¤! HÃ¤n koetti lasia. Se oli kuuma. HÃ¤n sytytti pienen hehkulampun,
joka valaisi hÃ¤nen huonettaan, katsoi kelloon, joka oli tyynytetyllÃ¤
seinÃ¤llÃ¤ nappulain luona, ja nÃ¤ki olleensa matkalla kaksi minuttia.
HÃ¤nen mieleensÃ¤ johtui, ettÃ¤ ikkuna voisi murtua lÃ¤mpÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤in
Ã¤kkinÃ¤isessÃ¤ vaihteessa, sillÃ¤ hÃ¤n tiesi pohjavetten aina olevan
lÃ¤hellÃ¤ jÃ¤Ã¤tymÃ¤pistettÃ¤.

Silloin alkoi pallon lattia yht'Ã¤kkiÃ¤ ikÃ¤Ã¤nkuin painaa hÃ¤nen jalkojaan,
kuplat ulkopuolella kulkivat yhÃ¤ hitaammin ja kihinÃ¤ heikkeni. Pallo
keikahti hieman. Lasi ei ollut murtunut, mitÃ¤Ã¤n ei ollut tapahtunut ja
hÃ¤n tiesi, ettÃ¤ putoamisen vaarat ainakin olivat ohitse.

Minutin kuluttua hÃ¤n tulisi pohjaan. HÃ¤n ajatteli SteevensiÃ¤ ja
WeybridgeÃ¤ ja muita siellÃ¤ viisi peninkulmaa ylempÃ¤nÃ¤, korkeammalla
hÃ¤nen ylÃ¤puolellaan, kuin korkeimmat pilvet koskaan ovat maasta. SiellÃ¤
he kulkivat hiljalleen, tuijottivat alas ja ihmettelivÃ¤t, mitÃ¤ hÃ¤nelle
oli tapahtunut.

HÃ¤n tirkisti ikkunasta. Ei nÃ¤kynyt enÃ¤Ã¤ kuplia ja kihinÃ¤ oli lakannut.
Ulkona oli ankaran mustaa -- kaikki kuin tummaa samettia -- paitsi
missÃ¤ sÃ¤hkÃ¶valo tunkeutui autioon veteen. NiissÃ¤ paikoin nÃ¤ytti vesi
kellanviheriÃ¤ltÃ¤. Sitten ui nÃ¤kyviin kolme olentoa perÃ¤kkÃ¤in. Ei voinut
saada selville, olivatko ne pieniÃ¤ ja lÃ¤hellÃ¤ vaiko suuria ja kaukana.

NiitÃ¤ ympÃ¤rÃ¶i sinervÃ¤, hÃ¤myinen valo, kalastaja-alusten lyhtyjen valon
tapainen ja kyljillÃ¤ nÃ¤kyi laivan ikkunoita muistuttavia kirkkaita
pilkkuja. Niitten valkimoiminen nÃ¤ytti lakkaavan, kun ne tulivat hÃ¤nen
lamppunsa sÃ¤teilyyn, ja silloin hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki niitten olevan pieniÃ¤,
kummallisen muotoisia kaloja. NiillÃ¤ oli isot pÃ¤Ã¤t, suuret silmÃ¤t ja
kapenevat ruumiit pyrstÃ¶ineen. Niitten silmÃ¤t olivat suunnatut hÃ¤neen
ja nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t ne seuraavan hÃ¤ntÃ¤ alaspÃ¤in. HÃ¤n arveli valon vetÃ¤vÃ¤n
niitÃ¤ puoleensa.

Toisia samanlaisia liittyi matkaan. LÃ¤hetessÃ¤Ã¤n pohjaa hÃ¤n huomasi,
ettÃ¤ vesi muuttui vaaleaksi ja lampun valojuovassa nÃ¤kyi pieniÃ¤
pilkkuja kuten tomuhiukkasia auringonvalossa. Lyijypainot varmaankin
olivat pohjasta irroittaneet mutaa ja liejua.

Lyijypainoja kohti laskeutuessaan ympÃ¤rÃ¶i hÃ¤ntÃ¤ sakea vaaleus, jota
sÃ¤hkÃ¶valo ei saanut syvÃ¤ltÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n lÃ¤vistetyksi. Monta minuuttia kului
ennenkuin liikkeelle lÃ¤hteneet pohjakerrostumat vÃ¤hÃ¤nkin asettuivat.
Sitten voi hÃ¤n nÃ¤hdÃ¤ lamppunsa ja kaukaisen kalajoukon fosforivalossa
liejusta harmahtavaksi sameutuneen veden liikahtelevan. SiellÃ¤ tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤
vaan nÃ¤kyi toisiinsa kietoutuneita merililjaryhmiÃ¤, joiden nÃ¤lkÃ¤iset
tuntorihmat hitaasti heiluivat. Ja pÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ lepÃ¤si vesi ankaran mustana.

Kauvempana nÃ¤kyivÃ¤t jÃ¤ttilÃ¤issuuren sieniryhmÃ¤n miellyttÃ¤vÃ¤t,
lÃ¤pikuultavat rajaviivat. Pohjalla oli siellÃ¤ tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ terÃ¤vÃ¤piikkisiÃ¤
latteita mÃ¤ttÃ¤itÃ¤. HÃ¤n arveli niitÃ¤ jonkunlaiseksi merisiililajiksi.
PieniÃ¤, isosilmÃ¤isiÃ¤ tai sokeita olentoja, jotka omituisesti
muistuttivat milloin siiraa milloin hummeria, ryÃ¶mi hitaasti valojuovan
yli kadoten jÃ¤lleen pimeÃ¤Ã¤n ja jÃ¤ttÃ¤en vaon liejuun.

Sitten kÃ¤Ã¤nnÃ¤hti pyÃ¶reilevÃ¤ parvi pikkukaloja hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kohti kuten
kottaraisjoukko. Ne kulkivat hÃ¤nen ylitsensÃ¤ kuin hohtava lumipilvi ja
jÃ¤lempÃ¤nÃ¤ nÃ¤kyi palloa kohti uivan joku isompi olento.

Ensin se nÃ¤kyi vain epÃ¤selvÃ¤sti: laiskasti liikkuva ruumis, joka kaukaa
muistutti kÃ¤velevÃ¤Ã¤ ihmistÃ¤. Sitten se tuli lampun valosuihkuun. Loisto
sokaisi sen, se sulki silmÃ¤nsÃ¤. HÃ¤n katseli, jÃ¤ykkÃ¤nÃ¤ kummastuksesta.

Se oli omituinen luurankoinen elÃ¤in. Sen mustanpunainen pÃ¤Ã¤ muistutti
hiukan kameleonttia, mutta sillÃ¤ oli niin korkea otsa ja niin iso
aivokoppa, ettei millÃ¤Ã¤n matelijalla ole sellaista. Kasvojen pysty
asento teki sen kummallisesti ihmisolennon nÃ¤kÃ¶iseksi.

Kuopistaan ulkonevat, isot ja kameleonttimaiset silmÃ¤t sillÃ¤ oli ja
leveÃ¤ matelijan suu. Huulet olivat luiset, niitten ylÃ¤puolella pienet
sieraimet. Korvien sijalla oli kaksi kiduskantta, joitten alta tunki
esiin ohkainen korallikukka, joka eniten muistutti nuorten rauskujen ja
haikalain kukkamaisia kiduksia.

Kasvojen ihmismuotoisuus ei ollut ihmeellisintÃ¤ tÃ¤ssÃ¤ olennossa. Se oli
kaksijalkainen; sen melkein pallomaista ruumista tuki kaksi
sammakkomaista jalkaa ja paksu hÃ¤ntÃ¤. Etujaloissaan, jotka olivat vielÃ¤
pahempia ihmiskÃ¤den irvikuvia kuin sammakon, oli sillÃ¤ kuparilla
koristettu luinen sauva. VÃ¤riltÃ¤Ã¤n oli olento kirjava; sen, pÃ¤Ã¤, kÃ¤det
ja jalat olivat tulipunaset, mutta ruumiin nahkapeite, joka riippui
laskoksissa kuin vaatteet, oli harmaan valkimoiva. Nyt se oli
paikoillaan valon hÃ¤ikÃ¤isemÃ¤nÃ¤.

Vihdoin tuo syvyyden tuntematon asujain rÃ¤pÃ¤ytti silmÃ¤nsÃ¤ auki.
Varjostaen niitÃ¤ kÃ¤dellÃ¤Ã¤n avasi se suunsa ja huusi. IhmisÃ¤Ã¤ni olisi
ehkÃ¤ kuulunut samanlaiselta terÃ¤ksen ja tyynyjen lÃ¤pi. MitenkÃ¤ ilman
keuhkoja voi saada Ã¤Ã¤nen syntymÃ¤Ã¤n, sitÃ¤ ei Elstead yrittÃ¤nytkÃ¤Ã¤n
selittÃ¤Ã¤. Sitten olento siirtyi valojuovaa ympÃ¤rÃ¶ivÃ¤Ã¤n salaperÃ¤iseen
pimeyteen ja Elstead paremmin tunsi kuin nÃ¤ki, ettÃ¤ se lÃ¤hestyi palloa.
Luullen ettÃ¤ valo oli sen houkutellut luokseen, vÃ¤Ã¤nsi Elstead
sÃ¤hkÃ¶nappulaa. Hetkisen kuluttua tuntui jokin pehmeÃ¤sti koskevan
palloon. Se heilui.

Sitten huuto toistui ja hÃ¤nestÃ¤ tuntui, kuin kaukainen kaiku siihen
vastaisi. Kosketus uudistui; pallo heilahti ja kopahti rullaan, jolle
kÃ¶ysi oli kierretty. HÃ¤n seisoi pimeÃ¤ssÃ¤ ja tirkisti syvyyden
ijankaikkiseen yÃ¶hÃ¶n. Sitten hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki, hyvin hÃ¤mÃ¤rinÃ¤ ja kaukana,
useita fosforiloistoisia ihmismÃ¤isiÃ¤ olioita. Ne tulivat hyvÃ¤Ã¤ vauhtia
hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kohti.

PuolipyÃ¶rryksissÃ¤ etsi hÃ¤n heiluvassa vankilassaan ulkopuolisen
sÃ¤hkÃ¶lampun nappulaa ja sytytti epÃ¤huomiossa pienen hehkulamppunsa
seinÃ¤tyynyjen vÃ¤lissÃ¤. Pallo pyÃ¶ri ja lÃ¤hti alaspÃ¤in. HÃ¤n kuuli
hÃ¤mmÃ¤styksen huudahduksia ja nÃ¤ki jaloilleen pÃ¤Ã¤styÃ¤Ã¤n alaikkunassaan
kaksi muljottavaa silmÃ¤paria, joihin hÃ¤nen lamppunsa valo kuvastui.

Samassa hetkessÃ¤ iskivÃ¤t ankarat kourat pallon terÃ¤speitteeseen ja
kellon metallisuojustasta, jota taottiin voimain takaa, lÃ¤hti perin
ikÃ¤vÃ¤ Ã¤Ã¤ni. Elstead oli sydÃ¤n kurkussa, sillÃ¤ jos nuo olennot
pysÃ¤yttÃ¤isivÃ¤t kellolaitoksen, ei hÃ¤nellÃ¤ olisi ylÃ¶spÃ¤Ã¤syn toivoakaan.
Tuskin oli hÃ¤n sen saanut ajatelluksi, kun pallo heilui ankarasti ja
hÃ¤nen jalkansa tÃ¤rÃ¤htivÃ¤t sen pohjaa vastaan. HÃ¤n sammutti pikku-lampun
ja sytytti ylÃ¤osastossa olevan ison lampun, jonka valo heittyi ulos
veteen. Merenpohja ja ihmismuotoiset olennot olivat poissa ja joukko
toisiaan takaa-ajavia kaloja kulki ikkunan ohi.

HÃ¤n luuli noitten syvyyden kummallisten asujain katkaisseen hÃ¤nen
kÃ¶ytensÃ¤. HÃ¤n oli kai pelastunut. Nopeammin ja nopeammin kulki hÃ¤n
ylÃ¶spÃ¤in. Sitten pallo pysÃ¤htyi. Ã„kkinÃ¤inen nykÃ¤ys ja hÃ¤nen pÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤ iski
vankilan kattoon. Puoleen minuuttiin ei hÃ¤n voinut ajatella mitÃ¤Ã¤n.

Sitten hÃ¤n tunsi, miten pallo pyÃ¶ri ja keinui hitaasti. Samalla tuntui,
kuin olisi sitÃ¤ vedetty pitkin merta. Nojaten ikkunaan sai hÃ¤n sen
puolen palloa painumaan alaspÃ¤in, mutta muuta ei nÃ¤kynyt kuin hÃ¤nen
lamppunsa valojuova, joka turhaan ponnisteli pimeyttÃ¤ vastaan. HÃ¤nen
mieleensÃ¤ juolahti, ettÃ¤ voisi ehkÃ¤ nÃ¤hdÃ¤ paremmin, jos sammuttaisi
valon ja antaisi silmÃ¤in tottua syvÃ¤Ã¤n pimeyteen.

SiinÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli oikeassa. Hetkisen kuluttua muuttui tuo samettimainen
pimeys lÃ¤pikuultavaksi ja hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki kaukana ja niin heikosti kuin
Englannin kesÃ¤n hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤valossa alapuolellaan liikkuvia olentoja. HÃ¤n
pÃ¤Ã¤tti, ettÃ¤ nuo elÃ¤imet olivat irroittaneet hÃ¤nen kÃ¶ytensÃ¤ ja
kuljettivat hÃ¤ntÃ¤ pitkin meren pohjaa.

Ja sitten hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki vÃ¤reilevÃ¤n meren alaisen tason lÃ¤pi jotakin
epÃ¤selvÃ¤Ã¤ ja kaukaista: niin laajalle, kuin pienestÃ¤ ikkunasta voi
nÃ¤hdÃ¤, levisi nÃ¤kÃ¶piiri kuulakan valoisena. Sinne pÃ¤in hÃ¤ntÃ¤
kuletettiin, aivan kuin ihmiset olisivat kulettaneet ilmapalloa maalta
kaupunkiin. Matka kÃ¤vi kovin hitaasti ja kovin hitaasti jÃ¤rjestyi
valoisa ala selvempiin muotoihin.

Kello oli pian viisi, kun hÃ¤n saapui tuon valoisan paikan kohdalle.

Nyt hÃ¤n voi nÃ¤hdÃ¤ muotoja, jotka muistuttivat katuja taloineen. Ne
olivat ryhmÃ¤ssÃ¤ suuren, katottoman rakennuksen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤, joka
omituisesti muistutti luostarin raunioita. Kaikki oli kuin kartalla
hÃ¤nen allaan. Talot olivat katottomia seinÃ¤ryhmiÃ¤. Ne olivat, kuten hÃ¤n
myÃ¶hemmin huomasi, valkimoivaa luuta. Kaikki nÃ¤ytti veteen vajonneesta
kuuvalosta tehdyltÃ¤.

Paikan keskustassa ojentelivat heiluvat liljatÃ¤hdet tuntorihmojaan,
korkeat, hoikat ja lasimaiset sienet kohosivat kuin kirkkaat tornit ja
liljain hehkuva valo erosi paikan yleisvalaistuksesta. Avoimilla
paikoilla voi hÃ¤n nÃ¤hdÃ¤ liikkuvia joukkoja, mutta oli liian korkealla
voidakseen eroittaa yksilÃ¶jÃ¤.

Sitten ne vetivÃ¤t hÃ¤ntÃ¤ hitaasti alaspÃ¤in. Paikan yksityiskohdat
alkoivat vÃ¤hitellen selvitÃ¤. HÃ¤n nÃ¤ki, ettÃ¤ noiden pilvimÃ¤isten
rakennusten rajaviivat olivat pieniÃ¤ pyÃ¶reitÃ¤ helmimÃ¤isiÃ¤ esineitÃ¤ ja
ettÃ¤ eri paikoissa hÃ¤nen alapuolellaan, avoimilla paikoilla, oli kuin
kuoreen peittyneitten laivain runkoja.

Hitaasti ja varmasti hÃ¤n painui alaspÃ¤in ja muodot hÃ¤nen allaan yhÃ¤
kirkastuivat, selvenivÃ¤t, tulivat mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤tymmiksi. HÃ¤n huomasi kulkevansa
kaupungin keskessÃ¤ olevaa isoa rakennusta kohti ja hÃ¤n voi nÃ¤hdÃ¤ ne
mitÃ¤ moninaisimmat oliot, jotka kuljettivat kÃ¶yttÃ¤. HÃ¤n ihmetteli
nÃ¤hdessÃ¤Ã¤n yhden laivoista, jotka muodostivat paikan korkeat
rakennukset, olevan tÃ¤ynnÃ¤ liikehtiviÃ¤ olentoja, jotka silmÃ¤ilivÃ¤t
hÃ¤ntÃ¤. Sitten suuren rakennuksen seinÃ¤t hitaasti kohosivat hÃ¤nen
ympÃ¤rilleen peittÃ¤en koko nÃ¤kymÃ¶n.

Ne seinÃ¤t olivat veden syÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤ puuta, kierrettyÃ¤ kÃ¶yttÃ¤, rautakiskoja,
kuparia ja kuolleitten ihmisten pÃ¤Ã¤kalloja. Kallot olivat sikin sokin,
mutkikkaissa kierteissÃ¤, ja ihmeellisin kÃ¤Ã¤ntein niiden jono kulki
pitkin seinÃ¤Ã¤. Niitten silmÃ¤reijistÃ¤ ja yli koko paikan vilahteli
edestakaisin hopeahohtoisia pikkukaloja.

Ã„kkiÃ¤ tÃ¤ytti hÃ¤nen korvansa matala huuto ja hÃ¤ly, joka muistutti
ankaraa torven Ã¤Ã¤ntÃ¤. Se vaikeni ja alkoi kuulua ihmeellinen laulu.
Pallo painui alaspÃ¤in, ohi korkeakaaristen ikkunain, joista suuret
joukot noita kummallisia henkimÃ¤isiÃ¤ olentoja katseli hÃ¤ntÃ¤. Vihdoin
hÃ¤n tuli, kuten nÃ¤ytti, jonkunmoiselle alttarille keskellÃ¤ kaupunkia.

Nyt oli hÃ¤n niin alhaalla, ettÃ¤ voi nÃ¤hdÃ¤ nuo kummalliset syvyyksien
elÃ¤jÃ¤t vielÃ¤kin selvemmin. Ihmeekseen hÃ¤n huomasi niitten kaikkien
kumartuvan hÃ¤nen eteensÃ¤. Yksi vain, jolla nÃ¤ytti olevan suomupuku ja
pÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤ loistava diademi, seisoi aukoen ja sulkien matelijasuutaan aivan
kuin olisi johtanut kumartuneitten laulua.

MikÃ¤ lieneekin saanut Elsteadin jÃ¤lleen sytyttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n pienen
hehkulamppunsa, vaikka oli melkein varmaa, ettÃ¤ olennot hÃ¤viÃ¤isivÃ¤t sen
nÃ¤hdessÃ¤Ã¤n pimeyteen. Valon Ã¤kkiÃ¤ syttyessÃ¤ loppui laulu ja alkoi
kuulua riemuitseva melu. Elstead peloissaan sammutti jÃ¤lleen lampun ja
katosi heiltÃ¤. Hetkeen ei hÃ¤n voinut nÃ¤hdÃ¤, mitÃ¤ olennot tekivÃ¤t, mutta
silmÃ¤in jÃ¤lleen totuttua pimeÃ¤ssÃ¤ eroittamaan hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki, ettÃ¤ ne olivat
jÃ¤lleen polvillaan. Ja niin he hÃ¤ntÃ¤ palvelivat kolme tuntia yhteen
mittaan.

MitÃ¤ seikkaperÃ¤isimmin kertoi Elstead tÃ¤stÃ¤ kummallisesta kaupungista
ja sen asujista, noista ikuisen yÃ¶n elÃ¤jistÃ¤, jotka eivÃ¤t ole koskaan
nÃ¤hneet aurinkoa, kuuta, tÃ¤hteÃ¤, viheriÃ¤istÃ¤ ruohoa, eivÃ¤tkÃ¤ yhtÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n
ilmaa hengittÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ olentoa, jotka eivÃ¤t tiedÃ¤ mitÃ¤Ã¤n tulesta eivÃ¤tkÃ¤
muusta valosta kuin elÃ¤vÃ¤in olentojen fosforiloistosta.

Jos hÃ¤nen kertomuksensa on ihmeellinen, niin vielÃ¤ kummempaa on kuulla,
ettÃ¤ niin etevÃ¤t tiedemiehet kuin Adams ja Jenkins pitÃ¤vÃ¤t sitÃ¤ aivan
uskottavana. HeidÃ¤n mielestÃ¤Ã¤n on aivan mahdollista, ettÃ¤ syvÃ¤n meren
pohjalla elÃ¤Ã¤ jÃ¤rkeviÃ¤, vettÃ¤ hengittÃ¤viÃ¤ luurankoisia elÃ¤imiÃ¤, jotka
ovat tottuneet alhaiseen lÃ¤mpÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤Ã¤n ja kovaan paineeseen ja ovat niin
raskasrakenteisia, etteivÃ¤t elÃ¤vinÃ¤ eivÃ¤tkÃ¤ kuolleina nouse pinnalle.
SiellÃ¤ ne voivat elÃ¤Ã¤ ilman ettÃ¤ meillÃ¤ on niistÃ¤ vÃ¤hintÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n tietoa,
ollen kuten mekin uuden punaisen hiekkakivikauden suurten
elÃ¤intenkaltaisten olioitten jÃ¤lkelÃ¤isiÃ¤.

Ne taas pitÃ¤vÃ¤t meitÃ¤ ihmeellisinÃ¤ meteoriolentoina, joita putoilee
heidÃ¤n salaperÃ¤isen pimeÃ¤stÃ¤ vesitaivaastaan. EmmekÃ¤ vain me itse, vaan
myÃ¶skin meidÃ¤n laivamme, metallipalaset ja tyÃ¶kalumme tulevat heille
kuin pilvistÃ¤. Joskus putoava esine musertaa jonkun heistÃ¤ aivan kuin
jonkun ylhÃ¤isen nÃ¤kymÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n voiman tuomiosta, joskus tulee harvinaisia
ja hyÃ¶dyllisiÃ¤ tavaroita, joskus tulevaisuuden ennemerkkejÃ¤. Voi ehkÃ¤
ymmÃ¤rtÃ¤Ã¤, miten he kÃ¤yttÃ¤ytyvÃ¤t nÃ¤hdessÃ¤Ã¤n elÃ¤vÃ¤n ihmisen, kun
ajattelee, mitÃ¤ joku raakalaiskansa tekisi, jos sen sekaan Ã¤kkiÃ¤
pilvistÃ¤ putoaisi loistava, sÃ¤dekehÃ¤n ympÃ¤rÃ¶imÃ¤ olio.

Tunnin tai pari kertoi Elstead Ptarmiganin upseereille yksityiskohtia
ihmeellisistÃ¤ kahdestatoista tunnistaan syvyydessÃ¤. On varmaa, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n
aikoi ne kirjoittaakin, mutta siitÃ¤ ei koskaan tullut mitÃ¤Ã¤n ja niinpÃ¤
ei meillÃ¤ ole muuta neuvoa kuin koota hÃ¤nen kertomuksensa hajanaiset
kappaleet kapteeni Simmonsin, Weybridgen, Steevensin, Lindleyn ja
muitten muistista.

Me nÃ¤emme kaikki hajanaisina kuvina -- suuren, yliluonnollisen
rakennuksen, kumartuneet, laulavat olennot tummine kameleonttipÃ¤ineen
ja heikosti loistavine vaatteineen ja Elsteadin, joka sytyttÃ¤Ã¤ jÃ¤lleen
lamppunsa ja koettaa turhaan saada niille selvÃ¤ksi, ettÃ¤ kÃ¶ysi, joka
pidÃ¤tti palloa, oli laskettava irti. Hetki hetken perÃ¤Ã¤n kului ja
Elstead kauhistui, kun kelloa katsoessaan huomasi, ettÃ¤ happea oli enÃ¤Ã¤
neljÃ¤ksi tunniksi. Mutta laulu hÃ¤nen kunniakseen jatkui; se tuntui
hÃ¤nen lÃ¤hestyvÃ¤n kuolemansa surumarssilta.

HÃ¤n ei kÃ¤sittÃ¤nyt, miten pallo oli pÃ¤Ã¤ssyt irralleen, mutta riippuvan
kÃ¶yden pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤en oli alttarin reuna hangannut siteen poikki.
Pallo pyÃ¶rÃ¤hti Ã¤kkiÃ¤ ja hÃ¤n kiisi ylÃ¶spÃ¤in, pois merenalaisesta
maailmasta kuten eeterimÃ¤inen, tyhjyyden verhooma olento, joka meidÃ¤n
ilmakehÃ¤mme lÃ¤pi liitelee omaan kotoiseen eeteriinsÃ¤. HÃ¤n katosi
palvelijoiltaan kuin vetykupla ylÃ¤ilmoja kohti. Omituinen taivaaseen
astuminen se oli niille.

YhÃ¤ suurenevalla nopeudella riensi pallo ylÃ¶spÃ¤in vapauduttuaan
lyijypainoistaan.

Ikkunapuoli oli ylimpÃ¤nÃ¤, kuplavirrat kiehuivat laseissa. Joka hetki
pelkÃ¤si hÃ¤n niitten sÃ¤rkyvÃ¤n. Sitten tuntui hÃ¤nen pÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤Ã¤n jotain
irtautuvan, se oli kuin suuri pyÃ¶rÃ¤. Huone alkoi kiertÃ¤Ã¤ ympÃ¤ri. HÃ¤n
pyÃ¶rtyi. Tajuihinsa tullessaan oli hÃ¤n hytissÃ¤Ã¤n ja kuuli tohtorin
Ã¤Ã¤nen.

TÃ¤ssÃ¤ on pÃ¤Ã¤sisÃ¤ltÃ¶ siitÃ¤ ihmeellisestÃ¤ tarinasta, jonka Elstead
katkelmina kertoi Ptarmiganin upseereille. MyÃ¶hemmin lupasi hÃ¤n sen
kirjoittaa kokonaisuudessaan. HÃ¤nen mielessÃ¤Ã¤n oli vain pallonsa
parantaminen. Se tapahtui Riossa.

Muuta kerrottavaa ei olekaan kuin se, ettÃ¤ Elstead 2 pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ helmikuuta
1896 toisen kerran laskeutui valtameren syvyyteen niiden kokemusten
opastamana, mitÃ¤ hÃ¤n ensi retkellÃ¤Ã¤n oli saanut. HÃ¤n ei palannut.
Ptarmigan risteili niillÃ¤ paikoin, missÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli mereen sukeltanut,
kolmetoista pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ lÃ¶ytÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤ hÃ¤ntÃ¤. Sitten se palasi Rioon ja tieto
hÃ¤nen kohtalostaan lÃ¤hetettiin sÃ¤hkÃ¶teitse hÃ¤nen ystÃ¤villeen. Sellainen
on nyt asiain tila. Ja onpa hyvin luultavaa, ettei uutta yritystÃ¤ enÃ¤Ã¤
tehdÃ¤ sen ihmeellisen tarinan todenperÃ¤isyyden selville saamiseksi,
jonka Elstead kertoi syvyyksien tÃ¤hÃ¤n asti tuntemattomista
kaupungeista.




Gottfried Plattnerin tarina.


On aika vaikeata mennÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n, pitÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¶ Gottfried Plattnerin tarinaa
uskoa vai eikÃ¶. Tosin meillÃ¤ on seitsemÃ¤n todistajaa -- tai tarkemmin
sanoen kuusi ja puoli silmÃ¤paria sekÃ¤ yksi eittÃ¤mÃ¤tÃ¶n tosiasia; mutta
myÃ¶skin -- mitÃ¤? -- ennakkoluuloja, terve jÃ¤rki ja mielipiteitten
jÃ¤ykkyys. SeitsemÃ¤Ã¤ kunniallisemmalta nÃ¤yttÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ todistajaa ei lÃ¶ydÃ¤
mistÃ¤Ã¤n; eittÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤mpÃ¤Ã¤ tosiasiaa kuin Gottfried Plattnerin
ruumiinrakennuksen viallisuus ei ole. EikÃ¤ koskaan ole kerrottu
pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤mpÃ¤Ã¤ juttua kuin juttu nÃ¤istÃ¤ kaikista. PÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¶mintÃ¤ jutussa on
arvoisan Gottfriedin osa (minÃ¤ luen hÃ¤net noiden seitsemÃ¤n joukkoon).
Taivas varjelkoon minua edistÃ¤mÃ¤stÃ¤ taikauskoa koettamalla olla ylen
puolueeton! MinÃ¤ tunnustan suoraan, ettÃ¤ siinÃ¤ jutussa Gottfried
Plattneriin nÃ¤hden on jotakin vinossa, mutta mikÃ¤ se vino tekijÃ¤ on,
sitÃ¤ minÃ¤ totisesti en tiedÃ¤. MinÃ¤ olen hÃ¤mmÃ¤styen nÃ¤hnyt, miten aivan
odottamattomissa auktoriteetti-paikoissakin juttu on uskottu todeksi.
Arvelen kuitenkin, arvoisa lukijani, olevan selvintÃ¤, ettÃ¤ kerron sen
ilman selityksiÃ¤.

Gottfried Plattner on nimestÃ¤Ã¤n huolimatta vapaana syntynyt
englantilainen. HÃ¤nen isÃ¤nsÃ¤, muuan elsassilainen, tuli Englantiin
kuuskymmenluvulla, nai arvokkaan ja harvinaisilla esi-isillÃ¤ varastetun
englantilaisen tytÃ¶n ja kuoli, pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤en siten onnellisen ja
tapahtumista kÃ¶yhÃ¤n elÃ¤mÃ¤nsÃ¤ (joka pÃ¤Ã¤asiassa kului parkettilattiain
tekoon) vuonna 1887. Gottfried on kahdenkymmenen seitsemÃ¤n ikÃ¤inen.
Kolme perittyÃ¤ kieltÃ¤ on auttanut hÃ¤net uusien kielten opettajaksi
pieneen yksityiskouluun EtelÃ¤-Englannissa. Ã„kkinÃ¤inen tarkastelija ei
huomaa mitÃ¤Ã¤n, mikÃ¤ eroittaisi hÃ¤net kaikista muista uusien kielten
opettajista kaikissa muissa pienissÃ¤ yksityiskouluissa. HÃ¤nen pukunsa
ei ole erittÃ¤in kallis eikÃ¤ muodikaskaan, mutta ei liioin halpa eikÃ¤
resuinen. HÃ¤nen ulkonainen olemuksensa, samoin hÃ¤nen pituutensa ja
ryhtinsÃ¤ on jotain huomaamatonta. Huomaisi ehkÃ¤, etteivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen
kasvonsa, enempÃ¤Ã¤ kuin useimpain muittenkaan ihmisten, ole aivan
tasasuhtaiset: oikea silmÃ¤ on hiukan suurempi kuin vasen ja leuan oikea
puoli vÃ¤hÃ¤n lihavampi. Jos Te tavallisen huolimattomasti avaisitte
hÃ¤nen liivinsÃ¤ ja tunnustaisitte hÃ¤nen sydÃ¤mensÃ¤ sykintÃ¤Ã¤, voisi TeistÃ¤
tuntua, ettÃ¤ sydÃ¤n on samallainen kuin kenen muun hyvÃ¤nsÃ¤. Te
pitÃ¤isitte hÃ¤nen sydÃ¤ntÃ¤Ã¤n aivan tavallisena, mutta tottunut tarkastaja
huomaisi siinÃ¤ jotain harvinaista. Kun Teille asian ilmoittaa, niin Te
kÃ¤sitÃ¤tte heti ihmeellisyyden. Gottfried Plattnerin sydÃ¤n tykyttÃ¤Ã¤
oikealla puolen ruumista.

TÃ¤mÃ¤ tosin ei ole Gottfriedin rakenteen ainoa omituisuus, mutta se
voisi ensinnÃ¤ tulla tottumattomankin huomion esineeksi. Tunnetun
kirurgin tekemÃ¤ huolellinen tutkimus Gottfriedin sisÃ¤isistÃ¤ laitoksista
nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ viittaavan siihen suuntaan, ettÃ¤ kaikki muutkin hÃ¤nen
ruumiissaan tavattavat epÃ¤suhtaisuudet ovat vÃ¤Ã¤rillÃ¤ paikoilla. Maksan
oikea nurkka on vasemmalla puolen, vasen oikealla. Keuhkot ovat
samoin vÃ¤Ã¤rin pÃ¤in. VielÃ¤ ihmeellisempÃ¤Ã¤ on, vaikka Gottfriedin
nÃ¤yttelykyvynkin ottaa lukuun, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nen oikea kÃ¤tensÃ¤ on hiljattain
muuttunut vasemmaksi. TÃ¤mÃ¤n tapauksen jÃ¤lkeen huomaamme (mahdollisimman
puolueettomastikin asiaa tarkastaen), ettÃ¤ Gottfriedin on hyvin vaikea
kirjoittaa. Se kÃ¤y pÃ¤insÃ¤ ainoastaan paperin oikeasta syrjÃ¤stÃ¤
vasempaan pÃ¤in ja vasemmalla kÃ¤dellÃ¤. Oikea kÃ¤si ei taivu heittoon,
aterioidessaan joutuu Gottfried pulaan veitsen ja kahvelin sekaantuessa
ja hÃ¤nen ajatuksensa tien suunnasta -- hÃ¤n on pyÃ¶rÃ¤ilijÃ¤ -- ovat aivan
epÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤iset. EikÃ¤ lÃ¶ydy vÃ¤hintÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n aihetta otaksua, ettÃ¤
Gottfriedissa ennen nÃ¤itÃ¤ tapahtumia olisi ollut taipumustakaan
vasenkÃ¤tisyyteen.

Toinenkin ihmeellinen tosiasia esiintyy tÃ¤ssÃ¤ hullunkurisessa
jutussa. Gottfriedilla on kolme kuvaa omasta persoonastaan. NÃ¤emme
hÃ¤net ensiksi viiden tai kuuden vuotiaana. Paksut sÃ¤Ã¤ret pistÃ¤vÃ¤t esiin
villakoltun alta hÃ¤nen siinÃ¤ seistÃ¤ murjottaessaan. TÃ¤ssÃ¤ kuvassa on
hÃ¤nen vasen silmÃ¤nsÃ¤ hiukan oikeata isompi ja leuan vasen puoli jonkun
verran lihavampi. NykyÃ¤Ã¤n ovat osat aivan pÃ¤invastoin. Kuva
neljÃ¤ntoista-ikÃ¤isestÃ¤ Grottfriedista nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ puhuvan nÃ¤itÃ¤ tosiasioita
vastaan, mutta syy on siinÃ¤, ettÃ¤ se on noita halpoja suoraan
metallille otettuja kuvia, joita siihen aikaan kÃ¤ytettiin ja jotka
kÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤vÃ¤t kuvan aivan kuin peili. Kolmas kuva esittÃ¤Ã¤ hÃ¤net
kahdenkymmenen yhden vuotiaana ja vahvistaa edellisissÃ¤ ilmenevÃ¤n
seikan. MitÃ¤ vakuuttavimmalla tavalla ilmenee tÃ¤ssÃ¤ se tosiasia, ettÃ¤
Gottfriedin molemmat puolet ovat vaihtuneet. On vain mahdottoman vaikea
arvata, miten inhimillinen olento voi nÃ¤in muuttua, ellei tapahdu
erinomaista ja samalla tyhjÃ¤npÃ¤ivÃ¤istÃ¤ ihmettÃ¤.

Voisihan nÃ¤mÃ¤ asiat tosin selittÃ¤Ã¤ siten, ettÃ¤ otaksuisi Gottfriedin
saattaneen tahallaan ihmeitÃ¤ aikaan, sydÃ¤mensÃ¤ omituisesta asemasta
lÃ¤htien. Valokuvia voi vÃ¤Ã¤rentÃ¤Ã¤ ja vasenkÃ¤tisyyttÃ¤ teeskennellÃ¤. Mutta
miehen luonne ei anna aihetta sellaisiin arveluihin. HÃ¤n on hiljainen,
kÃ¤ytÃ¤nnÃ¶llinen ja vaatimaton sekÃ¤ Nordaun kannalta lÃ¤peensÃ¤ terve. HÃ¤n
pitÃ¤Ã¤ oluesta ja tupakoi kohtuullisesti, kÃ¤velee joka pÃ¤ivÃ¤
terveydekseen ja pitÃ¤Ã¤ opetustaan laadultaan sangen arvokkaana. HÃ¤nellÃ¤
on hyvÃ¤ vaikka harjoittamaton tenoriÃ¤Ã¤ni ja hÃ¤nen ilonansa on laulaa
kansanomaisia, iloisia lauluja. HÃ¤n on ihastunut lukemiseen, joskaan ei
kuolettavasti -- suurin harha, mihin hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤sti hurskas optimisti eksyy
-- hÃ¤n nukkuu hyvin ja nÃ¤kee harvoin unia. HÃ¤n on totta tosiaan
viimeinen mies syÃ¶ttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n toisille satumaisia juttuja. EikÃ¤ hÃ¤n
suinkaan olekaan tÃ¤tÃ¤ juttua maailmalle levittÃ¤nyt, hÃ¤n on siitÃ¤ hyvin
vÃ¤hÃ¤n puhunut. HÃ¤n esiintyy tutkijalle niin voittavan vaatimattomana,
ettÃ¤ suurinkin epÃ¤ilijÃ¤ alkaa uskoa. HÃ¤n nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ kerrassaan hÃ¤peÃ¤vÃ¤n,
ettÃ¤ jotain niin tavatonta on hÃ¤nelle tapahtunut.

On surkuteltavaa, ettÃ¤ Plattner inhoo kuoleman jÃ¤lkeen toimitettua
ruumiinavausta ja tÃ¤ydellinen todistus siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nen ruumiissaan
ovat vasen ja oikea vaihtuneet, jÃ¤Ã¤ siten ehkÃ¤ ainiaaksi saamatta.
TÃ¤stÃ¤ tosiasiasta kertomuksemme uskottavuus pÃ¤Ã¤asiassa riippuu. Ei voi
mitenkÃ¤Ã¤n liikutella ihmistÃ¤ avaruudessa -- avaruus otettuna siinÃ¤
merkityksessÃ¤ kuin ihmiset yleensÃ¤ sen kÃ¤sittÃ¤vÃ¤t -- eikÃ¤ saada aikaan
hÃ¤nen eri puoliensa muuttumista. Kuinka hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kÃ¤Ã¤nnÃ¤ttekin, aina on
oikea puoli oikea ja vasen vasen. Jos esine on hyvin ohut ja litteÃ¤,
kÃ¤y se tietysti pÃ¤insÃ¤. Voihan leikata paperista kuvion, jossa on oikea
ja vasen puoli, ja vaihtaa sen sivut yksinkertaisesti kÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤mÃ¤llÃ¤ se
ylÃ¶salaisin. Mutta paksun esineen laita on toinen. Matematiset
teoretikot sanovat ettÃ¤ ainoa keino, millÃ¤ tÃ¤llaisen massivin esineen
oikean ja vasemman puolen saa vaihtumaan, on temmata tuo esine
kerrassaan pois avaruudesta sellaisena, kuin me sen tunnemme, ja
kÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤Ã¤ se jossain avaruuden ulkopuolella. TÃ¤mÃ¤ on hiukan hassua, mutta
jokainoa hiukankin matematikan teorioista tietÃ¤vÃ¤ voi sen vakuuttaa
lukijalle todeksi. Puhuaksemme teknilliseen tapaan: Plattnerin oikean
ja vasemman puolen hullunkurinen sekaantuminen todistaa, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n on
avaruudestamme siirtynyt siihen, mitÃ¤ kutsutaan neljÃ¤nneksi
ulottuvaisuudeksi ja palannut takaisin maailmaamme. Ellemme tahdo pitÃ¤Ã¤
itseÃ¤mme keksityn ja tarkoituksettoman petoksen uhreina, tÃ¤ytyy meidÃ¤n
uskoa, ettÃ¤ nÃ¤in on tapahtunut.

SiinÃ¤ ovat kouraan tuntuvat tosiasiat. Tulemme nyt niihin ilmiÃ¶ihin,
jotka yhtyivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen maailmasta poistumiseensa. Ilmenee, ettÃ¤ Plattner
opetti Sussexvillen yksityiskoulussa ei ainoastaan uusia kieliÃ¤, vaan
myÃ¶skin kemiaa, kauppamaantiedettÃ¤, kirjanpitoa, pikakirjoitusta,
piirustusta ja muutamia muita aineita, joihin poikain vanhempain
vaihtelevat pÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤npÃ¤lkÃ¤hdykset antoivat aihetta. HÃ¤n tiesi vÃ¤hÃ¤n tai ei
mitÃ¤Ã¤n nÃ¤istÃ¤ eri aineista, mutta opettajalle, joka ei istu
ylihallituksessa eikÃ¤ opeta alkeiskoulussa, ei tieto olekaan lÃ¤heskÃ¤Ã¤n
yhtÃ¤ tÃ¤rkeÃ¤ kuin luja siveellinen luonne ja ylhÃ¤inen kÃ¤ytÃ¶s. Kemiassa
hÃ¤n etenkin oli heikko. Omain sanainsa mukaan tunsi hÃ¤n ainoastaan nuo
kolme kaasua (mitÃ¤ hÃ¤n sitten lieneekin tarkoittanut). Kun oppilaat
alussa eivÃ¤t tienneet mitÃ¤Ã¤n ja johtivat koko kehityksensÃ¤ hÃ¤nestÃ¤,
joutui hÃ¤n pulaan pitkÃ¤ksi aikaa. Sitten tuli kouluun pieni
Whibble-niminen poika, jonka joku ilkeÃ¤mielinen sukulainen oli
kasvattanut mielenlaadultaan tutkivaiseksi. TÃ¤mÃ¤ poikanen seurasi
Plattnerin luentoja huomattavalla, pidÃ¤tetyllÃ¤ innolla ja toi usein,
haluten oleellisesti osoittaa intoaan, aineita Plattnerin
analyseerattaviksi. Plattner, joka oli mielissÃ¤Ã¤n siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ omasi
selvÃ¤sti elÃ¤hyttÃ¤vÃ¤n ja innostusta herÃ¤ttÃ¤vÃ¤n voiman ja samalla luotti
poikain tietÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶myyteen, analyseerasi niitÃ¤, tekipÃ¤ yleisiÃ¤ huomioita
niitten kokoonpanosta. HÃ¤n todellakin innostui siinÃ¤ mÃ¤Ã¤rin, ettÃ¤
hankki analytistÃ¤ kemiaa kÃ¤sittelevÃ¤n teoksen ja tutki sitÃ¤ vahtiessaan
poikia, jotka istuivat iltatyÃ¶ssÃ¤. HÃ¤n hÃ¤mmÃ¤styi huomatessaan kemian
kerrassaan huvittavaksi aineeksi.

TÃ¤hÃ¤n asti on kertomus aivan jokapÃ¤ivÃ¤inen. Mutta nyt astuu nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¶lle
vihertÃ¤vÃ¤ pulveri. VihertÃ¤vÃ¤n pulverin alkuperÃ¤Ã¤ lienee, paha kyllÃ¤,
mahdoton saada selville. Herra Whibble kertoo sekavan jutun, jossa
puhutaan sen lÃ¶ytÃ¤misen tapahtuneen satamassa. Vanhassa kalkkiuunissa
se oli ollut ja kÃ¤Ã¤ryssÃ¤. Olisi ollut erinomaista sekÃ¤ Plattnerille
ettÃ¤ hra Whibblen perheelle, jos siellÃ¤ ja silloin olisi pulveriin
sattunut sytytetty tulitikku. Nuori herra ei tuonut sitÃ¤ kouluun
kÃ¤Ã¤rynÃ¤, vaan tavallisessa kahdeksan unssin lÃ¤Ã¤kepullossa, jonka suu
oli tukittu revityllÃ¤ sanomalehdellÃ¤. Plattner sai sen iltapÃ¤ivÃ¤tuntien
loputtua. NeljÃ¤ poikaa oli pidÃ¤tetty rukousten jÃ¤lkeen toimittamaan
joitakin laiminlyÃ¶miÃ¤nsÃ¤ tehtÃ¤viÃ¤ ja Plattner vartioi heitÃ¤ pienessÃ¤
luokkahuoneessa, missÃ¤ kemiaa opetettiin. Ne opetusvÃ¤lineet, joita
Sussexvillen yksityiskoulussa kuten muissakin paikkakunnan pienissÃ¤
kouluissa kemian opetuksessa kÃ¤ytetÃ¤Ã¤n, ovat ankaran yksinkertaiset. Ne
ovat kootut pienelle pyÃ¶reÃ¤lle pÃ¶ydÃ¤lle nurkkaan. Tavalliseen
matkalaukkuun mahtuisi kaikki. Plattner, joka oli ikÃ¤vystynyt
toimettomaan tarkastukseensa, tuli hyvilleen Whibblen esiintyessÃ¤ ja
alkoi heti tehdÃ¤ analytisiÃ¤ kokeitaan. Whibble istui, itselleen
onneksi, turvallisen vÃ¤limatkan pÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤ katsellen Plattneria. Nuo neljÃ¤
pahantekijÃ¤Ã¤ seurasivat salaa hÃ¤nen puuhiaan mitÃ¤ innokkaimmin, ollen
muka samalla ankarasti tyÃ¶hÃ¶nsÃ¤ kiintyneinÃ¤. Kolmen kaasunkin rajoissa
oli Plattnerin kÃ¤ytÃ¤nnÃ¶llinen kemia tietysti pelottavan epÃ¤selvÃ¤.

Pojat kertovat taitavan yhtÃ¤pitÃ¤vÃ¤sti Plattnerin menettelyn. HÃ¤n kaatoi
hiukan tuota viheriÃ¤Ã¤ pulveria koeputkeen ja koetteli sitÃ¤ perÃ¤kkÃ¤in
vedellÃ¤, suolahapolla, salpietarihapolla ja rikkihapolla. Kun
minkÃ¤Ã¤nlaista tulosta ei nÃ¤kynyt, kaatoi hÃ¤n sitÃ¤ hiukan --
todellisuudessa melkein puolet pullon sisÃ¤llÃ¶stÃ¤ -- lautaselle ja
koetti tulitikkua. LÃ¤Ã¤kepullo oli hÃ¤nen vasemmassa kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n. Aine
alkoi savuta ja sulaa ja -- rÃ¤jÃ¤hti ankarasti pamahtaen ja sokaisevan
kirkkaasti loistaen.

NÃ¤hdessÃ¤Ã¤n leimauksen ja ollen valmiit onnettomuuksiin lyyhistyivÃ¤t
pojat penkkiensÃ¤ alle. KehenkÃ¤Ã¤n heistÃ¤ ei rÃ¤jÃ¤hdys sattunut ankarasti.
Pihalle pÃ¤in oleva ikkuna oli rikki ja pÃ¶ytÃ¤ kumossa. Lautanen oli
hajonnut atomeiksi. Katosta putosi rappausta. MitÃ¤Ã¤n muuta vahinkoa
eivÃ¤t koulun rakennukset ja opetusvÃ¤lineet kÃ¤rsineet. Pojat, jotka
eivÃ¤t nÃ¤hneet Plattneria, luulivat hÃ¤nen lentÃ¤neen lattialle ja
makaavan jossain pÃ¶ydÃ¤n takana nÃ¤kymÃ¤ttÃ¶missÃ¤. He hyppÃ¤sivÃ¤t
paikoiltaan hÃ¤ntÃ¤ auttamaan ja hÃ¤mmÃ¤styivÃ¤t, kun hÃ¤ntÃ¤ ei lÃ¶ytynyt
huoneesta. VielÃ¤ ankaran pamauksen pyÃ¶rryttÃ¤minÃ¤ he juoksivat avoimelle
ovelle ajatellen, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli haavoittunut ja hyÃ¶kÃ¤nnyt ulos
huoneesta. Carson, etumainen, oli tÃ¶rmÃ¤tÃ¤ ovessa yhteen rehtorin, mr.
Lidgettin kanssa.

Mr. Lidgett on lihava, hermostunut mies. HÃ¤nellÃ¤ on vain yksi silmÃ¤.
Pojat kertovat hÃ¤nen kompuroineen sisÃ¤Ã¤n mutisten niitÃ¤ miedonlaisia
kirouksia, joita hermostuneet koulumestarit totuttavat itsensÃ¤
kÃ¤yttelemÃ¤Ã¤n -- ettei pahempaa tapahtuisi. "Senkin vÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤suu!" sanoi
hÃ¤n. "MissÃ¤ on herra Plattner?" Pojat ovat yksimielisiÃ¤ siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤
sanat kuuluivat nÃ¤in. ("Koipeliini", "rÃ¤kÃ¤nenÃ¤-porsas" ja "vÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤suu"
nÃ¤yttÃ¤vÃ¤t tuoneen tavallisen, vÃ¤hÃ¤isen vaihtelun mr. Lidgettin
koulukeskusteluihin).

MissÃ¤ on herra Plattner? TÃ¤mÃ¤ kysymys toistettiin moneen kertaan
seuraavina pÃ¤ivinÃ¤. NÃ¤ytti todellakin siltÃ¤, kuin tuo hullu hyperbeli
"atomeiksi hajonnut" olisi yht'Ã¤kkiÃ¤ toteutunut. Plattnerista ei ollut
jÃ¤ljellÃ¤ nÃ¤kyvÃ¤Ã¤ osaa; ei veripilkkua, ei vaateriepua missÃ¤Ã¤n.
NÃ¤htÃ¤vÃ¤sti oli hÃ¤n vain koreasti heilahtanut pois olemassaolosta
jÃ¤lkeÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n jÃ¤ttÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤. Ei niin paljon ettÃ¤ penni peittyisi, sananlaskua
kÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ksemme. HÃ¤nen tÃ¤ydellinen katoamisensa on epÃ¤Ã¤mÃ¤tÃ¶n seuraus
tuosta rÃ¤jÃ¤hdyksestÃ¤, se on aivan varmaa.

TÃ¤ssÃ¤ ei ole tarpeen laajemmin esittÃ¤Ã¤ sitÃ¤ yleistÃ¤ mielenliikutusta,
joka Sussexvillen yksityiskoulussa, SussexvillessÃ¤ ja muualla
tapahtumaa seurasi. Onpa aivan mahdollista, ettÃ¤ joku lukijoistamme voi
mieleensÃ¤ palauttaa viime kesÃ¤n loma-aikana kuulemansa kaukaisen ja
hÃ¤ipyvÃ¤n kaijun tuosta mieliÃ¤ kuohuttavasta tapahtumasta. Lidgett
puolestaan nÃ¤ytti tekevÃ¤n kaikkensa saadakseen asian unhottumaan ja
vÃ¤hÃ¤pÃ¤tÃ¶iseksi. HÃ¤n mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤si kaksikymmentÃ¤ viisi viivaa rangaistukseksi
sille nuorukaiselle, joka jotenkaan mainitsisi Plattnerin nimen, ja
selitti luokalla, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n aivan hyvin tiesi assistenttinsa olinpaikan.
HÃ¤n selittÃ¤Ã¤ olleensa peloissaan, ettÃ¤ rÃ¤jÃ¤hdyksen tapahtumisen
mahdollisuus, huolimatta varokeinoista, joilla kemian kÃ¤ytÃ¤nnÃ¶llistÃ¤
opetusta oli vÃ¤hennetty, voisi haitallisesti vaikuttaa koulun
maineeseen. Ja samaa olisi voinut aikaansaada kaikki salaperÃ¤isyys
Plattnerin lÃ¤hdÃ¶ssÃ¤. SiksipÃ¤ hÃ¤n tekikin kaikkensa saadakseen asian
nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n niin luonnolliselta kuin mahdollista. Etenkin hÃ¤n tutki
noita viittÃ¤ silminnÃ¤kijÃ¤Ã¤, pani toimeen niin ankaran ristikuulustelun,
ettÃ¤ he alkoivat epÃ¤illÃ¤ aistiensa selviÃ¤ todistuksia. Mutta juttu
kulki, ponnistuksista huolimatta, suurenneltuna ja vÃ¤Ã¤ristettynÃ¤
yhdeksÃ¤ssÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤ssÃ¤ ympÃ¤ri maakunnan ja useat vanhemmat ottivat
poikansa pois koulusta selvillÃ¤ tekosyillÃ¤. Kaikkein vÃ¤hÃ¤pÃ¤tÃ¶isin asia
jutussa ei suinkaan ole se, ettÃ¤ suuri joukko naapurikunnan ihmisiÃ¤
nÃ¤ki tuona kiihoituksen aikana ennen Plattnerin palausta tavattoman
selviÃ¤ unia hÃ¤nestÃ¤ ja ettÃ¤ unet olivat kummallisen yhtÃ¤pitÃ¤viÃ¤.
Useimmissa niistÃ¤ nÃ¤kyi Plattner, joskus seurassa, vaeltavan
sÃ¤teilevÃ¤ssÃ¤ vÃ¤riautereessa. Kaikissa tapauksissa olivat hÃ¤nen kasvonsa
kalpeat ja murheelliset ja muutamissa liikehtivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen kÃ¤tensÃ¤
katsojaan pÃ¤in. Yksi tai pari pojista kuvitteli, nÃ¤htÃ¤vÃ¤sti painajaisen
ahdistamina, ettÃ¤ Plattner lÃ¤hestyi heitÃ¤ huomattavan nopeasti ja
nÃ¤ytti katsovan heitÃ¤ jÃ¤ykÃ¤sti silmiin. Toiset pakenivat Plattnerin
kanssa hÃ¤mÃ¤riÃ¤ ja omituisia pallomaisia olentoja. Mutta kaikki nÃ¤mÃ¤
kuvitelmat unhottuivat ja kyselyt sekÃ¤ arvelut saivat sijan, kun
Plattner palasi, toisena keskiviikkona maanantaista, jona rÃ¤jÃ¤hdys
tapahtui.

HÃ¤nen palaamisensa yhdistyi yhtÃ¤ omituisiin seikkoihin kuin
lÃ¤htÃ¶nsÃ¤kin. MikÃ¤li voi mr. Lidgettin verrattain vihaisista
pÃ¤Ã¤piirteistÃ¤ Plattnerin arkailevain tiedonantojen avulla selvÃ¤Ã¤ saada,
kÃ¤y ilmi, ettÃ¤ keskiviikkoiltana, auringon lÃ¤hetessÃ¤ laskuaan, tuo
muinainen herrasmies, jÃ¤tettyhÃ¤n iltatunnit sikseen, oli puutarhassaan
poimimassa ja syÃ¶mÃ¤ssÃ¤ mansikoita, joista hÃ¤n erinomaisesti pitÃ¤Ã¤.
Puutarha on iso ja vanhanaikuinen, uteliailta silmiltÃ¤ onneksi piilossa
korkean, muurivihreÃ¤n peittÃ¤mÃ¤n punatiiliaidan takana. Juuri
kumartuessaan tutkimaan erÃ¤stÃ¤ erinomaisen hedelmÃ¤llistÃ¤ vartta, kuuli
hÃ¤n pamauksen ja ankaran jysÃ¤hdyksen ja ennen kuin hÃ¤n ehti kÃ¤Ã¤ntyÃ¤,
tÃ¶rmÃ¤si hÃ¤neen takaapÃ¤in jokin raskas esine ankaran voimakkaasti. HÃ¤n
heilahti eteenpÃ¤in, mansikat kourassa murskaantuivat ja tÃ¶ytÃ¤ys yleensÃ¤
oli niin voimallinen, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nen silkkihattunsa -- mr. Lidgett on
rauhansuunnan puoltaja koulumiesten vaatetukseen nÃ¤hden -- tyÃ¶ntyi
Ã¤kisti otsalle, jopa toisen silmÃ¤n pÃ¤Ã¤lle. Tuo raskas heittoase, joka
hÃ¤ntÃ¤ vinosti satuttaen lÃ¤sÃ¤hti istuvaan asentoon mansikan vartten
sekaan, osoittautui kauvan sitten kadonneeksi herra Gottfried
Plattneriksemme. HÃ¤n oli erinomaisessa epÃ¤jÃ¤rjestyksessÃ¤, ilman hattua,
ilman kaulusta, paita likainen ja kÃ¤det veressÃ¤. Mr. Lidgett oli niin
vihoissaan ja hÃ¤mmÃ¤stynyt, ettÃ¤ jÃ¤i asentoonsa nelinryÃ¶min, lakki
silmÃ¤n pÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤, samalla kiivaasti vaatien Plattneria tilille epÃ¤hienosta
ja ihmeellisestÃ¤ kÃ¤yttÃ¤ytymisestÃ¤.

TÃ¤tÃ¤ tuskin idyllimÃ¤istÃ¤ nÃ¤ytelmÃ¤Ã¤ tÃ¤ydentÃ¤Ã¤ se, mitÃ¤ tahtoisin
nimittÃ¤Ã¤ Plattnerjutun ulkonaiseksi ilmaisuksi -- sen julkinen
kÃ¤sittely. On turhaa aivan seikkaperÃ¤isesti selvitellÃ¤, miten Mr.
Lidgett hÃ¤net erotti virastaan. Aivan tarkat tiedot, tÃ¤ydelliset nimet
ja osoitukset lÃ¶ytyvÃ¤t siinÃ¤ laajassa kertomuksessa, joka syntyi asiaa
kÃ¤siteltÃ¤issÃ¤ "YhdistyksessÃ¤ epÃ¤normaalien ilmiÃ¶itten selville
saamiseksi." Plattnerin oikean ja vasemman puolen omituinen vaihdos
huomattiin vasta hÃ¤nen kirjoittaessaan oikealta vasemmalle. HÃ¤n
pikemmin salasi kuin toi ilmi tÃ¤mÃ¤n omituisen vahvistavan asiainhaaran,
luullen sen vaikuttavan epÃ¤edullisesti uuden viran saantiin. SydÃ¤men
asema tuli ilmi muutamia kuukausia jÃ¤lemmin, kun hÃ¤neltÃ¤ kiskottiin
pois hammas, jonka hermot oli huumattu.

Silloin hÃ¤n hyvin vastenmielisesti suostui pikaiseen kirurgiseen
tutkintoon, jonka tuloksista piti lyhyesti tehdÃ¤ selvÃ¤Ã¤ _Anatomisessa
Aikakirjassa_. TÃ¤mÃ¤ selonteko sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ kaikki materialiset tosiasiat;
nyt me siirrymme tarkastamaan Plattnerin kertomusta asiasta.

Mutta tehkÃ¤Ã¤mme ensiksi selvÃ¤ksi ero tÃ¤mÃ¤n kertomuksen edellisen ja nyt
seuraavan osan vÃ¤lillÃ¤. Kaikki, mitÃ¤ tÃ¤hÃ¤n saakka olen kertonut on niin
ilmeisesti totta, ettÃ¤ rikoksia tutkiva lainoppinutkin sen uskoisi.
Kaikki todistajat ovat vielÃ¤ elossa. Lukija voi, jos hÃ¤nellÃ¤ on
vapaa-aikaa, kutsua pojat huomenna kokoon, tosin uhmaten pelottavaa
LidgettiÃ¤, ja ristikuulustella sanoissa solmita ja tutkistella heitÃ¤,
miten paljon mieli halajaa; Gottfried Plattnerin itse, hÃ¤nen sÃ¤rkyneen
sydÃ¤mensÃ¤ ja kolme valokuvaansa voi myÃ¶skin saada kÃ¤siinsÃ¤. Voi pitÃ¤Ã¤
toteennÃ¤ytettynÃ¤, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n rÃ¤jÃ¤hdyksen vaikutuksesta katosi yhdeksÃ¤ksi
pÃ¤ivÃ¤ksi, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n palasi verrattain kiivaasti, olosuhteitten
vallitessa, jotka luonnostaan olivat omiaan suututtamaan mr. LidgettiÃ¤,
millaisia nuo suhteet sitten lienevÃ¤tkin olleet, ja ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n palasi
kÃ¤Ã¤nnettynÃ¤ kuten heijastus palajaa peilistÃ¤. ViimeisestÃ¤
todentamastani seikasta seuraa melkoisen varmasti, ettÃ¤ Plattner noina
yhdeksÃ¤nÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ oli jossain olomuodossa meidÃ¤n avaruutemme
ulkopuolella. NÃ¤mÃ¤ todeksihavaitsemiset ovat itse asiassa paljon
varmempia kuin todistukset useata murhasta hirtettyÃ¤ vastaan. HÃ¤nen
oman kertomuksensa todenperÃ¤isyydestÃ¤ ja melkein ristiriitaisista
yksityisseikoista vastaa yksin herra Gottfried Plattner itse. MinÃ¤ en
halua kertomusta epÃ¤illÃ¤, mutta minÃ¤ tahdon huomauttaa -- seikka, jonka
monet hÃ¤mÃ¤ristÃ¤ sielullisista ilmiÃ¶istÃ¤ kertoilevat kirjailijat
jÃ¤ttÃ¤vÃ¤t tekemÃ¤ttÃ¤ -- ettÃ¤ olemme tÃ¤ten siirtymÃ¤ssÃ¤ yksinkertaisen
eittÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤stÃ¤ siihen lajiin asioita, jotka jokaisen selvÃ¤jÃ¤rkisen
ihmisen tulee joko uskoa tai olla uskomatta. EdellÃ¤ olleet huomiot
tekevÃ¤t sen mahdolliseksi; sen ristiriitaisuus kÃ¤ytÃ¤nnÃ¶llisen
kokemuksen kanssa saa sen nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n mahdottomalta. MinÃ¤ en tahdo
lukijan arvostelukyvyn valoa johtaa kumpaankaan suuntaan, kerronhan
vaan tarinan sellaisena, kuin sen Plattnerilta kuulin.

Voin mainita, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n kertoi asian minulle kotonani Chislehurstissa ja
ettÃ¤ minÃ¤ heti hÃ¤nen lÃ¤hdettyÃ¤Ã¤n menin tyÃ¶huoneeseeni ja kirjoitin
jutun niin tÃ¤ydellisesti, kuin muistin. MyÃ¶hemmin hÃ¤n hyvÃ¤ntahtoisesti
luki lÃ¤pi konekirjoitetun kappaleen, joten se oleellisesti on varmasti
oikea.

HÃ¤n kertoi rÃ¤jÃ¤hdyksen hetkellÃ¤ selvÃ¤sti luulleensa kuolevansa. HÃ¤n
tunsi kohoavansa ja tyÃ¶ntyvÃ¤nsÃ¤ -- voimallisesti taaksepÃ¤in.
Psykologille huomattava tosiseikka on, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n taaksepÃ¤in tyÃ¶ntyessÃ¤Ã¤n
selvÃ¤sti ajatteli, tÃ¶rmÃ¤isikÃ¶ hÃ¤n kemiatavarain pÃ¶ytÃ¤Ã¤n tai toisen
pÃ¶ydÃ¤n jalkaan. HÃ¤nen jalkapohjansa sattuivat lattiaan ja hÃ¤n putosi
hyvÃ¤Ã¤ vauhtia istumaan jonnekin pehmeÃ¤Ã¤n ja turvalliseen paikkaan.
TÃ¤rÃ¤ys huumasi hÃ¤net hetkiseksi. Yht'Ã¤kkiÃ¤ hÃ¤n haistoi selvÃ¤sti
palaneen tukan hajua ja tuntui siltÃ¤, kuin Lidgettin Ã¤Ã¤ni olisi
tiedustanut hÃ¤ntÃ¤. YmmÃ¤rrÃ¤tte kyllÃ¤, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nen jÃ¤rkensÃ¤ tÃ¤llÃ¤ hetkellÃ¤
oli aikalailla sekasin.

Ensiksikin hÃ¤n sai sen selvÃ¤n vaikutelman ettÃ¤ oli vielÃ¤
luokkahuoneessa. HÃ¤n tajusi aivan kirkkaasti poikain hÃ¤mmÃ¤styksen ja
mr. Lidgettin sisÃ¤Ã¤ntulon. TÃ¤stÃ¤ kaikesta on hÃ¤n vallan varma. HeidÃ¤n
huomautuksiaan hÃ¤n ei kuullut.

Mutta siihen arveli hÃ¤n olleen syynÃ¤ kokeen kuuloa heikentÃ¤vÃ¤n
vaikutuksen. Esineet hÃ¤nen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n nÃ¤kyivÃ¤t omituisen hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤sti ja
epÃ¤selvÃ¤sti, mutta hÃ¤nen jÃ¤rkensÃ¤ selitti asian varmasti joskin
erehdyttÃ¤vÃ¤sti siten, ettÃ¤ rÃ¤jÃ¤hdys oli synnyttÃ¤nyt suuren mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤n
mustaa savua. HÃ¤mÃ¤ryydessÃ¤ liikkuivat pojat ja Lidgett niin hiljaa ja
Ã¤Ã¤nettÃ¶minÃ¤ kuin haamut. Plattnerin kasvoja vielÃ¤ kirveli rÃ¤jÃ¤hdyksen
synnyttÃ¤mÃ¤ polttava kuumuus. HÃ¤n oli, kuten itse sanoi, "aivan
sumussa." HÃ¤nen ensimÃ¤iset todelliset ajatuksensa nÃ¤yttÃ¤vÃ¤t koskeneen
omaa personallista turvallisuuttaan. HÃ¤n arveli mahdollisesti
menettÃ¤neensÃ¤ nÃ¤Ã¶n ja kuulon. HÃ¤n koetteli huolellisesti jÃ¤seniÃ¤Ã¤n ja
kasvojaan. Sitten aistimukset selvisivÃ¤t ja hÃ¤n oli ihmeissÃ¤Ã¤n, kun ei
nÃ¤hnytkÃ¤Ã¤n vanhoja tuttuja pÃ¶ytiÃ¤ ja muita kouluhuoneen tavaroita
ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n. HÃ¤mÃ¤riÃ¤, epÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤isiÃ¤, harmaita haamuja oli vain niitten
sijalla. Sitten seurasi jotain joka sai hÃ¤net Ã¤Ã¤neen huutamaan ja
virvotti hetkiseksi hÃ¤nen puutuneita kykyjÃ¤Ã¤n. _Kaksi pojista kulki,
kÃ¤siÃ¤Ã¤n liikutellen, suoraan hÃ¤nen lÃ¤vitsensÃ¤!_ Kumpikaan ei nÃ¤kynyt
tietÃ¤vÃ¤n mitÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤nen lÃ¤snÃ¤olostaan. On vaikea kuvailla hÃ¤nen
tunteitaan. Pojat koskivat hÃ¤neen niin hiljaa kuin harva sumupilvi.

Plattnerin ensi ajatus oli nyt, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli kuollut. Vaikka hÃ¤n olikin
saanut aivan terveet kÃ¤sitykset asiasta, tuntui hÃ¤nestÃ¤ kumminkin
hiukan omituiselta lÃ¶ytÃ¤essÃ¤Ã¤n vielÃ¤ ruumiinsa ympÃ¤riltÃ¤Ã¤n. HÃ¤nen
toinen ajatuksensa sanoi, ettei hÃ¤n ollut kuollut, vaan nuo toiset,
ettÃ¤ rÃ¤jÃ¤hdys oli hÃ¤vittÃ¤nyt Sussexvillen yksityiskoulun ja jokainoan
sielun siinÃ¤ paitsi hÃ¤ntÃ¤. Mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n ei ollut oikein riittÃ¤vÃ¤
selvitys. HÃ¤n sai jÃ¤lleen hÃ¤mmÃ¤styttÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ katseltavaa.

Kaikki oli tavattoman mustaa; ensiksi nÃ¤ytti pimeys
eboniittikiiltoiselta. YlÃ¤puolella oli tumma taivas. NÃ¤kymÃ¶n ainoa
valopilkku oli erÃ¤Ã¤n pilven reunasta lÃ¤htevÃ¤ heikosti vihertÃ¤vÃ¤ hehku,
joka sai nÃ¤kymÃ¤Ã¤n sinisenÃ¤ vÃ¤rÃ¤jÃ¤vÃ¤n vuorisen taivaanrannan. TÃ¤mÃ¤ oli
ensi vaikutelma. SilmÃ¤in tottuessa pimeÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤n alkoi erottaa
epÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤isen vihreyden, joka erosi ympÃ¤rÃ¶ivÃ¤stÃ¤ yÃ¶stÃ¤. TÃ¤tÃ¤ pohjaa
vasten nÃ¤kyivÃ¤t luokkahuoneen esineet ja ihmiset fosforiloistoisina,
epÃ¤selvinÃ¤ ja kÃ¤sittÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶minÃ¤ haamuina. HÃ¤n ojensi kÃ¤tensÃ¤. Se meni
ilman vaivaa huoneen seinÃ¤n lÃ¤pi tulisijan luona.

HÃ¤n sanoo kiivaasti ponnistelleensa saadakseen huomion puoleensa. HÃ¤n
huusi LidgettiÃ¤ ja koetti tarttua poikiin heidÃ¤n edestakaisin
kulkiessaan. HÃ¤n herkesi nÃ¤istÃ¤ yrityksistÃ¤ vasta, kun rouva Lidgett,
jota hÃ¤n (apuopettajana) luonnollisesti vihasi, astui huoneeseen. HÃ¤n
sanoo, ettÃ¤ tunne maailmaan kuulumisesta saamatta olla sen osana oli
erinomaisen epÃ¤mieluinen. HÃ¤n vertasi jotenkin sattuvasti tuntemuksiaan
kissan tunteisiin, sen tarkastellessa lasin lÃ¤pi hiiren liikkeitÃ¤. Kun
hÃ¤n yritti saada selvÃ¤Ã¤ hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤stÃ¤, tutusta maailmasta ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n,
tuntui nÃ¤kymÃ¤tÃ¶n, kÃ¤siinsaamaton aitaus estÃ¤vÃ¤n yhteyttÃ¤.

Sitten hÃ¤n kÃ¤Ã¤nsi huomionsa lÃ¤himpÃ¤Ã¤n ympÃ¤ristÃ¶Ã¶nsÃ¤. LÃ¤Ã¤kepullo
pulverijÃ¤Ã¤nnÃ¶ksineen oli hÃ¤nellÃ¤ vielÃ¤ eheÃ¤nÃ¤ kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n. HÃ¤n pisti sen
taskuunsa ja alkoi tunnustella seutua. HÃ¤n oli nÃ¤htÃ¤vÃ¤sti istumassa
kallionlohkareella, jota peitti sametinpehmeÃ¤ sammal. PimeÃ¤tÃ¤ seutua
ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤n ei nÃ¤hnyt, sumunsekainen luokkahuoneen kuva painoi sen
aivan epÃ¤selvÃ¤ksi. HÃ¤n tunsi kuitenkin (ehkÃ¤ sentÃ¤hden ettÃ¤ kylmÃ¤ tuuli
puhalsi) olevansa lÃ¤hellÃ¤ jonkun vuoren huippua. SyvÃ¤ laakso tuntui
ammottavan jalkain alla. Pilven reunalla kimaltava vihreys nÃ¤ytti
laajenevan ja kirkastuvan. HÃ¤n nousi seisomaan ja hierasi silmiÃ¤Ã¤n.

HÃ¤n nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ sitten kulkeneen muutaman askeleen kukkulan rinnettÃ¤
alaspÃ¤in, kompastuneen, olleen vÃ¤hÃ¤llÃ¤ kaatua ja taas istahtaneen
terÃ¤vÃ¤lle kivilÃ¤jÃ¤lle odottamaan pÃ¤ivÃ¤nkoittoa. HÃ¤n havaitsi maailman
ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n olevan aivan vaiti. Oli yhtÃ¤ hiljaista kuin pimeÃ¤tÃ¤kin ja
vaikka kylmÃ¤ tuuli puhalsi kukkulan rinteellÃ¤ ei kuulunut ruohon
kahinaa eikÃ¤ oksain suhinaa. HÃ¤n voi siis kuulla, vaikkei nÃ¤hdÃ¤, ettÃ¤
se puoli kukkulaa, missÃ¤ hÃ¤n istui, oli kivinen ja autio. VihreÃ¤ valo
yhÃ¤ kirkastui ja samalla heikko, lÃ¤pikuultava purppura levisi
ylÃ¤puolella oleviin pilviin ja ympÃ¤rÃ¶ivÃ¤Ã¤n kallioiseen erÃ¤maahan
voimatta kuitenkaan niitten pimeyttÃ¤ hajottaa. PitÃ¤en silmÃ¤llÃ¤ sitÃ¤,
mikÃ¤ seurasi, olen taipuisa uskomaan, ettÃ¤ purppuravalo johtui
optillisesta kontrasti-ilmiÃ¶stÃ¤. Jotain sinistÃ¤ aaltoili samalla
alemman pilven kellanvihreÃ¤Ã¤n ja syvyydestÃ¤ hÃ¤nen allaan kuului kirkas
kellonÃ¤Ã¤ni. Rasittava odotus kasvoi rinnakkain valon kanssa.

On luultavaa ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n istui siinÃ¤ tunnin tai enemmÃ¤nkin, tuon omituisen
vihreÃ¤n valon yhÃ¤ kirkastuessa ja levitessÃ¤ loistoina lieskoina
keskitaivasta kohti. Sen kasvaessa tuo spektralinÃ¤ky _meidÃ¤n_
maailmastamme tuli joko suhteellisesti taikka todellisesti heikommaksi.
Mahdollisesti molemminkin tavoin, sillÃ¤ hetki nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ olleen meidÃ¤n
maallisen auringonlaskumme tienoissa. MeidÃ¤n maailmamme nÃ¤in kadotessa
kulki Plattner, astumalla muutaman askeleen kukkulanrinnettÃ¤ alaspÃ¤in,
lÃ¤pi luokkahuoneen lattian ja tunsi nyt istuvansa ilmassa keskellÃ¤
alakerran isompaa opetussalia. HÃ¤n nÃ¤ki oppilaat selvÃ¤sti, joskaan ei
niin hyvin, kuin oli nÃ¤hnyt Lidgettin. Oppilaat valmistelivat
iltalÃ¤ksyjÃ¤Ã¤n ja Plattnerilla oli ilo havaita, miten muutamat heistÃ¤
tekivÃ¤t Euklideestaan salaisia selvittelyjÃ¤, tietokokoelmia, joiden
olemassaolosta ei hÃ¤n tÃ¤hÃ¤n asti ollut mitÃ¤Ã¤n tiennyt. Kuva hÃ¤mÃ¤rtyi
hetki hetkellÃ¤, samalla kun viheriÃ¤ koitto kirkastui.

Katsahtaessaan alas laaksoon havaitsi hÃ¤n valon liukuneen syvÃ¤lle sen
kallioisia seiniÃ¤ pitkin. Rotkon syvÃ¤Ã¤ pimeyttÃ¤ yritti nyt lÃ¤vistÃ¤Ã¤
pieni viheriÃ¤ hehku, kiiltomadon loiston tapainen. Ja aivan samassa
kohosi kaukaisten basaltti-aaltoisten kukkulain yli ison hehkuvan
viheriÃ¤n taivaankappaleen reuna. Suuret kalliojoukkiot sen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤
muuttuivat surullisen autioiksi, niille loi viheriÃ¤ valo syviÃ¤ punervan
mustia varjoja. HÃ¤n sai nÃ¤kyviinsÃ¤ ison joukon pallomaisia esineitÃ¤,
jotka liitelivÃ¤t ylhÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ kuin voikukan siemenvillat. LÃ¤himmÃ¤t niistÃ¤
olivat kuilun toisella reunalla. Syvyyden kello kilisi yhÃ¤ nopeammin,
ikÃ¤Ã¤nkuin kÃ¤rsimÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤nÃ¤ ja erilaisia valovÃ¤ikkeitÃ¤ nÃ¤kyi siellÃ¤
tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤. Pojat pÃ¶ytineen olivat nyt aivan nÃ¤kymÃ¤ttÃ¶missÃ¤.

TÃ¤tÃ¤ omituista seikkaa, ettÃ¤ meidÃ¤n maailmamme hÃ¤visi toisen
universumin viheriÃ¤n auringon noustessa, vÃ¤ittÃ¤Ã¤ Plattner ehdottomasti
todeksi. YÃ¶n vallitessa tuossa toisessa maailmassa on siellÃ¤ vaikea
liikkua siksi, ettÃ¤ meidÃ¤n maailmamme nÃ¤kyy niin kirkkaana.
Arvoitukseksi jÃ¤Ã¤, miksi emme nÃ¤in ollen nÃ¤e vilaustakaan toisesta
maailmasta. Se johtuu ehkÃ¤ meidÃ¤n maailmamme verrattain paljon
kirkkaammasta valaistuksesta. Plattner kertoo, ettÃ¤ toinen maailma
puolenpÃ¤ivÃ¤n aikaan, kirkkaimmillaan, ei ole lÃ¤heskÃ¤Ã¤n niin valoisa
kuin tÃ¤mÃ¤ maailma tÃ¤ysikuun hohteessa. YÃ¶ taas on nokipimeÃ¤. Kumminkin
pitÃ¤isi toisen maailman esineitten nÃ¤kyÃ¤ pimeÃ¤ssÃ¤ huoneessa saman
sÃ¤Ã¤nnÃ¶n nojalla, jonka mukaan heikko fosforiloiste nÃ¤kyy ainoastaan
synkÃ¤ssÃ¤ pimeydessÃ¤. Plattnerin kerrottua tÃ¤mÃ¤n tarinan koetin minÃ¤
saada jotakin selvÃ¤Ã¤ tuosta toisesta maailmasta istumalla pitkÃ¤n ajan
erÃ¤Ã¤n valokuvaajan pimeÃ¤ssÃ¤ huoneessa yÃ¶llÃ¤. NÃ¤in tosin epÃ¤selvÃ¤sti
vihertÃ¤viÃ¤ rinteitÃ¤ ja kallioita, mutta minun tÃ¤ytyy sanoa, ettÃ¤ ne
todellakin olivat hyvin hÃ¤mÃ¤riÃ¤. Lukijalla voi olla parempi onni.
Plattner kertoi minulle, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n palauksensa jÃ¤lkeen on unessa nÃ¤hnyt
ja tuntenut samoiksi erinÃ¤isiÃ¤ paikkoja toisesta maailmasta, mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤
johtunee siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ nÃ¤hdyt maisemat ovat jÃ¤Ã¤neet hÃ¤nen muistiinsa.
NÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ aivan mahdolliselta, ettÃ¤ erinomaisen terÃ¤vÃ¤nÃ¤kÃ¶iset ihmiset
voivat vilaukselta nÃ¤hdÃ¤ tuon ihmeellisen, meitÃ¤ ympÃ¤rÃ¶ivÃ¤n vieraan
maailman.

TÃ¤mÃ¤ on joka tapauksessa asiasta poikkeamista. ViheriÃ¤n auringon
noustessa sukelsi syvyydestÃ¤ nÃ¤kyviin pitkÃ¤ rivi tummia rakennuksia.
Ne nÃ¤kyivÃ¤t hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤sti ja epÃ¤selvÃ¤sti. Hetken epÃ¤rÃ¶ityÃ¤Ã¤n Piattner
alkoi vaeltaa niitÃ¤ kohti, laskeutuen jyrkkÃ¤Ã¤ rinnettÃ¤ alaspÃ¤in.
Laskeutuminen oli pitkÃ¤llistÃ¤ ja vÃ¤syttÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤. Siihen vaikutti, paitsi
seinÃ¤mÃ¤n tavatonta jyrkkyyttÃ¤, se, ettÃ¤ pitkin kukkulan rinnettÃ¤ oli
irtonaisia vierinkiviÃ¤ suurin joukoin. Alaskapuamisesta johtuva hÃ¤ly --
silloin tÃ¤llÃ¶in tempasivat hÃ¤nen kenkÃ¤nsÃ¤ tulen kivistÃ¤ -- tuntui
olevan ainoa Ã¤Ã¤ni koko maailmankaikkeudessa, sillÃ¤ kellon kilinÃ¤ oli
tauonnut. PÃ¤Ã¤stessÃ¤Ã¤n lÃ¤hemmÃ¤ksi hÃ¤n huomasi ettÃ¤ muutamat
rakennuksista omituisesti muistuttivat hautoja, hautapatsaita ja
mausoleoita, paitsi siinÃ¤ suhteessa, ettÃ¤ olivat kaikki yhtÃ¤ mustia.
Hautarakennuksethan ovat yleensÃ¤ valkosia. Ja sitten hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki
suurimmasta rakennuksesta ryÃ¶mivÃ¤n ulos ison joukon kalpeita, pyÃ¶reitÃ¤,
vaaleankeltaisia olentoja. Ne hajaantuivat kuin kirkkovÃ¤ki eri suuntiin
tuolta leveÃ¤ltÃ¤ kadulta. Muutamat kulkivat sivukatuja ja tulivat
jÃ¤lleen nÃ¤kyviin kukkulan rinteellÃ¤, toiset menivÃ¤t tien varrella
oleviin mustiin rakennuksiin.

NÃ¤hdessÃ¤Ã¤n olentojen kulkevan ylÃ¶spÃ¤in, hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kohti, Piattner pysÃ¤htyi
hÃ¤mmÃ¤styneenÃ¤. Ne eivÃ¤t kÃ¤velleet, jalattomia kun olivat ja nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t
ihmispÃ¤iltÃ¤, joihin liittyi lierahteleva hÃ¤nnÃ¤llisen sammakonpojan
ruumis. Piattner oli niin ihmeissÃ¤Ã¤n niitten omituisesta ulkonÃ¤Ã¶stÃ¤,
ettei osannut oikein sÃ¤ikÃ¤htÃ¤Ã¤. YlÃ¶spÃ¤in puhaltava kylmÃ¤ tuuli kuljetti
niitÃ¤ hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kohti kuin saippuakuplia. Ja kun etumainen niistÃ¤ oli
kyllin lÃ¤hellÃ¤, niin hÃ¤n huomasi sen todellakin olevan ihmispÃ¤Ã¤n,
Tavattoman suuret silmÃ¤t sillÃ¤ tosin oli ja niin murheinen ja tuskainen
muoto, ettei Piattner ollut sen vertaista kuolevaisella kohdannut.
Kummallista oli, ettei se kÃ¤Ã¤ntynyt hÃ¤ntÃ¤ katsomaan, vaan nÃ¤ytti
pitÃ¤vÃ¤n silmÃ¤llÃ¤ ja seuraavan jotakin nÃ¤kymÃ¤tÃ¶ntÃ¤, liikkuvaa esinettÃ¤.
Hetkisen oli Piattner aivan ymmÃ¤llÃ¤, mutta sitten hÃ¤nen mieleensÃ¤
johtui, ettÃ¤ olento suurine silmineen tarkasti jotakin tapahtumaa siinÃ¤
maailmassa, josta hÃ¤n oli juuri tullut. YhÃ¤ lÃ¤hemmÃ¤ksi se tuli ja
Piattner oli liian hÃ¤mmÃ¤stynyt voidakseen huutaa. Tultuaan aivan hÃ¤neen
kiinni antoi se heikon rapisevan Ã¤Ã¤nen. Sitten se sattui hiljaa
koskettaen hÃ¤nen kasvoihinsa -- kylmÃ¤ltÃ¤ se tuntui -- ja kulki edelleen
vuoren rinnettÃ¤ ylÃ¶spÃ¤in, huippua kohti.

Plattnerin mielen tÃ¤ytti erinomaisen vankka vakaumus siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ tuo
pÃ¤Ã¤ omituisesti muistutti LidgettiÃ¤. Sitten hÃ¤n alkoi tarkastaa toisia
pÃ¤itÃ¤, jotka nyt tiheÃ¤ssÃ¤ parvessa nousivat rinnettÃ¤. YksikÃ¤Ã¤n ei
nÃ¤yttÃ¤nyt ollenkaan hÃ¤ntÃ¤ huomaavan. Pari niistÃ¤ tosin tuli aivan hÃ¤nen
kasvoilleen ja seurasi ensimÃ¤isen esimerkkiÃ¤, mutta hÃ¤n hypÃ¤hti
syrjÃ¤Ã¤n, kuin olisi saanut suonenvedon. Useimmat niistÃ¤ olivat
muodoltaan yhtÃ¤ murheellisia kuin ensimÃ¤inenkin ja yhtÃ¤ haikeasti ne
Ã¤Ã¤nnÃ¤htelivÃ¤t. Pari niistÃ¤ kyynelteli ja yhdellÃ¤, joka hitaasti kieri
ylÃ¶spÃ¤in, oli muodossaan helvetillisen raivon ilme. Muut olivat kylmiÃ¤
ja joittenkin silmistÃ¤ loisti iloinen tyytyvÃ¤isyys. Vihdoin oli yksi,
jonka onnen huumaus oli vallannut. Plattner ei muista muita
yhtÃ¤lÃ¤isyyksiÃ¤ huomanneensa nÃ¤issÃ¤ nÃ¤kemissÃ¤Ã¤n.

Kului luultavasti useita tuntia Plattnerin katsellessa, miten nuo
omituiset olennot hajaantuivat kukkuloille. Pian senjÃ¤lkeen kun niitten
kuilun pohjan tummasta rakennusryhmÃ¤stÃ¤ tuleva virta oli lakannut,
alkoi Plattner uudelleen kulkea alaspÃ¤in. Pimeys hÃ¤nen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n
kasvoi niin, ettÃ¤ oli hyvin vaikea astua. Taivas oli nyt kalpean
viheriÃ¤. HÃ¤nen ei ollut nÃ¤lkÃ¤ eikÃ¤ jano. MyÃ¶hemmin, kun nÃ¤mÃ¤ vaivat
tulivat, lÃ¶ysi hÃ¤n kuilun keskeltÃ¤ kylmÃ¤n puron ja kallion pehmeÃ¤
sammal, kun hÃ¤n siihen epÃ¤toivoisena ryhtyi, oli hyvÃ¤Ã¤ syÃ¶dÃ¤.

HÃ¤n haparoi kuilun hautojen keskessÃ¤, etsien itsetiedottomasti
jotain selvitystÃ¤ nÃ¤ihin salaperÃ¤isiin asioihin. Kauvan harhailtuaan
tuli hÃ¤n sen ison, mausoleon tapaisen rakennuksen ovelle, josta pÃ¤Ã¤t
olivat tulleet ulos. Sen sisÃ¤puolelta hÃ¤n lÃ¶ysi jonkunmoisen
basalttialttarin, jolla paloi joukko vihreitÃ¤ valoja. YlÃ¤puolella
kohoavasta tornista riippui kellonauha keskellÃ¤ huonetta. Pitkin seinÃ¤Ã¤
kulki tulikirjoitus, josta hÃ¤n ei saanut selvÃ¤Ã¤. VielÃ¤ ihmetellessÃ¤Ã¤n
nÃ¤itten kaikkien merkitystÃ¤ hÃ¤n kuuli poispÃ¤in kulkevain raskasten
askelten Ã¤Ã¤nen kadulta. HÃ¤n juoksi pimeÃ¤Ã¤n, mutta ei nÃ¤hnyt mitÃ¤Ã¤n. HÃ¤n
oli aikeissa kiskaista kellonnuorasta ja pÃ¤Ã¤tti lopuksi seurata
askeleita. Mutta juostenkaan ei hÃ¤n niitÃ¤ saavuttanut, eikÃ¤ huutaminen
hyÃ¶dyttÃ¤nyt mitÃ¤Ã¤n. Kuilu nÃ¤ytti Ã¤Ã¤rettÃ¶mÃ¤n laajalta. SiellÃ¤ oli
pimeÃ¤tÃ¤ kuin maallisen tÃ¤htitaivaan alla, kun taas sen korkeimpain
huippujen yli levisi aavemainen, vihreÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤. Alhaalla ei nyt ollut
yhtÃ¤Ã¤n pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤. Ne nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t kaikki olevan ankarassa puuhassa ylhÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤.
Katsoessaan ylÃ¶spÃ¤in hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki niitten ajelehtivan sinne tÃ¤nne, toisten
hitaasti leijaillen, toisten nopeassa lennossa. Ne muistuttivat, sanoi
hÃ¤n, "isoja lumihiuteita", olivat vaan mustia ja vaalean vihreitÃ¤.

Plattner arvelee menettÃ¤neensÃ¤ isomman osan seitsemÃ¤stÃ¤ tai kahdeksasta
pÃ¤ivÃ¤stÃ¤ seuratessaan noita varmoja, sÃ¤Ã¤nnÃ¶llisiÃ¤, saavuttamattomia
askeleita, haparoidessaan yhÃ¤ uusiin seutuihin tuossa loputtomassa
paholaisen haudassa, kiipeillessÃ¤Ã¤n ylÃ¶s ja alas armottomia kallioita,
vaeltaessaan huipuilla ja tarkastaessaan sinne tÃ¤nne liikkuvia muotoja.
Tarkkaa laskua ei hÃ¤n sano pitÃ¤neensÃ¤. Vaikka hÃ¤n pari kertaa tunsi
silmÃ¤in vartioitsevan itseÃ¤Ã¤n, ei hÃ¤n saanut sanaakaan vaihtaa elÃ¤vÃ¤n
olennon kanssa. HÃ¤n nukkui kivien keskessÃ¤ kukkulan rinteellÃ¤. Kuilussa
eivÃ¤t esineet olleet nÃ¤kyvÃ¤iset, sillÃ¤ maalliselta kannalta katsoen
oltiin syvÃ¤llÃ¤kin maan alla. Huipulta nÃ¤kyi maailma kohta, kun
maallinen pÃ¤ivÃ¤ oli alullaan. Joskus hÃ¤n oli kompuroimassa
tummanvihreÃ¤in lohkareitten keskessÃ¤ tai pysÃ¤htyi Ã¤kkijyrkÃ¤lle kuilun
partaalle, Sussexvillen puistikkojen vihreÃ¤in oksain huojuessa hÃ¤nen
ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n. Toisinaan taas tuntui kuin hÃ¤n kulkisi Sussexvillen katuja
tai tarkastelisi nÃ¤kymÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤nÃ¤ jonkun perheen yksityisasioita. Ja
sitten hÃ¤n huomasi, ettÃ¤ kuhunkin ihmisolentoon meidÃ¤n maailmassamme
kuuluu yksi noista liitelevistÃ¤ pÃ¤istÃ¤: ettÃ¤ jokaista tÃ¤mÃ¤n maailman
asukasta tarkkaa aika ajoin joku noista avuttomista ruumiittomuuksista.

MitÃ¤ ne ovat -- nuo elÃ¤mÃ¤n tarkastelijat? SitÃ¤ ei Plattner saanut
selville. Mutta kaksi niistÃ¤, jotka hÃ¤ntÃ¤ lÃ¤htivÃ¤t seuraamaan, olivat
kuin lapsuusmuisto isÃ¤stÃ¤ ja Ã¤idistÃ¤. Silloin tÃ¤llÃ¶in toisetkin kasvot
kÃ¤Ã¤ntyivÃ¤t hÃ¤neen pÃ¤in; niitten silmÃ¤t muistuttivat kuolleita ihmisiÃ¤,
jotka olivat hÃ¤ntÃ¤ johtaneet, loukanneet tai auttaneet nuoruudessa ja
miehuusvuosina. Aina kun ne Plattneriin katsoivat, valtasi hÃ¤net
omituinen vastuunalaisuuden tunne. Ã„idilleen hÃ¤n uskalsi puhua, mutta
ei saanut vastausta. Ã„iti katsoi suruisesti, vakavasti ja lempeÃ¤sti --
hiukan moittivastikin, kuten nÃ¤ytti -- hÃ¤nen silmiinsÃ¤.

HÃ¤n vain yksinkertaisesti kertoo tarinansa yrittÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤ sitÃ¤ selittÃ¤Ã¤.
Me saamme siis arvata, keitÃ¤ nuo elÃ¤mÃ¤n katselijat ovat. Ja jos heidÃ¤n
olemuksensa todellakin on kuolema, tÃ¤ytyy kysyÃ¤ miksi he niin tarkkaan
ja innokkaasti pitÃ¤vÃ¤t silmÃ¤llÃ¤ maailmaa, jonka ovat ijÃ¤ksi jÃ¤ttÃ¤neet.
Voi olla -- minusta nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ tÃ¤mÃ¤ todennÃ¤kÃ¶iseltÃ¤ -- ettÃ¤ elÃ¤mÃ¤mme
sammuttua, kun ei meillÃ¤ ole enÃ¤Ã¤ valittavana hyvÃ¤Ã¤ tai pahaa, meidÃ¤n
vielÃ¤ tÃ¤ytyy katsella, miten meistÃ¤ johtuvain syitten ja seurausten
ketju jatkuu. Jos ihmissielut elÃ¤vÃ¤t kuoleman jÃ¤lkeen, niin
inhimilliset pyrkimykset varmasti elÃ¤vÃ¤t niitten mukana. Mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤ on
minun oma arveluni nÃ¤hdyistÃ¤ asioista. Plattner ei anna mitÃ¤Ã¤n
selitystÃ¤, sillÃ¤ hÃ¤n ei pÃ¤Ã¤ssyt ollenkaan selville. On hyvÃ¤, jos lukija
selvÃ¤Ã¤n tajuaa tÃ¤mÃ¤n seikan. PÃ¤Ã¤ pyÃ¶rÃ¤llÃ¤ hÃ¤n vaelteli pÃ¤ivÃ¤n toisensa
jÃ¤lkeen tuossa ihmevaloisessa maailmassa meidÃ¤n maailmamme
ulkopuolella. Lopulta hÃ¤n jo oli vÃ¤synyt, heikko ja nÃ¤lkÃ¤inen. PÃ¤ivisin
-- nimittÃ¤in meidÃ¤n maallisen pÃ¤ivÃ¤n aikaan -- tuo vanha tuttu
henkinÃ¤yn tapainen kuva Sussexvillesta hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kiusasi ja suututti. HÃ¤n
ei nÃ¤hnyt omia jalkojaan ja silloin tÃ¤llÃ¶in joku noista tÃ¤hystelevistÃ¤
sieluista lehahti kylmÃ¤nÃ¤ vasten hÃ¤nen kasvojaan. Ja pimeÃ¤n aikaan
noitten tarkastelijain paljous ja heidÃ¤n syvÃ¤ murheensa saivat hÃ¤nen
sielunsa sanomattomasti sekaisin. HÃ¤neen hiipi palava halu pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤
jÃ¤lleen tuohon maalliseen elÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n, joka oli niin lÃ¤hellÃ¤ ja kuitenkin
niin kaukana. HÃ¤ntÃ¤ ympÃ¤rÃ¶ivÃ¤in esineitten epÃ¤maallisuus sai hÃ¤net
todellakin murheelliseen mielentilaan. HÃ¤n oli kiukuissaan kuvatessaan
omia seuralaisiaan. HÃ¤n huusi niille, ettÃ¤ lakkaisivat hÃ¤neen
tuijottelemasta, hÃ¤n haukkui niitÃ¤, koetti juosta pakoon. Ne olivat
yhtÃ¤ mykkiÃ¤ ja tarkkaavaisia. Miten hÃ¤n juoksikin epÃ¤tasaista tienoota,
aina ne olivat hÃ¤nen jÃ¤lillÃ¤Ã¤n.

YhdeksÃ¤ntenÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤, iltapuolella, Plattner kuuli noitten
nÃ¤kymÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤in askelten lÃ¤hestyvÃ¤n kaukaa rotkosta pÃ¤in. Silloin hÃ¤n oli
kulkemassa saman leveÃ¤n kukkulan yli, jolle hÃ¤n oli pudonnut
saapuessaan tuohon ihmeelliseen toiseen-maailmaansa. HÃ¤n kÃ¤Ã¤ntyi
juostakseen alas laaksoon ja oli juuri haparoiden hakemassa tietÃ¤, kun
hÃ¤net pysÃ¤ytti nÃ¤ky. Se oli tapahtuma erÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ huoneesta koulun
lÃ¤heisyydessÃ¤ olevan pikkukadun varrella. HÃ¤n tunsi nÃ¤Ã¶stÃ¤ molemmat
huoneessa olijat. Ikkunat olivat auki, verhot ylhÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ ja laskeva
aurinko paistoi suoraan sisÃ¤Ã¤n, niin ettÃ¤ huone aluksi oli aivan
kirkas. Se nÃ¤kyi kuin taikalyhtykuva mustaa maisemaa ja harmaan
viheriÃ¤Ã¤ hÃ¤mÃ¤ryyttÃ¤ vasten. Huoneessa oli sitÃ¤paitsi juuri sytytetty
kynttilÃ¤.

Vuoteessa makasi laiha mies, aavemaisen kalpeat kasvot rutistuneella
tyynyllÃ¤. HÃ¤nen kÃ¤tensÃ¤ olivat pÃ¤Ã¤n ylÃ¤puolella, lujasti
yhteenpuserrettuina. Vuoteen vieressÃ¤ olevalla pienellÃ¤ pÃ¶ydÃ¤llÃ¤ oli
muutamia lÃ¤Ã¤kepulloja, hiukan vettÃ¤ ja leipÃ¤Ã¤ ja tyhjÃ¤ lasi. Silloin
tÃ¤llÃ¶in laihan miehen huulet avautuivat lausuakseen sanan, jota ei
kuulunut. Mutta vaimo ei huomannut, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤ntÃ¤ mikÃ¤Ã¤n vaivasi, sillÃ¤
hÃ¤n oli ahkerassa tyÃ¶ssÃ¤: kantoi papereita vanhamallisesta kaapista
huoneen vastaiseen nurkkaan. Aluksi kuva todellakin oli hyvin selvÃ¤,
mutta kun viheriÃ¤ koitto sen takana yhÃ¤ kirkastui, niin se hÃ¤mÃ¤rtyi
tullen yhÃ¤ lÃ¤pikuultavammaksi.

Kun askeleet tulivat yhÃ¤ lÃ¤hemmÃ¤ksi, nuo askeleet, jotka niin kovina
kaikuvat toisessa maailmassa ja niin hiljaisina kuuluvat tÃ¤nne,
Plattner huomasi ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n ison joukon hÃ¤mÃ¤riÃ¤ kasvoja, jotka yhdessÃ¤
tirkistivÃ¤t pimeÃ¤Ã¤n ja katselivat huoneen kahta asujaa. Ei hÃ¤n ollut
koskaan ennen nÃ¤hnyt niin paljoa elÃ¤mÃ¤n tarkastelijoita. Suuri osa
katseli vaan kÃ¤rsivÃ¤Ã¤, toiset sanomattomassa tuskassa olevaa vaimoa,
joka ahnain silmin etsi mitÃ¤Ã¤n lÃ¶ytÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤. Ne kokoontuivat Plattnerin
ympÃ¤rille, tulivat hÃ¤nen eteensÃ¤, tÃ¶rmÃ¤sivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen kasvoihinsa ja
heidÃ¤n hyÃ¶dyttÃ¶mÃ¤n murheensa Ã¤Ã¤ni kaikui ilmassa. HÃ¤n nÃ¤ki selvÃ¤sti
ainoastaan silloin tÃ¤llÃ¶in. Toisin ajoin kuva vÃ¤rÃ¤hteli epÃ¤selvÃ¤nÃ¤ ja
viheriÃ¤t varjot liikahtelivat sen kÃ¤Ã¤nteissÃ¤. Huoneessa oli varmaan
hyvin hiljaista. Plattner nÃ¤ki, miten kynttilÃ¤n liekki savusi aivan
kohtisuoraan ylÃ¶spÃ¤in, mutta hÃ¤nen korvissaan kuului joka ainoa askel
kuin ukkosen jyry. Ja katselijat sitten! Kaksi niistÃ¤ oli aivan
huoneessa puuhailevan vaimon nÃ¤kÃ¶istÃ¤; toinen, joka nÃ¤htÃ¤vÃ¤sti oli
nainen, oli kalpea ja kirkaspiirteinen, nÃ¤ytti muinoin olleen kylmÃ¤ ja
kova, mutta pehminneen maalliselle ymmÃ¤rryksellemme kÃ¤sittÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n
viisauden kosketuksesta. Toinen olisi voinut olla vaimon isÃ¤. NÃ¤ytti
siltÃ¤, kuin olisivat he kumpikin katselleet jotain sydÃ¤metÃ¶ntÃ¤
konnantyÃ¶tÃ¤, jota he eivÃ¤t enÃ¤Ã¤ voineet estÃ¤Ã¤ tapahtumasta. Taampana
oli toisia, opettajia, jotka ehkÃ¤ olivat opettaneet vÃ¤Ã¤rin, ystÃ¤viÃ¤,
jotka eivÃ¤t olleet saaneet mitÃ¤Ã¤n aikaan. Ja miestÃ¤ katselemassa oli
myÃ¶skin suuri joukko, mutta ei yhtÃ¤Ã¤n vanhempain tai opettajain
tapaista. Kasvoja, jotka ehkÃ¤ ennen olivat olleet raakoja, nyt surun
ankaroiksi puhdistamia. Ja eturivissÃ¤ yhdet kasvot, tyttÃ¶mÃ¤iset, ei
vihaiset eikÃ¤ moittivat, vaan pikemmin kÃ¤rsivÃ¤t ja vÃ¤syneet, ja, kuten
Plattnerista tuntui, ratkaisua odottavat. Plattnerin kuvauskyky ei
riitÃ¤ tÃ¤tÃ¤ monimuotoista henkijoukkoa selvittÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n. Kello soi ja joukko
kokoontui. Sekunnin aikana nÃ¤ki Plattner ne kaikki. HÃ¤n luulee olleensa
tÃ¤llÃ¤ hetkellÃ¤ niin kiihotuksissaan, ettÃ¤ huomaamattaan otti taskustaan
pullon, jossa tuon viheriÃ¤n pulverin jÃ¤Ã¤nnÃ¶s oli ja piteli sitÃ¤
kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n. HÃ¤n ei muista tÃ¤tÃ¤ varmaan.

Askelten Ã¤Ã¤ni lakkasi Ã¤kkiÃ¤. HÃ¤n odotti hetkisen. Oli hiljaista. Sitten
kuului Ã¤kkiÃ¤ kellon ensi kilahdus; se puhkaisi odottamattoman
hiljaisuuden kuin ohut terÃ¤vÃ¤ veitsi. Samalla joukko hÃ¤nen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n
liehui edestakasin ja Ã¤Ã¤nekÃ¤s huuto alkoi kuulua. Vaimo ei kuullut
mitÃ¤Ã¤n; hÃ¤n poltti nyt jotakin kynttilÃ¤nliekissÃ¤. Kun kello soi toisen
kerran, muuttui kaikki hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤ksi ja jÃ¤isen kylmÃ¤ tuuli puhalsi lÃ¤pi
katselijain joukon. Ne kiertelivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n kuin parvi
kuolleita lehtiÃ¤ kevÃ¤ttuulessa ja kellon soidessa kolmannen kerran ne
heittivÃ¤t jotain vuoteeseen. Olette kuulleet valojuovasta. Tuo oli kuin
pimeysjuova ja kun Plattner jÃ¤lleen katsoi vuoteeseen, nÃ¤ki hÃ¤n mustan
kÃ¤den ja kÃ¤sivarren.

ViheriÃ¤ aurinko nousi juuri aution synkÃ¤n taivaanrannan yli ja huone
nÃ¤kyi hyvin epÃ¤selvÃ¤sti. Plattner voi nÃ¤hdÃ¤, ettÃ¤ se, mikÃ¤ vuoteessa
nÃ¤ytti valkoiselta, vÃ¤Ã¤ntelehti ja ettÃ¤ vaimo sÃ¤ikÃ¤hti katsoessaan
sinne yli olkansa.

TÃ¤hystÃ¤jÃ¤in parvi kohosi kuin viheriÃ¤ sumu tuulessa ja laskeutui
hitaasti laakson temppeliÃ¤ kohti. Silloin Plattner yhtÃ¤kkiÃ¤ tajusi,
mitÃ¤ tarkoitti tuo musta kÃ¤si, joka ojentui yli miehen ja vei uhrinsa.
HÃ¤n ei uskaltanut kÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤Ã¤ pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤Ã¤n sinne pÃ¤in. Kovasti ponnistaen
voimiaan ja sulkien silmÃ¤nsÃ¤ hÃ¤n alkoi juosta ja kulki ehkÃ¤
parikymmentÃ¤ askelta. Sitten hÃ¤nen jalkansa luiskahti liukkaalla
kivellÃ¤ ja hÃ¤n kaatui. HÃ¤n kaatui kÃ¤silleen; pullo sÃ¤rkyi ja rÃ¤jÃ¤hti
koskiessaan maahan.

Seuraavassa hetkessÃ¤ lÃ¶ysi hÃ¤n itsensÃ¤ pyÃ¶rtyneenÃ¤ ja verisenÃ¤
istumassa koulun takana, aidatulla pihamaalla vastapÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤ LidgettiÃ¤.

Kertomus Plattnerin kokemuksista on lopussa. Olen mielestÃ¤ni
menestyksellÃ¤ vastustanut tarinain kirjoittajassa olevaa luonnollista
halua tÃ¤llaisten tapausten kokoonlaittelemiseen. Olen mikÃ¤li
mahdollista kertonut asiat siinÃ¤ jÃ¤rjestyksessÃ¤, missÃ¤ Plattner ne
kertoi minulle. Olen huolellisesti karttanut kaikkia tyylin,
vaikutelman tai sanainsovinnon yrityksiÃ¤. Olisi ollut helppoa
esimerkiksi tehdÃ¤ kuolinvuode-nÃ¤ystÃ¤ salajuoni ja sekottaa siihen
Plattner. Mutta, lukuunottamatta sitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ mitÃ¤ uskottavimman tarinan
vÃ¤Ã¤rentÃ¤minen on moitittavaa, sellaisten kuluneitten taidekeinojen
kÃ¤yttÃ¶ mielestÃ¤ni ryÃ¶stÃ¤isi sen omituisen vaikutelman, jonka saa tuosta
pimeÃ¤stÃ¤ maailmasta harmaanvihreine valoineen ja sen leijailevista
elÃ¤mÃ¤n tarkastelijoista, jotka nÃ¤kymÃ¤ttÃ¶minÃ¤ ja saavuttamattomina aina
meitÃ¤ ympÃ¤rÃ¶ivÃ¤t.

On lisÃ¤ttÃ¤vÃ¤, ettÃ¤ kuolemantapaus todellakin sattui Vincentkadulla
aivan koulupihan vieressÃ¤ ja mikÃ¤li on selvinnyt, juuri Plattnerin
palaushetkellÃ¤. Vainaja oli kunnallisverojen kantaja ja
vakuutusasiamies. HÃ¤nen vaimonsa, joka oli paljon nuorempi, nai viime
kuussa herra Whymperin, elÃ¤inlÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rin Allbeedingista. Kun tÃ¤ssÃ¤
kerrottu osa tarinaa oli eri muodoissa kiertÃ¤nyt suupuheena ympÃ¤ri
Sussexvillen, antoi hÃ¤n minulle luvan mainita hÃ¤nen nimensÃ¤ sillÃ¤
ehdolla, ettÃ¤ minÃ¤ selvÃ¤sti tekisin tiettÃ¤vÃ¤ksi, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n mitÃ¤
ankarimmin vastustaa jokainoata kohtaa Plattnerin kertomuksessa hÃ¤nen
miehensÃ¤ viime hetkistÃ¤. HÃ¤n kieltÃ¤Ã¤ polttaneensa mitÃ¤Ã¤n testamenttia,
vaikkei Plattner hÃ¤ntÃ¤ sellaisesta tyÃ¶stÃ¤ syytÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n: hÃ¤nen miehensÃ¤ oli
kyllÃ¤ tehnyt testamentin heti heidÃ¤n naimisiin mentyÃ¤Ã¤n. Totta puhuen
oli Plattnerin kertomus huoneen sisustuksesta, siihen katsoen ettei hÃ¤n
ollut sitÃ¤ koskaan nÃ¤hnyt, ihmeteltÃ¤vÃ¤n tarkka.

Toistakin asiaa minun tÃ¤ytyy vÃ¤syttÃ¤vÃ¤n toistamisen uhallakin
painostaa, etten nÃ¤yttÃ¤isi suosivan naurettavan taikauskoisia
nÃ¤kÃ¶kantoja. Plattnerin poissaolo maailmastamme yhdeksÃ¤nÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ on
luullakseni todistettu. Mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤ ei todista oikeaksi hÃ¤nen
tarinaansa. On aivan mahdollista, ettÃ¤ avaruuden ulkopuolellakin voi
tapahtua hallusinatsionikohtauksia. Se ainakin pitÃ¤Ã¤ lukijan tarkasti
painaa mieleensÃ¤.




Mustan miehen kosto.


Ensi kerran joutui Pollock tekemisiin tuon porroh-miehen kanssa erÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤
rÃ¤meikkÃ¶-kylÃ¤ssÃ¤, joka sijaitsi laguunijoen varrella Turnerin niemimaan
takana. Sen seudun naiset ovat kuuluja kauneudestaan -- heissÃ¤ lÃ¶ytyy
nÃ¤et pisara europalaista verta Vasco da Gaman ja englantilaisten
orjakauppiaiden ajoilta; ja ehkÃ¤pÃ¤ porroh-miestÃ¤kin oli kiihottanut
heikko piirre kaukasialaista luonnetta. (Onpa kerrassaan omituista
ajatella, ettÃ¤ muutamilla meikÃ¤lÃ¤isistÃ¤ saattaa olla serkkuja, jotka
syÃ¶vÃ¤t ihmisiÃ¤ Sherboro-saarella tai kÃ¤yvÃ¤t ryÃ¶stÃ¶retkillÃ¤ Sofas-heimon
mukana.) Oli miten hyvÃ¤nsÃ¤, porroh-mies lÃ¤visti naisen sydÃ¤men,
ikÃ¤Ã¤nkuin hÃ¤n olisi ollut tavallinen italialainen rahvaan mies, ja oli
tekemÃ¤isillÃ¤Ã¤n samoin Pollockillekin. Mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤ torjui revolverillaan
tuon salamannopean iskun, joka oli tÃ¤hdÃ¤tty hÃ¤nen olkalihakseensa,
lennÃ¤tti rautaisen tikarin syrjÃ¤Ã¤n ja ampui miestÃ¤ kÃ¤teen.

HÃ¤n laukaisi uudelleen, mutta luoti lensi harhaan, puhkaisten majan
seinÃ¤Ã¤n satunnaisen akkuna-aukon. Porroh-mies kyyristyi oven suuhun ja
katsoi Pollockia kÃ¤sivartensa alatse. TÃ¤mÃ¤ nÃ¤ki auringon valossa
vilaukselta hÃ¤nen ylÃ¶salasin kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneet kasvonsa ja sitten
englantilainen oli yksin hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤ssÃ¤ mÃ¶kissÃ¤, jÃ¤nnityksestÃ¤ sairaana ja
vavisten. Kaikki tuo tapahtui lyhyemmÃ¤ssÃ¤ ajassa, kuin mikÃ¤ kuluu siitÃ¤
luettaessa.

Nainen oli aivan kuollut ja saatuaan sen selville Pollock astui majan
ovelle ja katseli ulos. SiellÃ¤ oli kaikki huikaisevan kirkasta.
PuolikymmentÃ¤ retkikunnan kantajaa seisoi ryhmÃ¤ssÃ¤ lÃ¤hellÃ¤ niitÃ¤
vihreitÃ¤ hÃ¶kkeleitÃ¤, joissa he majailivat; he tuijottivat hÃ¤neen
ihmetellen mitÃ¤ laukaukset mahtoivat merkitÃ¤. Miesjoukon takana nÃ¤kyi
leveÃ¤ rantakaistale mustaa, lÃ¶yhkÃ¤Ã¤vÃ¤Ã¤ mutaa, sitten kaislikkoa ja
vesiruohostoa, jotka muistuttivat vihreÃ¤tÃ¤ mattoa, ja kauimpana
lyijynharmaa vedenpinta. Joen vastaiselta rannalta hÃ¤Ã¤mÃ¶ttivÃ¤t
mangrove-puut epÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤isinÃ¤ sinertÃ¤vÃ¤n autereen lÃ¤pi. Matalamajaisesta
kylÃ¤stÃ¤, jonka aitaus kohosi juuri sokeriruokojen ylÃ¤puolelle, ei
kuulunut minkÃ¤Ã¤nlaista hÃ¤iriÃ¶n merkkiÃ¤.

Pollock astui varovaisesti ulos hÃ¶kkelistÃ¤ ja kulki jokea kohti,
katsahtaen tuon tuostakin olkansa yli. Mutta porroh-mies oli hÃ¤vinnyt.
Pollock puristi hermostuneesti revolveriansa kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n.

Muuan hÃ¤nen miehistÃ¤Ã¤n saapui hÃ¤ntÃ¤ vastaan ja viittasi pensaikkoon
majan taaksi, jonne porroh-mies oli kadonnut. Pollock tunsi kiusallisen
selvÃ¤sti, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli kÃ¤yttÃ¤ytynyt tavattoman tyhmÃ¤sti; tÃ¤mÃ¤
kÃ¤Ã¤nne katkeroitti ja suututti hÃ¤ntÃ¤. Ja pÃ¤Ã¤lle pÃ¤Ã¤tteeksi hÃ¤nen
oli kerrottava siitÃ¤ Waterhouselle -- tuolle siveelliselle,
mallikelpoiselle Waterhouselle -- joka tulisi aivan varmaan ottamaan
asian vakavalta kannalta. Pollock sadatteli sydÃ¤mensÃ¤ pohjasta
kohtaloansa, Waterhousea ja ennen kaikkea Afrikan lÃ¤nsirannikkoa. Koko
retki inhotti hÃ¤ntÃ¤ syvÃ¤sti. Ja kaiken aikaa hÃ¤nen mielessÃ¤Ã¤n
kummitteli epÃ¤luuloinen tunne, ettÃ¤ porroh-mies mahtoi olla jossakin
lÃ¤histÃ¶llÃ¤.

Tuntunee hiukan kammottavalta, ettei Ã¤skeinen murha ollut ensinkÃ¤Ã¤n
jÃ¤rkyttÃ¤nyt hÃ¤nen mieltÃ¤Ã¤n. Viimekuluneiden kolmen kuukauden aikana hÃ¤n
oli nÃ¤hnyt niin ylenmÃ¤Ã¤rin vÃ¤kivaltaisuutta, niin paljon kuolleita
naisia, poltettuja hÃ¶kkeleitÃ¤, vaalenevia luurankoja Kittam-joen
varsilla sofalaisten ratsujoukon vanavedessÃ¤, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nen aistimensa
olivat tylsistyneet. HÃ¤nen levottomuutensa johtui siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n tiesi
tÃ¤mÃ¤n olevan vain alkua vastaisiin ikÃ¤vyyksiin.

HÃ¤n sadatteli kiukkuisesti erÃ¤stÃ¤ mustaihoista, joka rohkeni tehdÃ¤
kysymyksen, ja jatkoi matkaansa oranssipuiden alle pystytettyÃ¤ telttaa
kohti, missÃ¤ Waterhouse lepÃ¤si; ja hÃ¤n oli hermostunut kuin poika, joka
astuu opettajansa eteen tilinteolle.

Waterhouse nukkui vielÃ¤ viimeisen unijuomansa uuvuttamana ja Pollock
istahti hÃ¤nen viereensÃ¤ erÃ¤Ã¤lle matka-arkulle, sytytti piippunsa ja jÃ¤i
odottamaan, ettÃ¤ toinen herÃ¤isi. HÃ¤nen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n oli hujan hajan
astioita ja aseita, jotka Waterhouse oli koonnut mendikansan
keskuudessa ja joita hÃ¤n oli asetellut uudelleen arkkuihin,
lÃ¤hetettÃ¤viksi veneissÃ¤ Sulymaan.

Ennen pitkÃ¤Ã¤ Waterhouse herÃ¤si, ojenteli tutkistellen jÃ¤seniÃ¤Ã¤n ja teki
sen johtopÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¶ksen, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli jÃ¤lleen tÃ¤ydessÃ¤ kunnossa. Pollock
toimitti hÃ¤nelle teetÃ¤. SitÃ¤ juotaessa Pollock kertoi hÃ¤nelle
iltapÃ¤ivÃ¤isen tapahtuman, kierreltyÃ¤Ã¤n sitÃ¤ ensin kuin kissa kuumaa
puuroa. Waterhouse otti asian vielÃ¤kin vakavammalta kannalta kuin mitÃ¤
Pollock oli odottanut. HÃ¤n ei ainoastaan paheksunut sitÃ¤, hÃ¤n haukkui,
hÃ¤n solvasikin.

"SinÃ¤ olet noita kirottuja hÃ¶lmÃ¶jÃ¤, joiden mielestÃ¤ mustaihoinen ei ole
mikÃ¤Ã¤n ihmisolento", hÃ¤n virkkoi. "En saa olla sairaana pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤Ã¤n,
ilman ettÃ¤ sinÃ¤ sekaannut johonkin likaiseen juttuun. Nyt sinÃ¤ olet
joutunut jo kolmannen kerran kuukauden kuluessa selkkauksiin jonkun
alkuasukkaan kanssa ja tÃ¤llÃ¤ kertaa on kysymyksessÃ¤ kosto, vielÃ¤pÃ¤
porroh-miehen kosto! Sinulle ollaan jo ennestÃ¤Ã¤nkin kyllin kiukkuisia
tuon epÃ¤jumalan tÃ¤hden, johon sinÃ¤ hÃ¶lmÃ¶ kirjoitit nimesi. Ja he ovat
kostonhaluisimpia paholaisia koko maailmassa. SinÃ¤ saatat ihmisen
hÃ¤peÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n sivistystÃ¤Ã¤n! Ja sinÃ¤ sanot lÃ¤hteneesi kunniallisesta
kodista! Jos vielÃ¤ kerran otan vaivoikseni tuollaisen kelvottoman,
typerÃ¤n tolvanan --"

"Annahan tulla vaan!" Ã¤rÃ¤hti Pollock sellaisella Ã¤Ã¤nellÃ¤, joka aina sai
Waterhousen suunniltaan; "annahan tulla!"

TÃ¤stÃ¤ Waterhouse kÃ¤vi sanattomaksi. HÃ¤n hypÃ¤hti pystyyn.

"Kuulehan nyt, Pollock", sanoi hÃ¤n, koetettuaan hillitÃ¤ itseÃ¤Ã¤n. "Sinun
on lÃ¤hdettÃ¤vÃ¤ kotiin. En vÃ¤litÃ¤ sinusta kauempaa. Sinusta on jo ollut
kyllin haittaa --"

"Ã„lÃ¤ ensinkÃ¤Ã¤n huolehdi", virkkoi Pollock, tuijottaen eteensÃ¤. "LÃ¤hden
kernaasti."

Waterhouse tyyntyi jÃ¤lleen. HÃ¤n istahti telttatuolille. "No, hyvÃ¤",
sanoi hÃ¤n. "En rakasta riitaa, Pollock, sen tiedÃ¤t, mutta onhan
vietÃ¤vÃ¤n harmillista nÃ¤hdÃ¤ aiheidensa menevÃ¤n myttyyn tuollaisen asian
tÃ¤hden. Seuraan sinua Sulymaan, jotta pÃ¤Ã¤set turvassa laivaan" -- "Se
on tarpeetonta", vastasi Pollock. "Voin lÃ¤hteÃ¤ yksinÃ¤ni. TÃ¤Ã¤ltÃ¤."

"PitkÃ¤lle et pÃ¤Ã¤se", sanoi Waterhouse. "SinÃ¤ et ymmÃ¤rrÃ¤ tÃ¤tÃ¤
porroh-asiaa."

"MistÃ¤ _minÃ¤_ saatoin tietÃ¤Ã¤, ettÃ¤ tuo nainen oli jonkun porroh-miehen
oma?" virkkoi Pollock katkeroituneena.

"SitÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli joka tapauksessa", sanoi Waterhouse, "etkÃ¤ sinÃ¤ saa
asiaa olemattomaksi. LÃ¤hteÃ¤ yksinÃ¤Ã¤n, vielÃ¤pÃ¤ mitÃ¤! Olenpa utelias
tietÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n, mitÃ¤ he tekisivÃ¤t sinulle. SinÃ¤ et nÃ¤y kÃ¤sittÃ¤vÃ¤n, ettÃ¤ tÃ¤mÃ¤
porroh-silmÃ¤nkÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤jÃ¤ hallitsee tÃ¤tÃ¤ maata, hÃ¤nellÃ¤ on vallassaan sen
lait, uskonto, hallitus, lÃ¤Ã¤kintÃ¤taito... Sellaiset ne nimittÃ¤vÃ¤t
pÃ¤Ã¤miehetkin. Inkvisitsioni ei olisi kelvannut pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n nÃ¤iden
veijarien kengÃ¤nnauhojakaan. Kenties hÃ¤n yllyttÃ¤Ã¤ kimppuumme Avajalen,
tÃ¤kÃ¤lÃ¤isen pÃ¤Ã¤miehen. Kaikeksi onneksi meidÃ¤n kantajamme ovat
mendilÃ¤isÃ¤. MeidÃ¤n on siirrettÃ¤vÃ¤ tÃ¤mÃ¤ pikku leirimme toiseen
paikkaan... Piru sinut perikÃ¶Ã¶n, Pollock! Ja luonnollisesti sinun
tÃ¤ytyi kaiken hyvÃ¤n lisÃ¤ksi vielÃ¤ ampua harhaan."

HÃ¤n mietiskeli ja hÃ¤nen ajatuksensa nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t olevan vastenmielisiÃ¤.
Hetken kuluttua hÃ¤n nousi ja otti pyssynsÃ¤. "Sinun sijassasi
pysyttelisin hiukan syrjÃ¤ssÃ¤", hÃ¤n huomautti olkansa yli, mennessÃ¤Ã¤n
ulos. "KÃ¤yn katsomaan, voinko saada siitÃ¤ jotain selville."

Pollock jÃ¤i miettivÃ¤isenÃ¤ istumaan telttaan. "Minut oli aiottu
sivistyneisiin oloihin", hÃ¤n virkkoi itsekseen katuen, tÃ¤yttÃ¤essÃ¤Ã¤n
piippuansa. "Parasta on pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ niin pian kuin mahdollista takaisin
Lontooseen tai Pariisiin."

HÃ¤nen katseensa sattui erÃ¤Ã¤seen lukittuun arkkuun, johon Waterhouse oli
kÃ¤tkenyt mendien maassa ostamansa sulattomat myrkytetyt nuolet. "Kunpa
olisin osannut tuota roistoa johonkin hengenvaaralliseen paikkaan", hÃ¤n
sanoi kiukkuisesti.

PitkÃ¤n ajan perÃ¤stÃ¤ Waterhouse saapui takaisin. HÃ¤n ei ollut ensinkÃ¤Ã¤n
halukas kertomaan, vaikka Pollock ahdisteli hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kysymyksillÃ¤.
Porroh-mies tuntui olevan huomattava jÃ¤sen tuossa salaperÃ¤isessÃ¤
yhdistyksessÃ¤. KylÃ¤ oli kÃ¤ynyt uteliaaksi, vaan ei vielÃ¤ uhkaavaksi.
Poppa-mies oli epÃ¤ilemÃ¤ttÃ¤ lÃ¤htenyt viidakkoon. HÃ¤n oli taitava
poppa-mies. "Tietysti hÃ¤nellÃ¤ on jotain mielessÃ¤Ã¤n", sanoi Waterhouse
ja vaikeni.

"Mutta mitÃ¤pÃ¤ hÃ¤n voisi tehdÃ¤?" kysyi Pollock, saamatta vastausta.

"Minun tÃ¤ytyy toimittaa sinut vapaaksi tÃ¤stÃ¤. Varmaankin he hautovat
jotain, muuten ei tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ olisi nÃ¤in rauhallista", virkkoi Waterhouse
pitkÃ¤n vaitiolon perÃ¤stÃ¤. Pollock tahtoi tietÃ¤Ã¤, mitÃ¤ se koski.
"Tanssivat pÃ¤Ã¤kallojen keskellÃ¤", sanoi Waterhouse, "ja keittÃ¤vÃ¤t
jotain lÃ¶yhkÃ¤Ã¤vÃ¤Ã¤ vaskikattilassa." Pollock halusi tarkempia
selityksiÃ¤, Waterhouse vastaili vÃ¤ltellen, Pollock kyseli kiusaten.
Lopulta Waterhouse menetti malttinsa. "MistÃ¤ perhanasta minÃ¤ sen
tiedÃ¤n?" hÃ¤n huudahti, kun Pollock kysyi kahdettakymmenettÃ¤ kertaa,
mitÃ¤ porroh-mies aikoi tehdÃ¤. "HÃ¤n yritti surmata sinut suoraa pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤
majassa. Nyt hÃ¤n luullakseni on koettava jotain mutkikkaampaa. Mutta ei
sinun tarvitse odottaa sitÃ¤ kovinkaan kauaa. En tahdo lamauttaa sinua.
Kenties kaikki onkin aivan jonnin joutavaa."

Kun he sinÃ¤ iltana istuivat nuotionsa Ã¤Ã¤ressÃ¤, koetti Pollock jÃ¤lleen
johtaa Waterhousen puhumaan porroh-miesten menettelytavoista. "Parasta
on, ettÃ¤ kÃ¤yt levolle", sanoi tÃ¤mÃ¤, huomatessaan toisen aikeet;
"lÃ¤hdemme liikkeelle varhain aamulla. SinÃ¤ tarvitset silloin kaiken
jÃ¤ntevyytesi."

"Mutta millÃ¤ tavalla hÃ¤n aikoo menetellÃ¤?"

"EnpÃ¤ tiedÃ¤. Se vÃ¤ki on perin huikentelevaista. Ne osaavat kaikenlaisia
kummallisia konsteja. Sinun on parasta kysyÃ¤ tuolta kuparikasvoiselta
Shakespeare-paholaiselta."

PimeydestÃ¤, mÃ¶kkien takaa vÃ¤lÃ¤hti leimaus, kuului kumea pamaus ja
Pollockin pÃ¤Ã¤n ohitse suhahti savikuula. Se ainakin oli selvÃ¤Ã¤ kieltÃ¤.
Mustaihoiset ja sekarotuiset, jotka istuivat tarinoiden oman nuotionsa
ympÃ¤rillÃ¤, hypÃ¤htivÃ¤t pystyyn ja joku ampui pimeyteen.

"Parasta ettÃ¤ menet johonkin majaan", sanoi Waterhouse rauhallisesti,
istuen yhÃ¤ alallaan.

Pollock nousi seisaalleen tulen Ã¤Ã¤ressÃ¤ ja veti esille revolverinsa.
Tappelua ei hÃ¤n ainakaan pelÃ¤nnyt. Mutta pimeys on ihmisen paras
sotisopa. HÃ¤n kÃ¤sitti Waterhousen ehdotuksen viisaaksi ja lÃ¤hti
telttaan, laskeutuen siellÃ¤ levolle.

VÃ¤hÃ¤n hÃ¤n sai nukuttua ja silloinkin hÃ¤ntÃ¤ hÃ¤iritsivÃ¤t unennÃ¤Ã¶t; hÃ¤n
uneksi monenlaisista seikoista, mutta pÃ¤Ã¤asiallisesti porroh-miehen
ylÃ¶salaisin kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneistÃ¤ kasvoista, kuten tÃ¤mÃ¤ oli katsonut hÃ¤neen
kÃ¤sivartensa alatse, lÃ¤htiessÃ¤Ã¤n ulos majasta. Omituista oli, ettÃ¤ tÃ¤mÃ¤
Ã¤killinen vaikutelma oli painunut Pollockin muistiin niin lujasti. Sen
lisÃ¤ksi tunsi hÃ¤n jÃ¤senissÃ¤Ã¤n kummallista kipua.

Kun he aamuhÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤ssÃ¤ sovittelivat tavaroitaan veneisiin, suhahti Ã¤kisti
vÃ¤hÃ¤inen vasama maahan Pollockin jalkojen juureen. Miehet koettivat
nÃ¤Ã¶n vuoksi tutkia viidakkoa, mutta ketÃ¤Ã¤n ei saatu kiinni.

NÃ¤iden kahden tapahtuman jÃ¤lkeen retkikunta osoittautui taipuvaiseksi
jÃ¤ttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n Pollockin yksiksensÃ¤ ja hÃ¤n taas tunsi ensi kerran elÃ¤mÃ¤ssÃ¤Ã¤n
tarvetta liittyÃ¤ mustien joukkoon. Waterhouse otti toisen ruuhen ja
Pollockin oli asettuminen toiseen, vaikka hÃ¤n osoittikin harrasta halua
pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ pakinoimaan Waterhousen kanssa. HÃ¤net jÃ¤tettiin itseksensÃ¤
ruuhen keulapuoleen ja hÃ¤nellÃ¤ oli tÃ¤ysi tyÃ¶ saada miehet -- jotka
eivÃ¤t pitÃ¤neet hÃ¤nestÃ¤ -- melomaan alusta keskellÃ¤ virtaa, sadan
kyynÃ¤rÃ¤n tai pitemmÃ¤nkin matkan pÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤ kummastakin rannasta. Sitten hÃ¤n
pakotti Shakespearen, erÃ¤Ã¤n sekarotuisen Freetownista, siirtymÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤nen
puolelleen purtta ja kertomaan hÃ¤nelle porroh-miehistÃ¤; ja huomattuaan
mahdottomaksi pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ erilleen Pollockista tÃ¤mÃ¤ tekikin sen huomattavan
vapaasti ja halukkaasti.

PÃ¤ivÃ¤ kului. Ruuhi lipui nopeasti laguunivettÃ¤ pitkin vesiviikunain,
kaatuneiden puiden, kaislikkojen ja viinipalmujen keskitse; ja
vasemmalla levisi tumma mangrove-rÃ¤meikkÃ¶, jonka takaa kuului silloin
tÃ¤llÃ¶in Atlannin kohajamista rannikkoa vastaan. Shakespeare kertoi
pehmeÃ¤llÃ¤, sotkuisella englanninkielellÃ¤Ã¤n, kuinka porroh-vÃ¤ki osasi
noitua; kuinka ihmiset surkastuivat heidÃ¤n vaikutuksestaan; kuinka he
voivat lÃ¤hettÃ¤Ã¤ unia ja paholaisia; kuinka he rÃ¤Ã¤kkÃ¤sivÃ¤t Ijibun poikia
ja tappoivat heidÃ¤t; kuinka he ryÃ¶stivÃ¤t erÃ¤Ã¤n sulymalaisen valkoisen
kauppiaan, joka oli pidellyt pahoin erÃ¤stÃ¤ heikÃ¤lÃ¤isistÃ¤ ja minkÃ¤
nÃ¤kÃ¶inen hÃ¤nen ruumiinsa oli ollut lÃ¶ydettÃ¤essÃ¤. Ja jokaisen tarinan
perÃ¤stÃ¤ Pollock sadatteli itsekseen lÃ¤hetystoimen velttoutta, kun se
salli mokomia seikkoja, ja kykenemÃ¤tÃ¶ntÃ¤ Englannin hallitusta, joka
vallitsi tÃ¤ssÃ¤ pahamaineisen pimeÃ¤ssÃ¤ Sierra LeonessÃ¤. Illalla he
saapuivat Kasi-jÃ¤rvelle ja majautuivat yÃ¶ksi erÃ¤Ã¤lle saarelle,
karkoittaen sieltÃ¤ parikymmentÃ¤ kankeata krokotiilia.

Seuraavana pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ he pÃ¤Ã¤sivÃ¤t Sulymaan ja tunsivat sieraimissaan
suolaisen merituulen tuoksun, mutta Pollockin tÃ¤ytyi odottaa siellÃ¤
viisi pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤, ennenkuin voi jatkaa matkaansa Freetowniin. Waterhouse
arveli hÃ¤nen nyt olevan verrattain turvassa ja Freetownin suojeluksen
alaisena ja erosi hÃ¤nestÃ¤, palaten retkikuntineen Gbemmaan. Ja Pollock
kohteli perin ystÃ¤vÃ¤llisesti Pereraa, Sulyman ainoata valkoihoista
kauppamiestÃ¤ -- vielÃ¤pÃ¤ niinkin ystÃ¤vÃ¤llisesti, ettÃ¤ seurasi hÃ¤ntÃ¤
kaikkialle. Perera oli muuan pienikasvuinen Portugalin juutalainen,
joka oli oleskellut Englannissa, ja englantilaisen ystÃ¤vÃ¤llisyys
miellytti hÃ¤ntÃ¤ suuresti.

Kahteen pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤n ei tapahtunut mitÃ¤Ã¤n erikoisempaa; enimmÃ¤kseen Pollock
ja Perera pelasivat viittÃ¤ lehteÃ¤ -- ainoa peli, jonka molemmat
tunsivat -- ja Pollock joutui velkaan. Sitten toisena iltana Pollock
sai ikÃ¤vÃ¤n huomautuksen sitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ porroh-mies oli saapunut Sulymaan;
terÃ¤vÃ¤ksi hiottu rautapalanen viilsi hÃ¤nen olkapÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤nsÃ¤ lihahaavan. Se
oli ammuttu etÃ¤Ã¤ltÃ¤ ja oli hÃ¤neen osuessaan jo menettÃ¤nyt melkein
kaiken voimansa. Mutta sanomansa se kertoi kyllin tuntuvasti. Kaiken
yÃ¶tÃ¤ Pollock istui revolveri kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n riippumatossa ja seuraavana
aamuna hÃ¤n uskoi osan jutustaan englantilais-portugalilaiselle.

Perera otti asian perin vakavalta kannalta. HÃ¤n tunsi sikÃ¤lÃ¤iset tavat
varsin tarkalleen. "TÃ¤mÃ¤ on mieskohtainen kysymys. Se on kostoa. Ja
tietysti teidÃ¤n poislÃ¤htÃ¶nne panee hÃ¤net kiiruhtamaan. Ei yksikÃ¤Ã¤n
alkuasukas tai sekarotuinen asetu hÃ¤nen tielleen -- ellette maksa
hyvin. Jos pÃ¤Ã¤sette Ã¤kkiarvaamatta hÃ¤nen kimppuunsa, niin voitte ampua
hÃ¤net. Mutta hÃ¤nkin voi ampua teidÃ¤t."

"Ja sitten on vielÃ¤ tuo kirottu loihtiminen", jatkoi Perera. "MinÃ¤ en
tietenkÃ¤Ã¤n usko sitÃ¤ -- taikauskoa -- mutta eipÃ¤ ole sittenkÃ¤Ã¤n hauskaa
ajatella, ettÃ¤ missÃ¤ sitÃ¤ lieneekin, niin aina on lÃ¤histÃ¶llÃ¤ joku musta
mies, joka silloin tÃ¤llÃ¶in viettÃ¤Ã¤ kuutamoisen yÃ¶n tanssimalla nuotion
ympÃ¤ri, lÃ¤hettÃ¤Ã¤kseen pahoja unia.... Onko teillÃ¤ ollut pahoja unia?"

"Onpa kyllÃ¤", virkkoi Pollock. "NÃ¤en yhtÃ¤mittaa tuon roiston ylÃ¶salasin
kÃ¤Ã¤nnetyn pÃ¤Ã¤n irvistÃ¤vÃ¤n minulle ja nÃ¤yttÃ¤vÃ¤n hampaitaan, kuten hÃ¤n
teki majassakin; ja sitten se tulee aivan lÃ¤helle minua, poistuu ja
tulee jÃ¤lleen takaisin. EihÃ¤n siinÃ¤ ole mitÃ¤Ã¤n peloittavaa, mutta
kuitenkin se jÃ¤hmetyttÃ¤Ã¤ minut kauhusta unissani. Kummallisia asioita
-- nuo unet. TiedÃ¤n kaiken aikaa uneksivani enkÃ¤ kuitenkaan voi herÃ¤tÃ¤
siitÃ¤."

"EhkÃ¤pÃ¤ se on vain mielikuvitusta", sanoi Perera. "Sitten kertovat
neekerini vielÃ¤, ettÃ¤ porroh-miehet voivat lÃ¤hettÃ¤Ã¤ kÃ¤Ã¤rmeitÃ¤. Oletteko
hiljan nÃ¤hnyt sellaisia?"

"Ainoastaan yhden. Tapoin sen tÃ¤nÃ¤ aamuna lattialla lÃ¤hellÃ¤
riippumattoani. Olin astumaisillani sen pÃ¤Ã¤lle noustessani ylÃ¶s."

"Oh!" huudahti Perera ja lisÃ¤si sitten vakuuttavasti: "Tietysti se oli
satunnaista. PitÃ¤isin kuitenkin silmÃ¤ni auki. Ja sitten on vielÃ¤
luunsÃ¤rky."

"Luulin sen johtuvan miasmasta", sanoi Pollock.

"EhkÃ¤pÃ¤ niinkin. Milloin se alkoi?"

Silloin Pollock muisti, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli ensi kerran tuntenut sitÃ¤ kahakan
jÃ¤lkeisenÃ¤ yÃ¶nÃ¤. "Minun kÃ¤sitykseni on, ettei hÃ¤n halua murhata teitÃ¤",
virkkoi Perrera -- "ei ainakaan vielÃ¤. Olen kuullut, ettÃ¤ niillÃ¤ on
tapana pelotella ja kiusata jotain ihmistÃ¤ lumoillaan, hengenvaaroilla,
luuvalolla ja pahoilla unilla ja muulla sellaisella, kunnes hÃ¤n on
kyllÃ¤stynyt elÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤. Luonnollisesti se on vaan pelkkÃ¤Ã¤ lorua. Ã„lkÃ¤Ã¤
vÃ¤littÃ¤kÃ¶ siitÃ¤... Mutta olenpa utelias tietÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n, mitÃ¤ hÃ¤n keksii
tÃ¤mÃ¤n jÃ¤lkeen."

"MinÃ¤ aijon keksiÃ¤ jotain sitÃ¤ ennen", lausui Pollock, tuijottaen
synkeÃ¤sti tahmeisiin kortteihin, joita Perera levitteli pÃ¶ydÃ¤lle.
"Minun arvolleni on alentavaa joutua tÃ¤llÃ¤ tavoin ajetuksi ja ammutuksi
ja vahingoitetuksi. Mahtaakohan tuollainen porroh-taikuri kÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤Ã¤
pelionnenkin."

HÃ¤n katsahti epÃ¤luuloisena Pereraan.

"Se on hyvin luultavaa", virkkoi Perera innokkaasti. "Se on kovin
ihmeellistÃ¤ joukkoa."

SinÃ¤ iltapÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ Pollock tappoi kaksi kÃ¤Ã¤rmettÃ¤, jotka hÃ¤n tapasi
riippumatossaan; myÃ¶skin punasia muurahaisia vilisi sillÃ¤ paikalla
entistÃ¤ enemmÃ¤n. Ja nÃ¤mÃ¤ harmit suututtivat hÃ¤ntÃ¤ niin, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n lÃ¤hti
erÃ¤Ã¤n mendi-roiston pakeille, jonka kanssa hÃ¤n oli ennenkin jutellut.
TÃ¤mÃ¤ nÃ¤ytti hÃ¤nelle muuatta pientÃ¤ rautatikaria ja osoitti, miten se
iskettiin niskaan, niin ettÃ¤ Pollockia karmi. -- ErÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤tystÃ¤
palveluksesta Pollock lupasi hÃ¤nelle kaksipiippuisen pyssyn, jossa oli
koristettu lukko.

Kun Pollock ja Perera iltasella pelasivat korttia, astui mendi ovesta
sisÃ¤Ã¤n kantaen jotain veren tahraamassa rievussa.

"Ei tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤!" virkkoi Pollock nopeasti. "Ei tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤!"

Mutta mies halusi saada kaupat pÃ¤Ã¤tetyksi eikÃ¤ Pollock ennÃ¤ttÃ¤nyt estÃ¤Ã¤
hÃ¤ntÃ¤ avaamasta vaatetta ja heittÃ¤mÃ¤stÃ¤ pÃ¶ydÃ¤lle porroh-miehen pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤.
Se ponnahti lattialle jÃ¤ttÃ¤en korteille punaset jÃ¤ljet ja vieri
nurkkaan; sinne se pysÃ¤htyi kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneenÃ¤ ylÃ¶salasin, mutta tuijottaen
tiukasti Pollockiin.

Perera kavahti seisaalleen, kun pÃ¤Ã¤ putosi korttien keskelle, ja rupesi
kiihkoissaan sÃ¤ttimÃ¤Ã¤n portugalinkielellÃ¤. Mendi kumarteli punanen
vaate kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n. "Pyssy!" hÃ¤n sanoi. Pollock tuijotti nurkassa olevaan
pÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤n. Kasvoilla oli juuri sama ilme kuin hÃ¤nen unissaankin
nÃ¤yttÃ¤ytyessÃ¤Ã¤n. Jotain tuntui napsahtavan lukkoon hÃ¤nen omissa
aivoissaan, kun hÃ¤n katseli sitÃ¤.

Sitten Perera solahti jÃ¤lleen englanninkieleen.

"Toimititteko hÃ¤net surmatuksi?" hÃ¤n kysyi. "EttekÃ¶ surmannut hÃ¤ntÃ¤
itse?"

"Miksi olisi minun pitÃ¤nyt tehdÃ¤ se?" sanoi Pollock.

"Mutta nyt ei hÃ¤n voi poistaa sitÃ¤!"

"Poistaa mitÃ¤?" kysyi Pollock.

"Ja kaikki kortit ovat aivan pilalla!"

"MitÃ¤ te tarkoitatte poistamisella?" virkkoi Pollock.

"TeidÃ¤n tÃ¤ytyy lÃ¤hettÃ¤Ã¤ minulle uusi pakka Freetownista. NiitÃ¤ saa
ostaa siellÃ¤."

"Mutta -- poistaa?"

"Se on vain taikauskoa. Unohdin sen. Neekerit sanovat, ettÃ¤ jos noidat
-- hÃ¤n oli noita -- Mutta se on pelkkÃ¤Ã¤ roskaa.... TÃ¤ytyy saada
porroh-mies palauttamaan se tai surmata hÃ¤net itse.... Se on kerrassaan
tyhmÃ¤Ã¤."

Pollock kirosi itsekseen, tuijoittaen yhÃ¤ vielÃ¤ nurkassa olevaan
pÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤n.

"En voi sietÃ¤Ã¤ tuota katsetta", hÃ¤n sanoi. Sitten hÃ¤n hyÃ¶kkÃ¤si pÃ¤Ã¤n luo
ja potkasi sitÃ¤.

Se kieri muutaman kyynÃ¤rÃ¤n matkan ja jÃ¤i sitten samaan asentoon kuin
ennenkin, kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneenÃ¤ ylÃ¶salasin ja katsoen hÃ¤neen.

"HÃ¤n on kamalan nÃ¤kÃ¶inen", virkkoi Perera. "Kerrassaan kamalan
nÃ¤kÃ¶inen. Ne viiltelevÃ¤t kasvojaan pienillÃ¤ veitsillÃ¤."

Pollock olisi uudelleen potkaissut pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤, ellei mendi-mies olisi
koskettanut hÃ¤nen kÃ¤sivarttaan. "Pyssy?" tÃ¤mÃ¤ sanoi silmÃ¤illen pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤
hermostuneesti.

"Kaksikin -- jos viet tuon kirotun kappaleen pois", lausui Pollock.

Mendi pudisti pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤Ã¤n ja teki tiettÃ¤vÃ¤ksi, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n halusi saada yhden
pyssyn, joka nyt oli tuleva hÃ¤nelle ja josta hÃ¤n olisi varsin
kiitollinen. Pollock huomasi, ettei hÃ¤neen voinut vaikuttaa
mielittelyllÃ¤ eikÃ¤ rÃ¶yhkeydellÃ¤. Pereralla oli pyssy myytÃ¤vÃ¤nÃ¤ (kolmen
sadan prosentin voitolla) ja ennen pitkÃ¤Ã¤ mies poistui se kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n.
Sitten Pollockin katseet kÃ¤Ã¤ntyivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen tahtomattaankin permannolle.

"Varsin hullunkurista, ettÃ¤ tuo pÃ¤Ã¤ aina kÃ¤Ã¤ntyy laelleen", sanoi
Perera nauraen vÃ¤kinÃ¤isesti, "HÃ¤nellÃ¤ lienee raskaat aivot; hÃ¤nen
pÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤ muistuttaa noita pikku leluja, jotka lyijypaino aina vetÃ¤Ã¤
pystyyn. TeidÃ¤n tÃ¤ytyy viedÃ¤ se mukananne, kun lÃ¤hdette. Voisitte viedÃ¤
sen nyt heti. Kortit ovat aivan pilalla. Freetownissa on muuan mies,
joka myÃ¶ niitÃ¤. Huone on kÃ¤ynyt kovin siivottomaksi. TeidÃ¤n olisi
pitÃ¤nyt surmata hÃ¤net itse."

Pollock kokosi ryhtinsÃ¤ ja nosti pÃ¤Ã¤n maasta. HÃ¤n aikoi ripustaa sen
kamarinsa katossa olevaan lamppukoukkuun ja kaivaa sille heti haudan.
HÃ¤n luuli ripustaneensa sen hiuksista, mutta varmaankin hÃ¤n oli
erehtynyt, sillÃ¤ kun hÃ¤n palasi noutamaan sitÃ¤, niin se riippui
niskasta ylÃ¶salasin.

HÃ¤n hautasi sen ennen auringonlaskua hÃ¶kkelinsÃ¤ pohjoispuolelle, jotta
hÃ¤nen ei tarvitsisi kulkea haudan ohi pimeÃ¤n aikana, kun hÃ¤n palasi
Pereran luota. Ennen maatapanoaan hÃ¤n tappoi kaksi kÃ¤Ã¤rmettÃ¤. YÃ¶n
ollessa pimeimmillÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤n herÃ¤si hÃ¤tkÃ¤htÃ¤en ja erotti tassutusta ja
raapimista. Hiljaa kohosi hÃ¤n istualleen ja veti revolverinsa esiin
pÃ¤Ã¤naluksen alta. Kuullessaan murinaa Pollock laukasi Ã¤Ã¤ntÃ¤ kohti.
Kuului, ulvahdus ja oviaukon sinervÃ¤n lÃ¤pi livahti jotain mustaa.
"Koira!" sanoi Pollock, laskeutuen jÃ¤lleen levolle.

AamuhÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤ssÃ¤ hÃ¤n herÃ¤si jÃ¤lleen omituiseen levottomuuden tunteeseen.
Tuo epÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤inen sÃ¤rky oli palannut hÃ¤nen luihinsa. Jonkun aikaa hÃ¤n
makasi tÃ¤hystellen katossa kuhisevia punasia muurahaisia ja sitten, kun
valo kÃ¤vi kirkkaammaksi, hÃ¤n katsahti riippumattonsa reunan yli ja nÃ¤ki
permannolla jonkun mustan esineen. HÃ¤n hÃ¤tkÃ¤hti niin ankarasti, ettÃ¤
riippumatto kÃ¤Ã¤ntyi nurin ja viskasi hÃ¤net maahan.

HÃ¤n huomasi makaavansa noin kyynÃ¤rÃ¤n verran porroh-miehen pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤. Koira
oli kaivanut sen maasta ja raadellut pahasti sen nenÃ¤Ã¤. Muurahaisia ja
kÃ¤rpÃ¤siÃ¤ kuhisi sen kimpussa. Kummallisen sattuman kautta se oli yhÃ¤
vielÃ¤ ylÃ¶salasin ja nurin kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneissÃ¤ silmissÃ¤ oli pirullinen ilme.

Pollock istui herpoutuneena, tuijottaen jonkun aikaa tuohon
pelÃ¤tykseen. Sitten hÃ¤n nousi ylÃ¶s, kiersi sen ympÃ¤ri -- pitkÃ¤n matkan
pÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤ -- ja astui ulos hÃ¶kkelistÃ¤. Auringon nousun kirkas valo,
kasvullisuuden eloisa liikehtiminen heikkenevÃ¤n maatuulen henkÃ¤illessÃ¤
ja tyhjÃ¤ hauta kÃ¤pÃ¤lÃ¤njÃ¤lkineen kevensivÃ¤t hiukan hÃ¤nen raskasta
mieltÃ¤Ã¤n.

HÃ¤n kertoi tapahtuman Pereralle, ikÃ¤Ã¤nkuin se olisi ollut pilajuttu --
pilajuttu joka kerrotaan kalpein huulin. "TeidÃ¤n ei olisi pitÃ¤nyt
sÃ¤ikÃ¤hyttÃ¤Ã¤ koiraa", Perera virkkoi huonosti teeskennellyllÃ¤
hilpeydellÃ¤.

Seuraavat kaksi pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ ennen hÃ¶yrylaivan tuloa Pollock vietti
koettamalla pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ todenteolla vapaaksi tuosta omaisuudestaan. HÃ¤n sai
voitetuksi vastenmielisyytensÃ¤ kÃ¤ydÃ¤ siihen kÃ¤siksi, lÃ¤hti joen suulle
ja viskasi sen meriveteen. Mutta jonkun ihmeen kautta se sÃ¤ilyi
krokotiileilta ja sen lÃ¶ysi muuan Ã¤lykÃ¤s puoli-araapialainen, joka
saapui juuri yÃ¶n korvissa kauppaamaan sitÃ¤ Pollockille ja Pereralle
muka merkillisenÃ¤ esineenÃ¤. Alkuasukas pysytteli heidÃ¤n kintereillÃ¤Ã¤n,
alentaen hintaa alentamistaan. Mutta lopulta hÃ¤neenkin tarttui se
kauhu, jota nuo valkoihoiset nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t tuntevan esinettÃ¤ kohtaan; hÃ¤n
lÃ¤hti tiehensÃ¤ ja kulkiessaan Pollockin hÃ¶kkelin ohi hÃ¤n heitti
taakkansa sinne, josta tÃ¤mÃ¤ sen sitten lÃ¶ysi aamusella.

TÃ¤stÃ¤ Pollock joutui aivan raivoihinsa. HÃ¤n aikoi polttaa koko pÃ¤Ã¤n.
Heti pÃ¤ivÃ¤n valjetessa hÃ¤n lÃ¤hti ulos ja ennen helteen tuloa hÃ¤nellÃ¤
oli jo valmiina aimo rovio risuista. Silloin hÃ¤net keskeytti pieni
Monrovian ja Bathurstin vÃ¤liÃ¤ kulkeva siipilaiva, joka saapui puhaltaen
rantariuttojen keskitse. "Taivaalle kiitos!" huudahti Pollock suurella
hartaudella, kun tuon Ã¤Ã¤nen merkitys selvisi hÃ¤nelle. Vapisevin kÃ¤sin
hÃ¤n sytytti hÃ¤tÃ¤isesti risurÃ¶ykkiÃ¶nsÃ¤, heitti pÃ¤Ã¤n siihen ja lÃ¤hti
asettamaan kuntoon matkalaukkunsa sekÃ¤ sanomaan jÃ¤Ã¤hyvÃ¤iset Pereralle.

Perinpohjaista helpotusta tuntien nÃ¤ki Pollock sinÃ¤ iltapÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ Sulyman
rÃ¤meisen rannan hÃ¤ipyvÃ¤n etÃ¤isyyteen. Joensuu, joka muodosti aukon
pitkÃ¤Ã¤n valkoiseen rantahyrskyyn, kapeni kapenemistaan. Tuntui siltÃ¤,
kuin sulkisi se syliinsÃ¤ hÃ¤nen vaivansa, vapauttaen hÃ¤net siitÃ¤. Kauhun
ja kiusan tunne alkoi vÃ¤hitellen haihtua hÃ¤nen mielestÃ¤Ã¤n. Sulymassa
oli usko porroh-miesten pahansuopaisuuteen ja taikavoimaan saastuttanut
ilman, hÃ¤netkin oli vallannut uhkaava ja kammottava tunne. Mutta
ilmeisesti porroh-miehillÃ¤ oli hallussaan vain pieni alue, pieni musta
kaistale meren ja mendien sinertÃ¤vien ylÃ¤maitten vÃ¤lillÃ¤.

"HyvÃ¤sti, porroh!" virkkoi Pollock. "HyvÃ¤sti -- eikÃ¤ _nÃ¤kemiin_!"

Laivan kapteeni saapui hÃ¤nen rinnalleen, nojasi kaidepuuhun,
toivotti hÃ¤nelle hyvÃ¤Ã¤ iltaa ja sylkÃ¤si vaahtoavaan vanaveteen
teeskentelemÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n ystÃ¤vyyden osoitukseksi.

"LÃ¶ysin rannalta kerrassaan kummallisen esineen", puheli kapteeni. "En
ole koskaan ennen tavannut sellaista Intian tÃ¤llÃ¤ puolen."

"MikÃ¤hÃ¤n se mahtaa olla?" kysyi Pollock.

"Savustettu pÃ¤Ã¤", sanoi kapteeni.

"_MikÃ¤_?" kysyi Pollock.

"IhmispÃ¤Ã¤ -- savustettu. Jonkun porroh-veijarin pÃ¤Ã¤, koristettu
viilloksilla. No! MikÃ¤s nyt tuli? EikÃ¶ mikÃ¤Ã¤n? EnpÃ¤ olisi uskonut teitÃ¤
niin hermostuneeksi. Kasvonne kÃ¤vivÃ¤t aivan viheliÃ¤isiksi. Jumalauta,
olettepa huono merimies. Kaikki hyvin? Hitto, kuinka te muutuitte!... No
niin, tuo pÃ¤Ã¤, josta juuri kerroin teille, on aika konstikas. Pistin
sen kÃ¤Ã¤rmeiden joukkoon erÃ¤Ã¤seen vÃ¤kiviina-purkkiin, jossa sÃ¤ilytÃ¤n
sellaisia merkillisyyksiÃ¤, ja piru minut perikÃ¶Ã¶n, ellei se viru
ylÃ¶salasin kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneenÃ¤. Halloo!"

Pollock oli pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤nyt kÃ¤sittÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n huudahduksen ja raastoi kÃ¤sillÃ¤Ã¤n
tukkaansa. HÃ¤n juoksi siipilaatikoita kohti, aikoen puolittain hypÃ¤tÃ¤
mereen, ja sitten hÃ¤n ymmÃ¤rsi asemansa ja kÃ¤Ã¤ntyi takaisin kapteenin
kimppuun.

"Hei!" sanoi kapteeni. "Jack Philips, pidÃ¤hÃ¤n hÃ¤net loitompana. PysykÃ¤Ã¤
erillÃ¤nne! Ei askeltakaan lÃ¤hemmÃ¤ksi, herraseni. MikÃ¤ teitÃ¤ vaivaa?
Oletteko jÃ¤rjiltÃ¤nne?"

Pollock koetteli kÃ¤dellÃ¤Ã¤n pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤nsÃ¤. Ei sitÃ¤ kannattanut selittÃ¤Ã¤,
"Luulenpa, ettÃ¤ olen toisinaan melkein mielipuoli", hÃ¤n sanoi. "Minulla
on tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ sÃ¤rkyÃ¤. Se tulee aivan Ã¤kkiÃ¤. Toivon, ettÃ¤ suotte minulle
anteeksi."

HÃ¤n oli aivan kalpea ja hiessÃ¤. Ã„kkiÃ¤ hÃ¤n kÃ¤sitti tÃ¤ysin selvÃ¤sti,
kuinka vaarallista hÃ¤nelle oli saattaa jÃ¤rkensÃ¤ epÃ¤ilyksen alaiseksi.
HÃ¤n koetti pakostakin voittaa takaisin kapteenin luottamuksen
vastaamalla hÃ¤nen ystÃ¤vÃ¤llisiin kyselyihinsÃ¤, ottamalla vaarin hÃ¤nen
ehdotuksistaan, vielÃ¤pÃ¤ maistamalla lusikallisen hÃ¤nen puhdasta
konjakkiansakin. Ja kun siitÃ¤ asiasta oli selviydytty, hÃ¤n teki joukon
kysymyksiÃ¤ kapteenin harjoittamasta eriskummallisten esineiden
kaupasta. TÃ¤mÃ¤ kuvaili pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤ varsin yksityiskohtaisesti. Pollock
kamppaili kaiken aikaa itsensÃ¤ kanssa tukahuttaakseen sen luonnottoman
luulon, ettÃ¤ laiva oli yhtÃ¤ lÃ¤pikuultava kuin lasi ja ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n saattoi
selvÃ¤sti erottaa tuon ylÃ¶salasin kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneen pÃ¤Ã¤n, joka katseli hÃ¤ntÃ¤
hÃ¤nen jalkojensa alla olevasta hytistÃ¤.

Olo laivalla oli hÃ¤nelle melkein tukalampaa kuin Sulymassa. Kaiken
pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ hÃ¤nen tÃ¤ytyi hillitÃ¤ itseÃ¤nsÃ¤, vaikka hÃ¤n tunsikin elÃ¤vÃ¤sti,
ettÃ¤ tuo kauhea pÃ¤Ã¤, joka synkisti hÃ¤nen mielensÃ¤, oli niin uhkaavan
lÃ¤hellÃ¤. YÃ¶llÃ¤ hÃ¤nen vanha painajaisensa palasi hÃ¤nen kimppuunsa,
kunnes hÃ¤n voimakkaalla ponnistuksella pakottautui valveille, kauhun
jÃ¤ykistÃ¤mÃ¤nÃ¤ ja kÃ¤heÃ¤n huudahduksen pyrkiessÃ¤ esiin hÃ¤nen kurkustaan.

HÃ¤n jÃ¤tti tuon todellisen pÃ¤Ã¤n jÃ¤lkeensÃ¤ Bathurstiin, missÃ¤ hÃ¤n siirtyi
Teneriffan laivaan, mutta unet ja ankara luuvalo eivÃ¤t luopuneet
hÃ¤nestÃ¤. Teneriffassa Pollock muutti Kapin linjalle, mutta pÃ¤Ã¤ seurasi
hÃ¤ntÃ¤. HÃ¤n pelasi korttia, koetti shakkipeliÃ¤, lukipa kirjojakin, mutta
vÃ¤kijuomat hÃ¤n tiesi vaarallisiksi. Ja kuitenkin -- milloin hyvÃ¤nsÃ¤
hÃ¤nen silmiinsÃ¤ sattui ympyriÃ¤inen musta varjo tai joku musta esine,
niin hÃ¤n otaksui sitÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤ksi ja -- nÃ¤kikin sen. HÃ¤n tiesi varsin hyvin,
ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nen mielikuvituksensa rupesi pettÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤ntÃ¤, ja kuitenkin
tuntui ajoittain siltÃ¤, kuin olisi laiva, hÃ¤nen matkustajatoverinsa,
merimiehet ja laaja ulappa kuuluneet jonkullaiseen utumaiseen
hourekuvaan, joka riippui hÃ¤nen ja kauhean todellisen maailman vÃ¤lillÃ¤,
tÃ¶in tuskin peittÃ¤en sen hÃ¤neltÃ¤. Ja ainoa kieltÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤n todellinen
esine oli porroh-mies, joka pisti pirullisen pÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤ esiin tuon verhon
lÃ¤vitse. Sellaisina hetkinÃ¤ hÃ¤n nousi ylÃ¶s ja kosketteli esineitÃ¤,
maisteli tai jyrsi jotain, poltti tulitikulla kÃ¤ttÃ¤Ã¤n tai pisti itseÃ¤Ã¤n
neulalla.

Taistellen siten hurjasti ja Ã¤Ã¤nettÃ¶mÃ¤nÃ¤ kiihtyneen mielikuvituksensa
kanssa Pollock saapui viimein Englantiin. HÃ¤n nousi maalle
Southamptonissa ja lÃ¤hti Waterloon asemalta suoraa pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤ ajurilla
pankkiirinsa luo Cornhilliin. SiellÃ¤ hÃ¤n selvitti asiansa
liikkeenhoitajan kanssa yksityisessÃ¤ huoneessa ja kaiken aikaa pÃ¤Ã¤
riippui koristeen tavoin lieden mustalta marmorireunustalta ja tihkui
verta tulisijan rautaristikolle. HÃ¤n saattoi kuulla pisarain putoilevan
ja nÃ¤hdÃ¤ niiden punaavan ristikon.

"SievÃ¤ sananjalka", virkkoi liikkeenjohtaja, seuraten hÃ¤nen katsettaan.
"Mutta se ruostuttaa ristikon."

"ErittÃ¤in sievÃ¤ sananjalka", vastasi Pollock. "Ja nytpÃ¤ muistan.
Voitteko suositella minulle jotain lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤riÃ¤ sairasmielisyyttÃ¤ vastaan?
Minua vaivaa -- miksi niitÃ¤ nimitetÃ¤Ã¤nkÃ¤Ã¤n? -- hallusinatsionit."

PÃ¤Ã¤ nauroi hurjasti, raivoisasti. Pollockia hÃ¤mmÃ¤stytti, ettei
liikkeenhoitaja kuullut sitÃ¤. Mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤ vain tuijotti hÃ¤neen.

Saatuaan lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rin osoitteen Pollock astui hetken kuluttua ulos
Cornhillille. Ei ollut ainoatakaan ajuria nÃ¤kyvissÃ¤ ja niin hÃ¤n jatkoi
matkaansa kadun lÃ¤nsipÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤n ja koetti kulkea Mansion Housea vastapÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤
olevan risteyksen poikki. Se ei juuri ole helpointa tottuneimmallekaan
lontoolaiselle: kÃ¤rryjÃ¤, vankkureita, vaunuja, postirattaita ja
omnibusseja liikkuu keskeytymÃ¤ttÃ¶mÃ¤nÃ¤ virtana; mutta sille, joka on
juuri saapunut Sierra Leonen myrkyllisistÃ¤ erÃ¤maista, se on kiehuvaa,
pyÃ¶rryttÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ sekamelskaa. Ja kun jalkojesi vÃ¤liin yhtÃ¤kkiÃ¤ kimmahtaa
kummipallon tavoin ylÃ¶salasin kÃ¤Ã¤ntynyt pÃ¤Ã¤, jÃ¤ttÃ¤en maahan sattuessaan
selviÃ¤ veritahroja, niin tuskinpa voinet vÃ¤lttÃ¤Ã¤ onnettomuutta. Pollock
nosteli jalkojansa suonenvedontapaisesti, karttaakseen sitÃ¤, ja
potkaisi sitÃ¤ sitten kiukkuisesti. Silloin hÃ¤n sai ankaran sysÃ¤yksen
selkÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤ ja pureva tuska levisi hÃ¤nen kÃ¤sivarttansa pitkin.

ErÃ¤Ã¤n omnibussin aisa oli osunut hÃ¤neen ja yksi hevosista oli
kavioillaan murskannut kolme sormea hÃ¤nen vasemmasta kÃ¤destÃ¤Ã¤n -- ja
juuri ne sormet, jotka hÃ¤n ampui porroh-mieheltÃ¤ poikki. HÃ¤net
vedettiin esiin hevosten jaloista ja hÃ¤nen musertuneesta kÃ¤destÃ¤Ã¤n
tavattiin lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rin osoite.

Pariin pÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤n ei Pollock tajunnut muuta kuin kloroformin Ã¤itelÃ¤Ã¤
kirpeÃ¤tÃ¤ tuoksua, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤ntÃ¤ leikattiin, vaikka ei hÃ¤n tuntenut mitÃ¤Ã¤n
kipua, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n makasi hiljaa ja ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nelle annettiin ruokaa ja
juomaa. Sitten hÃ¤n sai hiukan kuumetta, kÃ¤vi perin janoiseksi ja hÃ¤nen
vanha painajaisensa palasi uudelleen. Vasta sen ilmetessÃ¤ hÃ¤n huomasi,
ettÃ¤ se oli jÃ¤ttÃ¤nyt hÃ¤net rauhaan yhdeksi pÃ¤ivÃ¤ksi.

"Jos pÃ¤Ã¤ni olisi murskautunut sormieni sijasta, niin kenties siitÃ¤
olisi pÃ¤Ã¤ssyt kokonaan", virkkoi Pollock, tuijottaen miettivÃ¤isenÃ¤
erÃ¤Ã¤seen tummaan pielukseen, joka oli ruvennut nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n pÃ¤Ã¤ltÃ¤.

Ensi tilassa Pollock kertoi lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rille mielenhÃ¤iriÃ¶stÃ¤Ã¤n. HÃ¤n tunsi
selvÃ¤sti tulevansa hulluksi, ellei keksittÃ¤isi jotain parannuskeinoa.
HÃ¤n selitti nÃ¤hneensÃ¤ Dahomeyssa erÃ¤Ã¤n mestauksen ja ettÃ¤ erÃ¤s pÃ¤Ã¤
kummitteli nyt hÃ¤nen mielessÃ¤Ã¤n. Luonnollisesti hÃ¤n ei vÃ¤littÃ¤nyt
kertoa mitÃ¤Ã¤n todellisesta tapahtumasta. LÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤ri nÃ¤ytti vakavalta.

Hetken kuluttua hÃ¤n virkkoi epÃ¤rÃ¶iden. "Saitteko lapsena paljon
uskonnollista ohjausta?"

"Varsin vÃ¤hÃ¤n", Pollock vastasi.

LÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rin kasvot synkistyivÃ¤t hetkeksi. "En tiedÃ¤, oletteko kuullut
ihmeparannuksista -- tietysti ei niiden silti tarvitse olla ihmeitÃ¤ --
niitÃ¤ toimitetaan Lourdesissa."

"PelkÃ¤Ã¤n pahoin, etten minÃ¤ juuri kelpaa uskolla lÃ¤Ã¤kittÃ¤vÃ¤ksi",
Pollock lausui tuijottaen tummaan pielukseen.

PÃ¤Ã¤ vÃ¤Ã¤nsi arpiset piirteensÃ¤ inhoittavaan irvistykseen. LÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤ri
siirtyi uudelle uralle.

"Se on pelkkÃ¤Ã¤ mielikuvitusta", hÃ¤n sanoi, ruveten Ã¤kkiÃ¤ puhumaan
reippaasti. "Joka tapauksessa hyvÃ¤ tilaisuus uskoparannukseen. TeidÃ¤n
hermostonne on kurjassa kunnossa, te olette tuollaisessa terveydellisen
hÃ¤mÃ¤ryyden tilassa, jolloin kummitukset kernaimmin saapuvat.
Mainitsemanne vaikutelma oli teille liian voimakas. Valmistan teille
hiukan lÃ¤Ã¤kettÃ¤, joka vahvistaa hermostoanne -- etenkin aivojanne. Ja
teidÃ¤n tÃ¤ytyy hankkia ruumiinliikuntoa."

"MinÃ¤ en kelpaa uskoparannukseen", sanoi Pollock.

"Ja sen vuoksi meidÃ¤n on parannettava mieliala. LÃ¤htekÃ¤Ã¤ etsimÃ¤Ã¤n
virkistÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ ilmaa -- Skotlantiin, Norjaan, Alpeille" --

"Vaikka Jerikoon, jos haluatte" -- virkkoi Pollock -- "minne Naamankin
lÃ¤hti."

Mutta niin pian kuin hÃ¤nen sormensa sen sallivat, Pollock koetti
urheasti seurata lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rin neuvoa. HÃ¤n yritti pelata jalkapalloa, mutta
hÃ¤nen mielestÃ¤Ã¤n se oli raivoisan ylÃ¶salasin kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneen pÃ¤Ã¤n potkimista
kenttÃ¤Ã¤ pitkin. HÃ¤n ei kelvannut siihen kisaan. HÃ¤n potki sokeasti,
jonkunlaisella kauhulla, ja kun hÃ¤net asetettiin maalivahdiksi ja pallo
tulla hujahutti hÃ¤ntÃ¤ kohti, niin hÃ¤n Ã¤lÃ¤hti Ã¤kisti ja pakeni sen
tieltÃ¤. Ne arvoa alentavat jutut, joiden vuoksi hÃ¤nen oli tÃ¤ytynyt
paeta Englannista vaeltamaan kuuman vyÃ¶hykkeen maissa, eivÃ¤t sentÃ¤Ã¤n
olleet sulkeneet hÃ¤ntÃ¤ pois miesten seurasta; mutta nyt hÃ¤nen
menettelynsÃ¤, joka kÃ¤vi yhÃ¤ omituisemmaksi, saattoi miesystÃ¤vÃ¤tkin
karttamaan hÃ¤ntÃ¤. EikÃ¤ tuo esine ollut enÃ¤Ã¤ vain silmiin kuvastuva
kappale, se mongerteli ja puheli hÃ¤nelle. HÃ¤ntÃ¤ rupesi kauheasti
pelottamaan, ettÃ¤ kun hÃ¤n tarttui tuohon kummitukseen, se ei enÃ¤Ã¤
muuttuisikaan joksikin huonekalustoon kuuluvaksi esineeksi, vaan
_tuntuisi_ oikealta katkaistulta pÃ¤Ã¤ltÃ¤. Yksin ollessaan hÃ¤n sadatteli
sitÃ¤, pilkkaili ja uhkaili sitÃ¤; kerran tai pari hÃ¤n puhutteli sitÃ¤
toisten seurassa, vaikka hÃ¤n koettikin epÃ¤toivoisesti hillitÃ¤ itseÃ¤Ã¤n.
HÃ¤n tunsi epÃ¤luulon enenevÃ¤n niiden silmissÃ¤, jotka tarkkasivat hÃ¤ntÃ¤
-- emÃ¤ntÃ¤nsÃ¤ ja palvelijansa. ErÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ hÃ¤nen serkkunsa Arnold --
hÃ¤nen lÃ¤hin sukulaisensa -- saapui tervehtimÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤ntÃ¤ ja houkuttelemaan
hÃ¤ntÃ¤ ulos -- ja tarkastelemaan hÃ¤nen kuoppaisia kellertÃ¤viÃ¤ kasvojaan
uteliain silmin. Ja Pollockista tuntui, ettÃ¤ hattu, jota serkku piti
kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n, ei ollutkaan mikÃ¤Ã¤n hattu, vaan Gorgon-pÃ¤Ã¤, joko tuijotti
hÃ¤neen ylÃ¶salasin kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneenÃ¤ ja uhkasi katseillaan hÃ¤nen jÃ¤rkeÃ¤nsÃ¤.
Mutta hÃ¤n pÃ¤Ã¤tti yhÃ¤ vielÃ¤ vapautua siitÃ¤. HÃ¤n hankki polkupyÃ¶rÃ¤n ja
ajaessaan routaista tietÃ¤ pitkin WandsworthistÃ¤ Kingstoniin hÃ¤n Ã¤kkÃ¤si
sen vierivÃ¤n hÃ¤nen rinnallaan ja jÃ¤ttÃ¤vÃ¤n tumman juovan jÃ¤lkeensÃ¤. HÃ¤n
puri hampaansa yhteen ja ajoi joutuisammin. Silloin yhtÃ¤kkiÃ¤, juuri kun
hÃ¤n laski alamÃ¤keÃ¤ Richmond-puistoa kohti, kummitus kieri hÃ¤nen eteensÃ¤
ja pyÃ¶rÃ¤n alle niin nopeasti, ettei hÃ¤n ennÃ¤ttÃ¤nyt ajatella mitÃ¤Ã¤n.
KÃ¤Ã¤ntyessÃ¤Ã¤n Ã¤kkiÃ¤ vÃ¤lttÃ¤Ã¤kseen sitÃ¤, hÃ¤n syÃ¶ksyi rajusti muuatta
kivirÃ¶ykkiÃ¶tÃ¤ vastaan ja taittoi vasemman ranteensa.

Juttu pÃ¤Ã¤ttyi juolu-aamuna. HÃ¤n oli maannut kuumeessa kaiken yÃ¶tÃ¤,
siteet polttivat hÃ¤nen rannettaan tulisen renkaan tavoin ja hÃ¤n oli
uneksinut elÃ¤vÃ¤mmin ja kamalammin kuin koskaan ennen. Koleassa,
vÃ¤rittÃ¶mÃ¤ssÃ¤, epÃ¤varmassa valossa, joka vallitsi ennen auringon nousua,
hÃ¤n kohousi vuoteessaan istumaan ja nÃ¤ki pÃ¤Ã¤n makaavan erÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤
jalustalla pronssimaljan sijasta, joka oli ollut siinÃ¤ yÃ¶n aikana.

"TiedÃ¤n kyllÃ¤, ettÃ¤ se on pronssimalja", hÃ¤n virkkoi, kaamean
epÃ¤ilyksen kouristaessa hÃ¤nen sydÃ¤ntÃ¤Ã¤n. Ennen pitkÃ¤Ã¤ epÃ¤ilys valtasi
hÃ¤net kokonaan. Verkalleen ja vÃ¤risten hÃ¤n nousi vuoteeltaan ja astui
kÃ¤si koholla maljaa kohti. Nyt hÃ¤n saisi varmasti huomata, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤nen
mielikuvituksensa oli pettÃ¤nyt hÃ¤net, hÃ¤n saisi tuntea selvÃ¤sti
pronssin sileÃ¤n pinnan. EpÃ¤rÃ¶ityÃ¤Ã¤n kokonaisen ikuisuuden ajan hÃ¤n
laski lopulta sormensa pÃ¤Ã¤n uurteiselle poskelle. HÃ¤n veti ne takaisin
suonenvedontapaisesti. Huippukohta oli saavutettu. Tuntoaistikin oli
pettÃ¤nyt hÃ¤net.

Vavisten, kolahtaen vuoteeseensa, potkien jalkineitaan paljailla
jaloillaan, kaiken pyÃ¶riessÃ¤ hÃ¤nen ympÃ¤rillÃ¤Ã¤n tummassa sekamelskassa,
hÃ¤n kulki haparoiden peilipÃ¶ytÃ¤nsÃ¤ luo, otti partaveitsensÃ¤ esiin
laatikosta ja istui vuoteelleen pitÃ¤en sitÃ¤ kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n. Kuvastimesta hÃ¤n
nÃ¤ki omat kasvonsa verettÃ¶minÃ¤, kuihtuneina, tÃ¤ynnÃ¤ Ã¤Ã¤rimmÃ¤isen
epÃ¤toivon katkeruutta.

Nopeasti kuvastuivat hÃ¤nen lyhyen elÃ¤mÃ¤ntarinansa tapahtumat hÃ¤nen
mieleensÃ¤. Kurja koti, vielÃ¤ kurjempi koulu-aika, myÃ¶hempien vuosien
huono elÃ¤mÃ¤, jossa toinen kunniaton teko seurasi toista; pÃ¤ivÃ¤nkoiton
koleassa valaistuksessa kaikki tuo rietas mielettÃ¶myys nÃ¤kyi nyt niin
armottoman selvÃ¤sti. Sitten seurasivat oleskelu majassa, kahakka
porroh-miehen kanssa, paluumatka jokea pitkin alas Sulymaan,
mendilÃ¤is-salamurhaaja punaisine liinoineen, hurjat yritykset tuhota
tuo pÃ¤Ã¤, hÃ¤nen mielikuvitelmansa kasvaminen. Se oli mielikuvitelma! HÃ¤n
_tiesi_ sen. PelkkÃ¤ mielikuvitelma. Hetkiseksi hÃ¤n tapaili toivoa. HÃ¤n
siirsi katseensa kuvastimesta jalustaan, ylÃ¶salasin kÃ¤Ã¤ntynyt pÃ¤Ã¤
irvisti hÃ¤nelle... Sidotun kÃ¤tensÃ¤ jÃ¤ykistyneillÃ¤ sormilla hÃ¤n etsi
tykyttÃ¤viÃ¤ valtimoitansa. Aamu oli sangen kylmÃ¤, veitsen terÃ¤ tuntui
aivan kuin jÃ¤Ã¤ltÃ¤.

THE PREFACE


The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and
conceal the artist is artâ€™s aim. The critic is he who can translate
into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful
things.

The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without
being charming. This is a fault.

Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the
cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom
beautiful things mean only beauty.

There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well
written, or badly written. That is all.

The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing
his own face in a glass.

The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban
not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of
the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in
the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove
anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has
ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable
mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express
everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an
art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the
point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the
musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actorâ€™s craft is the
type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the
surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their
peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,
complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with
himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he
does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that
one admires it intensely.

All art is quite useless.

OSCAR WILDE




CHAPTER I.


The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light
summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through
the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate
perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was
lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry
Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured
blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to
bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then
the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,
producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of
those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of
an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of
swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their
way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous
insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,
seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London
was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the
full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,
and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist
himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago
caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many
strange conjectures.

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so
skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his
face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and
closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought
to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he
might awake.

â€œIt is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,â€ said
Lord Henry languidly. â€œYou must certainly send it next year to the
Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have
gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been
able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that
I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor
is really the only place.â€

â€œI donâ€™t think I shall send it anywhere,â€ he answered, tossing his head
back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at
Oxford. â€œNo, I wonâ€™t send it anywhere.â€

Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through
the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls
from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. â€œNot send it anywhere? My dear
fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You
do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,
you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is
only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is
not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above
all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if
old men are ever capable of any emotion.â€

â€œI know you will laugh at me,â€ he replied, â€œbut I really canâ€™t exhibit
it. I have put too much of myself into it.â€

Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.

â€œYes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.â€

â€œToo much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didnâ€™t know you
were so vain; and I really canâ€™t see any resemblance between you, with
your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young
Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,
my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and youâ€”well, of course you have an
intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends
where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode
of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one
sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something
horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.
How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But
then in the Church they donâ€™t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the
age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,
and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.
Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but
whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of
that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here
in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer
when we want something to chill our intelligence. Donâ€™t flatter
yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t understand me, Harry,â€ answered the artist. â€œOf course I am
not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to
look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.
There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,
the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering
steps of kings. It is better not to be different from oneâ€™s fellows.
The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit
at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,
they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all
should liveâ€”undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They
neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.
Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they areâ€”my art,
whatever it may be worth; Dorian Grayâ€™s good looksâ€”we shall all suffer
for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.â€

â€œDorian Gray? Is that his name?â€ asked Lord Henry, walking across the
studio towards Basil Hallward.

â€œYes, that is his name. I didnâ€™t intend to tell it to you.â€

â€œBut why not?â€

â€œOh, I canâ€™t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their
names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown
to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life
mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if
one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I
am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,
I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into
oneâ€™s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?â€

â€œNot at all,â€ answered Lord Henry, â€œnot at all, my dear Basil. You seem
to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it
makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I
never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.
When we meetâ€”we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go
down to the Dukeâ€™sâ€”we tell each other the most absurd stories with the
most serious faces. My wife is very good at itâ€”much better, in fact,
than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But
when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish
she would; but she merely laughs at me.â€

â€œI hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,â€ said Basil
Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. â€œI
believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are
thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary
fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.
Your cynicism is simply a pose.â€

â€œBeing natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,â€
cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the
garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that
stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the
polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.

After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. â€œI am afraid I must be
going, Basil,â€ he murmured, â€œand before I go, I insist on your
answering a question I put to you some time ago.â€

â€œWhat is that?â€ said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.

â€œYou know quite well.â€

â€œI do not, Harry.â€

â€œWell, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you
wonâ€™t exhibit Dorian Grayâ€™s picture. I want the real reason.â€

â€œI told you the real reason.â€

â€œNo, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of
yourself in it. Now, that is childish.â€

â€œHarry,â€ said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, â€œevery
portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not
of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is
not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on
the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit
this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of
my own soul.â€

Lord Henry laughed. â€œAnd what is that?â€ he asked.

â€œI will tell you,â€ said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came
over his face.

â€œI am all expectation, Basil,â€ continued his companion, glancing at
him.

â€œOh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,â€ answered the painter;
â€œand I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly
believe it.â€

Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from
the grass and examined it. â€œI am quite sure I shall understand it,â€ he
replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,
â€œand as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it
is quite incredible.â€

The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy
lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the
languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a
blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze
wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallwardâ€™s heart
beating, and wondered what was coming.

â€œThe story is simply this,â€ said the painter after some time. â€œTwo
months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandonâ€™s. You know we poor
artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to
remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a
white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain
a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room
about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious
academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at
me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.
When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation
of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some
one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to
do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art
itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know
yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my
own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.
Thenâ€”but I donâ€™t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to
tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had
a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was
not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take
no credit to myself for trying to escape.â€

â€œConscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience
is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.â€

â€œI donâ€™t believe that, Harry, and I donâ€™t believe you do either.
However, whatever was my motiveâ€”and it may have been pride, for I used
to be very proudâ€”I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I
stumbled against Lady Brandon. â€˜You are not going to run away so soon,
Mr. Hallward?â€™ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?â€

â€œYes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,â€ said Lord Henry,
pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.

â€œI could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people
with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and
parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her
once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe
some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had
been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the
nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself
face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely
stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.
It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.
Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We
would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of
that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined
to know each other.â€

â€œAnd how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?â€ asked his
companion. â€œI know she goes in for giving a rapid _prÃ©cis_ of all her
guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old
gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my
ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to
everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I
like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests
exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them
entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants
to know.â€

â€œPoor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!â€ said Hallward
listlessly.

â€œMy dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in
opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she
say about Mr. Dorian Gray?â€

â€œOh, something like, â€˜Charming boyâ€”poor dear mother and I absolutely
inseparable. Quite forget what he doesâ€”afraid heâ€”doesnâ€™t do
anythingâ€”oh, yes, plays the pianoâ€”or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?â€™
Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.â€

â€œLaughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far
the best ending for one,â€ said the young lord, plucking another daisy.

Hallward shook his head. â€œYou donâ€™t understand what friendship is,
Harry,â€ he murmuredâ€”â€œor what enmity is, for that matter. You like every
one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.â€

â€œHow horribly unjust of you!â€ cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back
and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of
glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the
summer sky. â€œYes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference
between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my
acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good
intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I
have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual
power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of
me? I think it is rather vain.â€

â€œI should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be
merely an acquaintance.â€

â€œMy dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.â€

â€œAnd much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?â€

â€œOh, brothers! I donâ€™t care for brothers. My elder brother wonâ€™t die,
and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.â€

â€œHarry!â€ exclaimed Hallward, frowning.

â€œMy dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I canâ€™t help detesting my
relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand
other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize
with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices
of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and
immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of
us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When
poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite
magnificent. And yet I donâ€™t suppose that ten per cent of the
proletariat live correctly.â€

â€œI donâ€™t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is
more, Harry, I feel sure you donâ€™t either.â€

Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his
patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. â€œHow English you are
Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one
puts forward an idea to a true Englishmanâ€”always a rash thing to doâ€”he
never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The
only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it
oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with
the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities
are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual
will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his
wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I donâ€™t propose to
discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons
better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better
than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.
How often do you see him?â€

â€œEvery day. I couldnâ€™t be happy if I didnâ€™t see him every day. He is
absolutely necessary to me.â€

â€œHow extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but
your art.â€

â€œHe is all my art to me now,â€ said the painter gravely. â€œI sometimes
think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the
worldâ€™s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,
and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.
What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of
Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will
some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from
him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much
more to me than a model or a sitter. I wonâ€™t tell you that I am
dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such
that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,
and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good
work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious wayâ€”I wonder
will you understand me?â€”his personality has suggested to me an entirely
new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things
differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a
way that was hidden from me before. â€˜A dream of form in days of
thoughtâ€™â€”who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray
has been to me. The merely visible presence of this ladâ€”for he seems to
me little more than a lad, though he is really over twentyâ€”his merely
visible presenceâ€”ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?
Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school
that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the
perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and
bodyâ€”how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and
have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.
Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that
landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but
which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever
done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray
sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the
first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had
always looked for and always missed.â€

â€œBasil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.â€

Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After
some time he came back. â€œHarry,â€ he said, â€œDorian Gray is to me simply
a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.
He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.
He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the
curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain
colours. That is all.â€

â€œThen why wonâ€™t you exhibit his portrait?â€ asked Lord Henry.

â€œBecause, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of
all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never
cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know
anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my
soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under
their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harryâ€”too
much of myself!â€

â€œPoets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion
is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.â€

â€œI hate them for it,â€ cried Hallward. â€œAn artist should create
beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We
live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of
autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I
will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall
never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.â€

â€œI think you are wrong, Basil, but I wonâ€™t argue with you. It is only
the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very
fond of you?â€

The painter considered for a few moments. â€œHe likes me,â€ he answered
after a pause; â€œI know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.
I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall
be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit
in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he
is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me
pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some
one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of
decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summerâ€™s day.â€

â€œDays in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,â€ murmured Lord Henry.
â€œPerhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think
of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That
accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate
ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have
something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and
facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly
well-informed manâ€”that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the
thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a
_bric-Ã -brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above
its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day
you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little
out of drawing, or you wonâ€™t like his tone of colour, or something. You
will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that
he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be
perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will
alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art
one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is
that it leaves one so unromantic.â€

â€œHarry, donâ€™t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of
Dorian Gray will dominate me. You canâ€™t feel what I feel. You change
too often.â€

â€œAh, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are
faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who
know loveâ€™s tragedies.â€ And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty
silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and
satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was
a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,
and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like
swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other
peopleâ€™s emotions were!â€”much more delightful than their ideas, it
seemed to him. Oneâ€™s own soul, and the passions of oneâ€™s friendsâ€”those
were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent
amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long
with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his auntâ€™s, he would have been sure
to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have
been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model
lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those
virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.
The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown
eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped
all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He
turned to Hallward and said, â€œMy dear fellow, I have just remembered.â€

â€œRemembered what, Harry?â€

â€œWhere I heard the name of Dorian Gray.â€

â€œWhere was it?â€ asked Hallward, with a slight frown.

â€œDonâ€™t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agathaâ€™s. She told
me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her
in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state
that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation
of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very
earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a
creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping
about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.â€

â€œI am very glad you didnâ€™t, Harry.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œI donâ€™t want you to meet him.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t want me to meet him?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œMr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,â€ said the butler, coming into
the garden.

â€œYou must introduce me now,â€ cried Lord Henry, laughing.

The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.
â€œAsk Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.â€ The man
bowed and went up the walk.

Then he looked at Lord Henry. â€œDorian Gray is my dearest friend,â€ he
said. â€œHe has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite
right in what she said of him. Donâ€™t spoil him. Donâ€™t try to influence
him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many
marvellous people in it. Donâ€™t take away from me the one person who
gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist
depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.â€ He spoke very slowly, and
the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.

â€œWhat nonsense you talk!â€ said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward
by the arm, he almost led him into the house.




CHAPTER II.


As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with
his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumannâ€™s
â€œForest Scenes.â€ â€œYou must lend me these, Basil,â€ he cried. â€œI want to
learn them. They are perfectly charming.â€

â€œThat entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.â€

â€œOh, I am tired of sitting, and I donâ€™t want a life-sized portrait of
myself,â€ answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a
wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint
blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. â€œI beg your
pardon, Basil, but I didnâ€™t know you had any one with you.â€

â€œThis is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I
have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you
have spoiled everything.â€

â€œYou have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,â€ said Lord
Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. â€œMy aunt has often
spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am
afraid, one of her victims also.â€

â€œI am in Lady Agathaâ€™s black books at present,â€ answered Dorian with a
funny look of penitence. â€œI promised to go to a club in Whitechapel
with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to
have played a duet togetherâ€”three duets, I believe. I donâ€™t know what
she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.â€

â€œOh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.
And I donâ€™t think it really matters about your not being there. The
audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to
the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.â€

â€œThat is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,â€ answered Dorian,
laughing.

Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,
with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp
gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at
once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youthâ€™s
passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the
world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.

â€œYou are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Grayâ€”far too
charming.â€ And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened
his cigarette-case.

The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes
ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henryâ€™s last
remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,
â€œHarry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it
awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?â€

Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. â€œAm I to go, Mr. Gray?â€ he
asked.

â€œOh, please donâ€™t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky
moods, and I canâ€™t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell
me why I should not go in for philanthropy.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a
subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly
shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You donâ€™t
really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your
sitters to have some one to chat to.â€

Hallward bit his lip. â€œIf Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.
Dorianâ€™s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.â€

Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. â€œYou are very pressing, Basil,
but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the
Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon
Street. I am nearly always at home at five oâ€™clock. Write to me when
you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.â€

â€œBasil,â€ cried Dorian Gray, â€œif Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,
too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is
horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask
him to stay. I insist upon it.â€

â€œStay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,â€ said Hallward,
gazing intently at his picture. â€œIt is quite true, I never talk when I
am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious
for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.â€

â€œBut what about my man at the Orleans?â€

The painter laughed. â€œI donâ€™t think there will be any difficulty about
that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,
and donâ€™t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry
says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single
exception of myself.â€

Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek
martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom
he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a
delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few
moments he said to him, â€œHave you really a very bad influence, Lord
Henry? As bad as Basil says?â€

â€œThere is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is
immoralâ€”immoral from the scientific point of view.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œBecause to influence a person is to give him oneâ€™s own soul. He does
not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His
virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as
sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one elseâ€™s music, an
actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is
self-development. To realize oneâ€™s nature perfectlyâ€”that is what each
of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have
forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneâ€™s
self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe
the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone
out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,
which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of
religionâ€”these are the two things that govern us. And yetâ€”â€

â€œJust turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good
boy,â€ said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look
had come into the ladâ€™s face that he had never seen there before.

â€œAnd yet,â€ continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with
that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of
him, and that he had even in his Eton days, â€œI believe that if one man
were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to
every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dreamâ€”I
believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we
would forget all the maladies of mediÃ¦valism, and return to the
Hellenic idealâ€”to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it
may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The
mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial
that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse
that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body
sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of
purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,
or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is
to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for
the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its
monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that
the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the
brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place
also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your
rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,
thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping
dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shameâ€”â€

â€œStop!â€ faltered Dorian Gray, â€œstop! you bewilder me. I donâ€™t know what
to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Donâ€™t speak.
Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.â€

For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and
eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh
influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come
really from himself. The few words that Basilâ€™s friend had said to
himâ€”words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in
themâ€”had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,
but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.

Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But
music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another
chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they
were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.
And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able
to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their
own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything
so real as words?

Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.
He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It
seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known
it?

With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise
psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.
He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,
and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book
which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he
wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.
He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How
fascinating the lad was!

Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had
the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes
only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.

â€œBasil, I am tired of standing,â€ cried Dorian Gray suddenly. â€œI must go
out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.â€

â€œMy dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I canâ€™t think of
anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And
I have caught the effect I wantedâ€”the half-parted lips and the bright
look in the eyes. I donâ€™t know what Harry has been saying to you, but
he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose
he has been paying you compliments. You mustnâ€™t believe a word that he
says.â€

â€œHe has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the
reason that I donâ€™t believe anything he has told me.â€

â€œYou know you believe it all,â€ said Lord Henry, looking at him with his
dreamy languorous eyes. â€œI will go out to the garden with you. It is
horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,
something with strawberries in it.â€

â€œCertainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will
tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I
will join you later on. Donâ€™t keep Dorian too long. I have never been
in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my
masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.â€

Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his
face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their
perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand
upon his shoulder. â€œYou are quite right to do that,â€ he murmured.
â€œNothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the
senses but the soul.â€

The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had
tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There
was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are
suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some
hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.

â€œYes,â€ continued Lord Henry, â€œthat is one of the great secrets of
lifeâ€”to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means
of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think
you know, just as you know less than you want to know.â€

Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking
the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,
olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was
something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His
cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,
as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.
But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been
left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil
Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered
him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to
have disclosed to him lifeâ€™s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be
afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be
frightened.

â€œLet us go and sit in the shade,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œParker has brought
out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be
quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must
not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.â€

â€œWhat can it matter?â€ cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on
the seat at the end of the garden.

â€œIt should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œBecause you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing
worth having.â€

â€œI donâ€™t feel that, Lord Henry.â€

â€œNo, you donâ€™t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and
ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion
branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will
feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it
always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.
Donâ€™t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of geniusâ€”is higher,
indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great
facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in
dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be
questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of
those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you wonâ€™t
smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That
may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,
beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not
judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not
the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But
what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in
which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your
beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there
are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those
mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than
defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something
dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your
roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You
will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.
Donâ€™t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying
to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the
ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the
false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!
Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.
Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonismâ€”that is what our century wants.
You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing
you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment
I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,
of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me
that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how
tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time
that your youth will lastâ€”such a little time. The common hill-flowers
wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next
June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the
clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold
its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy
that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses
rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the
passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite
temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!
There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!â€

Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell
from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for
a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe
of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in
trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make
us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we
cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays
sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the
bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian
convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and
fro.

Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made
staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and
smiled.

â€œI am waiting,â€ he cried. â€œDo come in. The light is quite perfect, and
you can bring your drinks.â€

They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white
butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of
the garden a thrush began to sing.

â€œYou are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,â€ said Lord Henry, looking at
him.

â€œYes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?â€

â€œAlways! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.
Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to
make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only
difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice
lasts a little longer.â€

As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henryâ€™s
arm. â€œIn that case, let our friendship be a caprice,â€ he murmured,
flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and
resumed his pose.

Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.
The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that
broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back
to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that
streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The
heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.

After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for
a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,
biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. â€œIt is quite
finished,â€ he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in
long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.

Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a
wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.

â€œMy dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,â€ he said. â€œIt is the
finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at
yourself.â€

The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.

â€œIs it really finished?â€ he murmured, stepping down from the platform.

â€œQuite finished,â€ said the painter. â€œAnd you have sat splendidly
to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.â€

â€œThat is entirely due to me,â€ broke in Lord Henry. â€œIsnâ€™t it, Mr.
Gray?â€

Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture
and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks
flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,
as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there
motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to
him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own
beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.
Basil Hallwardâ€™s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the
charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed
at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had
come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his
terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and
now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full
reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a
day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and
colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet
would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The
life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become
dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.

As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a
knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes
deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt
as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.

â€œDonâ€™t you like it?â€ cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the
ladâ€™s silence, not understanding what it meant.

â€œOf course he likes it,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œWho wouldnâ€™t like it? It is
one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you
like to ask for it. I must have it.â€

â€œIt is not my property, Harry.â€

â€œWhose property is it?â€

â€œDorianâ€™s, of course,â€ answered the painter.

â€œHe is a very lucky fellow.â€

â€œHow sad it is!â€ murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon
his own portrait. â€œHow sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and
dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be
older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other
way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was
to grow old! For thatâ€”for thatâ€”I would give everything! Yes, there is
nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for
that!â€

â€œYou would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,â€ cried Lord
Henry, laughing. â€œIt would be rather hard lines on your work.â€

â€œI should object very strongly, Harry,â€ said Hallward.

Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. â€œI believe you would, Basil. You
like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a
green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.â€

The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like
that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed
and his cheeks burning.

â€œYes,â€ he continued, â€œI am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your
silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till
I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses
oneâ€™s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your
picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth
is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I
shall kill myself.â€

Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. â€œDorian! Dorian!â€ he cried,
â€œdonâ€™t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I
shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,
are you?â€”you who are finer than any of them!â€

â€œI am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of
the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must
lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives
something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture
could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint
it? It will mock me some dayâ€”mock me horribly!â€ The hot tears welled
into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the
divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.

â€œThis is your doing, Harry,â€ said the painter bitterly.

Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. â€œIt is the real Dorian Grayâ€”that is
all.â€

â€œIt is not.â€

â€œIf it is not, what have I to do with it?â€

â€œYou should have gone away when I asked you,â€ he muttered.

â€œI stayed when you asked me,â€ was Lord Henryâ€™s answer.

â€œHarry, I canâ€™t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between
you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever
done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will
not let it come across our three lives and mar them.â€

Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid
face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal
painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was
he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin
tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long
palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at
last. He was going to rip up the canvas.

With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to
Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of
the studio. â€œDonâ€™t, Basil, donâ€™t!â€ he cried. â€œIt would be murder!â€

â€œI am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,â€ said the painter
coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. â€œI never thought you
would.â€

â€œAppreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I
feel that.â€

â€œWell, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and
sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.â€ And he walked
across the room and rang the bell for tea. â€œYou will have tea, of
course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple
pleasures?â€

â€œI adore simple pleasures,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œThey are the last refuge
of the complex. But I donâ€™t like scenes, except on the stage. What
absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as
a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man
is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after
allâ€”though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You
had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesnâ€™t really
want it, and I really do.â€

â€œIf you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!â€
cried Dorian Gray; â€œand I donâ€™t allow people to call me a silly boy.â€

â€œYou know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it
existed.â€

â€œAnd you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you
donâ€™t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.â€

â€œI should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.â€

â€œAh! this morning! You have lived since then.â€

There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden
tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a
rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.
Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray
went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to
the table and examined what was under the covers.

â€œLet us go to the theatre to-night,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œThere is sure to
be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at Whiteâ€™s, but it
is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am
ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent
engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have
all the surprise of candour.â€

â€œIt is such a bore putting on oneâ€™s dress-clothes,â€ muttered Hallward.
â€œAnd, when one has them on, they are so horrid.â€

â€œYes,â€ answered Lord Henry dreamily, â€œthe costume of the nineteenth
century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only
real colour-element left in modern life.â€

â€œYou really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.â€

â€œBefore which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one
in the picture?â€

â€œBefore either.â€

â€œI should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,â€ said the
lad.

â€œThen you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, wonâ€™t you?â€

â€œI canâ€™t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.â€

â€œWell, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.â€

â€œI should like that awfully.â€

The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.
â€œI shall stay with the real Dorian,â€ he said, sadly.

â€œIs it the real Dorian?â€ cried the original of the portrait, strolling
across to him. â€œAm I really like that?â€

â€œYes; you are just like that.â€

â€œHow wonderful, Basil!â€

â€œAt least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,â€
sighed Hallward. â€œThat is something.â€

â€œWhat a fuss people make about fidelity!â€ exclaimed Lord Henry. â€œWhy,
even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to
do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old
men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.â€

â€œDonâ€™t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,â€ said Hallward. â€œStop and
dine with me.â€

â€œI canâ€™t, Basil.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œBecause I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.â€

â€œHe wonâ€™t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always
breaks his own. I beg you not to go.â€

Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.

â€œI entreat you.â€

The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them
from the tea-table with an amused smile.

â€œI must go, Basil,â€ he answered.

â€œVery well,â€ said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on
the tray. â€œIt is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better
lose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.
Come to-morrow.â€

â€œCertainly.â€

â€œYou wonâ€™t forget?â€

â€œNo, of course not,â€ cried Dorian.

â€œAnd ... Harry!â€

â€œYes, Basil?â€

â€œRemember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.â€

â€œI have forgotten it.â€

â€œI trust you.â€

â€œI wish I could trust myself,â€ said Lord Henry, laughing. â€œCome, Mr.
Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.
Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.â€

As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a
sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.




CHAPTER III.


At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon
Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial
if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called
selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was
considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His
father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and
Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a
capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at
Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by
reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,
and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his
fatherâ€™s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat
foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months
later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great
aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town
houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and
took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the
management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself
for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of
having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of
burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when
the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them
for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied
him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.
Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the
country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but
there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.

When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough
shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. â€œWell,
Harry,â€ said the old gentleman, â€œwhat brings you out so early? I
thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till
five.â€

â€œPure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get
something out of you.â€

â€œMoney, I suppose,â€ said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. â€œWell, sit
down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that
money is everything.â€

â€œYes,â€ murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; â€œand
when they grow older they know it. But I donâ€™t want money. It is only
people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay
mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly
upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoorâ€™s tradesmen, and
consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not
useful information, of course; useless information.â€

â€œWell, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,
although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in
the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in
now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure
humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite
enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for
him.â€

â€œMr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,â€ said
Lord Henry languidly.

â€œMr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?â€ asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy
white eyebrows.

â€œThat is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who
he is. He is the last Lord Kelsoâ€™s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,
Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What
was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in
your time, so you might have known her. I am very much interested in
Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.â€

â€œKelsoâ€™s grandson!â€ echoed the old gentleman. â€œKelsoâ€™s grandson! ... Of
course.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her
christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret
Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless
young fellowâ€”a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or
something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it
happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few
months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said
Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his
son-in-law in publicâ€”paid him, sir, to do it, paid himâ€”and that the
fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed
up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time
afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she
never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl
died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had
forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he
must be a good-looking chap.â€

â€œHe is very good-looking,â€ assented Lord Henry.

â€œI hope he will fall into proper hands,â€ continued the old man. â€œHe
should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing
by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,
through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a
mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I
was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble
who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made
quite a story of it. I didnâ€™t dare show my face at Court for a month. I
hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ answered Lord Henry. â€œI fancy that the boy will be well
off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so. And ...
his mother was very beautiful?â€

â€œMargaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,
Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could
understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was
mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family
were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.
Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at
him, and there wasnâ€™t a girl in London at the time who wasnâ€™t after
him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this
humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an
American? Ainâ€™t English girls good enough for him?â€

â€œIt is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.â€

â€œIâ€™ll back English women against the world, Harry,â€ said Lord Fermor,
striking the table with his fist.

â€œThe betting is on the Americans.â€

â€œThey donâ€™t last, I am told,â€ muttered his uncle.

â€œA long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a
steeplechase. They take things flying. I donâ€™t think Dartmoor has a
chance.â€

â€œWho are her people?â€ grumbled the old gentleman. â€œHas she got any?â€

Lord Henry shook his head. â€œAmerican girls are as clever at concealing
their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,â€ he said,
rising to go.

â€œThey are pork-packers, I suppose?â€

â€œI hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoorâ€™s sake. I am told that
pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after
politics.â€

â€œIs she pretty?â€

â€œShe behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the
secret of their charm.â€

â€œWhy canâ€™t these American women stay in their own country? They are
always telling us that it is the paradise for women.â€

â€œIt is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively
anxious to get out of it,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œGood-bye, Uncle George. I
shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the
information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new
friends, and nothing about my old ones.â€

â€œWhere are you lunching, Harry?â€

â€œAt Aunt Agathaâ€™s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her latest
_protÃ©gÃ©_.â€

â€œHumph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with
her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that
I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.â€

â€œAll right, Uncle George, Iâ€™ll tell her, but it wonâ€™t have any effect.
Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their
distinguishing characteristic.â€

The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his
servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and
turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.

So that was the story of Dorian Grayâ€™s parentage. Crudely as it had
been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a
strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything
for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a
hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child
born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to
solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an
interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it
were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something
tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might
blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as
with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat
opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer
rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing
upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the
bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of
influence. No other activity was like it. To project oneâ€™s soul into
some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear oneâ€™s
own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of
passion and youth; to convey oneâ€™s temperament into another as though
it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in
thatâ€”perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited
and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and
grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,
whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basilâ€™s studio, or could be
fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the
white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for
us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made
a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to
fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how
interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at
life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who
was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim
woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,
Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there
had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful
things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it
were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they
were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose
shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something
like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had
first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the
coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was
strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without
knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful
portrait. He would seek to dominate himâ€”had already, indeed, half done
so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something
fascinating in this son of love and death.

Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had
passed his auntâ€™s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.
When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they
had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and
passed into the dining-room.

â€œLate as usual, Harry,â€ cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.

He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to
her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from
the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.
Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and
good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample
architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are
described by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on
her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who
followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the
best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in
accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left was
occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable
charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,
having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he
had to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,
one of his auntâ€™s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so
dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.
Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most
intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement
in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely
earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once
himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of
them ever quite escape.

â€œWe are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,â€ cried the duchess,
nodding pleasantly to him across the table. â€œDo you think he will
really marry this fascinating young person?â€

â€œI believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.â€

â€œHow dreadful!â€ exclaimed Lady Agatha. â€œReally, some one should
interfere.â€

â€œI am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American
dry-goods store,â€ said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.

â€œMy uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.â€

â€œDry-goods! What are American dry-goods?â€ asked the duchess, raising
her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.

â€œAmerican novels,â€ answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.

The duchess looked puzzled.

â€œDonâ€™t mind him, my dear,â€ whispered Lady Agatha. â€œHe never means
anything that he says.â€

â€œWhen America was discovered,â€ said the Radical memberâ€”and he began to
give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a
subject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised
her privilege of interruption. â€œI wish to goodness it never had been
discovered at all!â€ she exclaimed. â€œReally, our girls have no chance
nowadays. It is most unfair.â€

â€œPerhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,â€ said Mr.
Erskine; â€œI myself would say that it had merely been detected.â€

â€œOh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,â€ answered the
duchess vaguely. â€œI must confess that most of them are extremely
pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.
I wish I could afford to do the same.â€

â€œThey say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,â€ chuckled Sir
Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humourâ€™s cast-off clothes.

â€œReally! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?â€ inquired the
duchess.

â€œThey go to America,â€ murmured Lord Henry.

Sir Thomas frowned. â€œI am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against
that great country,â€ he said to Lady Agatha. â€œI have travelled all over
it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are
extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.â€

â€œBut must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?â€ asked Mr.
Erskine plaintively. â€œI donâ€™t feel up to the journey.â€

Sir Thomas waved his hand. â€œMr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on
his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about
them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are
absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing
characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I
assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.â€

â€œHow dreadful!â€ cried Lord Henry. â€œI can stand brute force, but brute
reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It
is hitting below the intellect.â€

â€œI do not understand you,â€ said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.

â€œI do, Lord Henry,â€ murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.

â€œParadoxes are all very well in their way....â€ rejoined the baronet.

â€œWas that a paradox?â€ asked Mr. Erskine. â€œI did not think so. Perhaps
it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality
we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we
can judge them.â€

â€œDear me!â€ said Lady Agatha, â€œhow you men argue! I am sure I never can
make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with
you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the
East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love
his playing.â€

â€œI want him to play to me,â€ cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked
down the table and caught a bright answering glance.

â€œBut they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,â€ continued Lady Agatha.

â€œI can sympathize with everything except suffering,â€ said Lord Henry,
shrugging his shoulders. â€œI cannot sympathize with that. It is too
ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid
in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the
colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about lifeâ€™s sores,
the better.â€

â€œStill, the East End is a very important problem,â€ remarked Sir Thomas
with a grave shake of the head.

â€œQuite so,â€ answered the young lord. â€œIt is the problem of slavery, and
we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.â€

The politician looked at him keenly. â€œWhat change do you propose,
then?â€ he asked.

Lord Henry laughed. â€œI donâ€™t desire to change anything in England
except the weather,â€ he answered. â€œI am quite content with philosophic
contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through
an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal
to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that
they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not
emotional.â€

â€œBut we have such grave responsibilities,â€ ventured Mrs. Vandeleur
timidly.

â€œTerribly grave,â€ echoed Lady Agatha.

Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. â€œHumanity takes itself too
seriously. It is the worldâ€™s original sin. If the caveman had known how
to laugh, history would have been different.â€

â€œYou are really very comforting,â€ warbled the duchess. â€œI have always
felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no
interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look
her in the face without a blush.â€

â€œA blush is very becoming, Duchess,â€ remarked Lord Henry.

â€œOnly when one is young,â€ she answered. â€œWhen an old woman like myself
blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell
me how to become young again.â€

He thought for a moment. â€œCan you remember any great error that you
committed in your early days, Duchess?â€ he asked, looking at her across
the table.

â€œA great many, I fear,â€ she cried.

â€œThen commit them over again,â€ he said gravely. â€œTo get back oneâ€™s
youth, one has merely to repeat oneâ€™s follies.â€

â€œA delightful theory!â€ she exclaimed. â€œI must put it into practice.â€

â€œA dangerous theory!â€ came from Sir Thomasâ€™s tight lips. Lady Agatha
shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.

â€œYes,â€ he continued, â€œthat is one of the great secrets of life.
Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and
discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are
oneâ€™s mistakes.â€

A laugh ran round the table.

He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and
transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent
with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went
on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and
catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her
wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the
hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled
before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge
press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round
her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over
the vatâ€™s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary
improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,
and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose
temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and
to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic,
irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they
followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,
but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips
and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.

At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room
in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was
waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. â€œHow annoying!â€ she
cried. â€œI must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take
him to some absurd meeting at Willisâ€™s Rooms, where he is going to be
in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldnâ€™t
have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would
ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are
quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I donâ€™t know
what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some
night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?â€

â€œFor you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,â€ said Lord Henry with a
bow.

â€œAh! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,â€ she cried; â€œso mind you
comeâ€; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the
other ladies.

When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking
a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.

â€œYou talk books away,â€ he said; â€œwhy donâ€™t you write one?â€

â€œI am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I
should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely
as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in
England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of
all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty
of literature.â€

â€œI fear you are right,â€ answered Mr. Erskine. â€œI myself used to have
literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young
friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really
meant all that you said to us at lunch?â€

â€œI quite forget what I said,â€ smiled Lord Henry. â€œWas it all very bad?â€

â€œVery bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if
anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being
primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life. The
generation into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are
tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your
philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate
enough to possess.â€

â€œI shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It
has a perfect host, and a perfect library.â€

â€œYou will complete it,â€ answered the old gentleman with a courteous
bow. â€œAnd now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at
the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.â€

â€œAll of you, Mr. Erskine?â€

â€œForty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English
Academy of Letters.â€

Lord Henry laughed and rose. â€œI am going to the park,â€ he cried.

As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.
â€œLet me come with you,â€ he murmured.

â€œBut I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,â€
answered Lord Henry.

â€œI would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let
me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so
wonderfully as you do.â€

â€œAh! I have talked quite enough for to-day,â€ said Lord Henry, smiling.
â€œAll I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with
me, if you care to.â€




CHAPTER IV.


One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious
arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henryâ€™s house in Mayfair. It
was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled
wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling
of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,
long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette
by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for
Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies
that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and
parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small
leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a
summer day in London.

Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his
principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was
looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages
of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had
found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the
Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going
away.

At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. â€œHow late you
are, Harry!â€ he murmured.

â€œI am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,â€ answered a shrill voice.

He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. â€œI beg your pardon. I
thoughtâ€”â€

â€œYou thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me
introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my
husband has got seventeen of them.â€

â€œNot seventeen, Lady Henry?â€

â€œWell, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the
opera.â€ She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her
vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always
looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.
She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never
returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look
picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria,
and she had a perfect mania for going to church.

â€œThat was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?â€

â€œYes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagnerâ€™s music better than
anybodyâ€™s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other
people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, donâ€™t you
think so, Mr. Gray?â€

The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her
fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.

Dorian smiled and shook his head: â€œI am afraid I donâ€™t think so, Lady
Henry. I never talk during musicâ€”at least, during good music. If one
hears bad music, it is oneâ€™s duty to drown it in conversation.â€

â€œAh! that is one of Harryâ€™s views, isnâ€™t it, Mr. Gray? I always hear
Harryâ€™s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of
them. But you must not think I donâ€™t like good music. I adore it, but I
am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped
pianistsâ€”two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I donâ€™t know what it
is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,
ainâ€™t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after
a time, donâ€™t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to
art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesnâ€™t it? You have never been to
any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I canâ€™t afford
orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make oneâ€™s rooms
look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for
you, to ask you somethingâ€”I forget what it wasâ€”and I found Mr. Gray
here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the
same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been
most pleasant. I am so glad Iâ€™ve seen him.â€

â€œI am charmed, my love, quite charmed,â€ said Lord Henry, elevating his
dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused
smile. â€œSo sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old
brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays
people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.â€

â€œI am afraid I must be going,â€ exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an
awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. â€œI have promised to drive
with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining
out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornburyâ€™s.â€

â€œI dare say, my dear,â€ said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her
as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the
rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of
frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the
sofa.

â€œNever marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,â€ he said after a
few puffs.

â€œWhy, Harry?â€

â€œBecause they are so sentimental.â€

â€œBut I like sentimental people.â€

â€œNever marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,
because they are curious: both are disappointed.â€

â€œI donâ€™t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That
is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do
everything that you say.â€

â€œWho are you in love with?â€ asked Lord Henry after a pause.

â€œWith an actress,â€ said Dorian Gray, blushing.

Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. â€œThat is a rather commonplace
_dÃ©but_.â€

â€œYou would not say so if you saw her, Harry.â€

â€œWho is she?â€

â€œHer name is Sibyl Vane.â€

â€œNever heard of her.â€

â€œNo one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.â€

â€œMy dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They
never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent
the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of
mind over morals.â€

â€œHarry, how can you?â€

â€œMy dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so
I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I
find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and
the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a
reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to
supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake,
however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers
painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used
to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten
years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for
conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and
two of these canâ€™t be admitted into decent society. However, tell me
about your genius. How long have you known her?â€

â€œAh! Harry, your views terrify me.â€

â€œNever mind that. How long have you known her?â€

â€œAbout three weeks.â€

â€œAnd where did you come across her?â€

â€œI will tell you, Harry, but you mustnâ€™t be unsympathetic about it.
After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You
filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days
after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in
the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who
passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they
led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There
was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations....
Well, one evening about seven oâ€™clock, I determined to go out in search
of some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with
its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as
you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied a
thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I
remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we
first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret
of life. I donâ€™t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered
eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black
grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little
theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous
Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was
standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets,
and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. â€˜Have a
box, my Lord?â€™ he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an
air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that
amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I
really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the
present day I canâ€™t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadnâ€™tâ€”my dear
Harry, if I hadnâ€™tâ€”I should have missed the greatest romance of my
life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!â€

â€œI am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you
should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the
first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will
always be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of
people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes
of a country. Donâ€™t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for
you. This is merely the beginning.â€

â€œDo you think my nature so shallow?â€ cried Dorian Gray angrily.

â€œNo; I think your nature so deep.â€

â€œHow do you mean?â€

â€œMy dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really
the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I
call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.
Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life
of the intellectâ€”simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must
analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many
things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might
pick them up. But I donâ€™t want to interrupt you. Go on with your
story.â€

â€œWell, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a
vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the
curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and
cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were
fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and
there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the
dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there
was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.â€

â€œIt must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.â€

â€œJust like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what
on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you
think the play was, Harry?â€

â€œI should think â€˜The Idiot Boyâ€™, or â€˜Dumb but Innocentâ€™. Our fathers
used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,
the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is
not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandpÃ¨res ont
toujours tort_.â€

â€œThis play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I
must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare
done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a
sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There
was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a
cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene
was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,
with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a
beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the
low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most
friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the
scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But
Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a
little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of
dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were
like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen
in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that
beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,
Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came
across me. And her voiceâ€”I never heard such a voice. It was very low at
first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon oneâ€™s
ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a
distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy
that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There
were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You
know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane
are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear
them, and each of them says something different. I donâ€™t know which to
follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is
everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One
evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have
seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from
her loverâ€™s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of
Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.
She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and
given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been
innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike
throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary
women never appeal to oneâ€™s imagination. They are limited to their
century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as
easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is
no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and
chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped
smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an
actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didnâ€™t you tell me
that the only thing worth loving is an actress?â€

â€œBecause I have loved so many of them, Dorian.â€

â€œOh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.â€

â€œDonâ€™t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary
charm in them, sometimes,â€ said Lord Henry.

â€œI wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.â€

â€œYou could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life
you will tell me everything you do.â€

â€œYes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.
You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would
come and confess it to you. You would understand me.â€

â€œPeople like youâ€”the wilful sunbeams of lifeâ€”donâ€™t commit crimes,
Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now
tell meâ€”reach me the matches, like a good boyâ€”thanksâ€”what are your
actual relations with Sibyl Vane?â€

Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.
â€œHarry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!â€

â€œIt is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,â€ said
Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. â€œBut why
should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When
one is in love, one always begins by deceiving oneâ€™s self, and one
always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a
romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?â€

â€œOf course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the
horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and
offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was
furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds
of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I
think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the
impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.â€

â€œI am not surprised.â€

â€œThen he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I
never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and
confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy
against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.â€

â€œI should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other
hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all
expensive.â€

â€œWell, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,â€ laughed Dorian.
â€œBy this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,
and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly
recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the
place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I
was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though
he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with
an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to â€˜The
Bard,â€™ as he insisted on calling him. He seemed to think it a
distinction.â€

â€œIt was a distinction, my dear Dorianâ€”a great distinction. Most people
become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of
life. To have ruined oneâ€™s self over poetry is an honour. But when did
you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?â€

â€œThe third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going
round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at meâ€”at least
I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed
determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not
wanting to know her, wasnâ€™t it?â€

â€œNo; I donâ€™t think so.â€

â€œMy dear Harry, why?â€

â€œI will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.â€

â€œSibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child
about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her
what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of
her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood
grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate
speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like
children. He would insist on calling me â€˜My Lord,â€™ so I had to assure
Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me,
â€˜You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince Charming.â€™â€

â€œUpon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in
a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded
tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta
dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen
better days.â€

â€œI know that look. It depresses me,â€ murmured Lord Henry, examining his
rings.

â€œThe Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest
me.â€

â€œYou were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about
other peopleâ€™s tragedies.â€

â€œSibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came
from? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and
entirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every
night she is more marvellous.â€

â€œThat is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I
thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is
not quite what I expected.â€

â€œMy dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have
been to the opera with you several times,â€ said Dorian, opening his
blue eyes in wonder.

â€œYou always come dreadfully late.â€

â€œWell, I canâ€™t help going to see Sibyl play,â€ he cried, â€œeven if it is
only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think
of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I
am filled with awe.â€

â€œYou can dine with me to-night, Dorian, canâ€™t you?â€

He shook his head. â€œTo-night she is Imogen,â€ he answered, â€œand
to-morrow night she will be Juliet.â€

â€œWhen is she Sibyl Vane?â€

â€œNever.â€

â€œI congratulate you.â€

â€œHow horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one.
She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has
genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the
secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to
make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our
laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their
dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry,
how I worship her!â€ He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.
Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited.

Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different
he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallwardâ€™s
studio! His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of
scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and
desire had come to meet it on the way.

â€œAnd what do you propose to do?â€ said Lord Henry at last.

â€œI want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I
have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to
acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jewâ€™s hands.
She is bound to him for three yearsâ€”at least for two years and eight
monthsâ€”from the present time. I shall have to pay him something, of
course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and
bring her out properly. She will make the world as mad as she has made
me.â€

â€œThat would be impossible, my dear boy.â€

â€œYes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in
her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it
is personalities, not principles, that move the age.â€

â€œWell, what night shall we go?â€

â€œLet me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet
to-morrow.â€

â€œAll right. The Bristol at eight oâ€™clock; and I will get Basil.â€

â€œNot eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the
curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets
Romeo.â€

â€œHalf-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or
reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before
seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to
him?â€

â€œDear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather
horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful
frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous
of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit
that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him. I donâ€™t want
to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good
advice.â€

Lord Henry smiled. â€œPeople are very fond of giving away what they need
most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.â€

â€œOh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit
of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered
that.â€

â€œBasil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his
work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his
prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I
have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good
artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly
uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is
the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely
fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they
look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets
makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot
write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.â€

â€œI wonder is that really so, Harry?â€ said Dorian Gray, putting some
perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that
stood on the table. â€œIt must be, if you say it. And now I am off.
Imogen is waiting for me. Donâ€™t forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.â€

As he left the room, Lord Henryâ€™s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began
to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as
Dorian Gray, and yet the ladâ€™s mad adoration of some one else caused
him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by
it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled
by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of
that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had
begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.
Human lifeâ€”that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.
Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as
one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one
could not wear over oneâ€™s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous
fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with
monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle
that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were
maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to
understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received!
How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard
logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellectâ€”to
observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they
were in unison, and at what point they were at discordâ€”there was a
delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too
high a price for any sensation.

He was consciousâ€”and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his
brown agate eyesâ€”that it was through certain words of his, musical
words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Grayâ€™s soul had turned
to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent
the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was
something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its
secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were
revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect
of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately
with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex
personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,
in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,
just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.

Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was
yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was
becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his
beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It
was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one
of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be
remote from one, but whose sorrows stir oneâ€™s sense of beauty, and
whose wounds are like red roses.

Soul and body, body and soulâ€”how mysterious they were! There was
animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.
The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say
where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How
shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And
yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!
Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body
really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit
from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a
mystery also.

He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a
science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it
was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.
Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to
their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of
warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation
of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow
and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in
experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.
All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same
as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we
would do many times, and with joy.

It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by
which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and
certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to
promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane
was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt
that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new
experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex
passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of
boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,
changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from
sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the
passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most
strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we
were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were
experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.

While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the
door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for
dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had
smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The
panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a
faded rose. He thought of his friendâ€™s young fiery-coloured life and
wondered how it was all going to end.

When he arrived home, about half-past twelve oâ€™clock, he saw a telegram
lying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian
Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl
Vane.




CHAPTER V.


â€œMother, Mother, I am so happy!â€ whispered the girl, burying her face
in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to
the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their
dingy sitting-room contained. â€œI am so happy!â€ she repeated, â€œand you
must be happy, too!â€

Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her
daughterâ€™s head. â€œHappy!â€ she echoed, â€œI am only happy, Sibyl, when I
see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr. Isaacs
has been very good to us, and we owe him money.â€

The girl looked up and pouted. â€œMoney, Mother?â€ she cried, â€œwhat does
money matter? Love is more than money.â€

â€œMr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to
get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty
pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.â€

â€œHe is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,â€
said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.

â€œI donâ€™t know how we could manage without him,â€ answered the elder
woman querulously.

Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. â€œWe donâ€™t want him any more,
Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.â€ Then she paused. A rose
shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breath parted the
petals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept
over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. â€œI love him,â€ she
said simply.

â€œFoolish child! foolish child!â€ was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.
The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the
words.

The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her
eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a
moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a
dream had passed across them.

Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at
prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name
of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of
passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on
memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it
had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids
were warm with his breath.

Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This
young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against
the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of
craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.

Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.
â€œMother, Mother,â€ she cried, â€œwhy does he love me so much? I know why I
love him. I love him because he is like what love himself should be.
But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yetâ€”why, I
cannot tellâ€”though I feel so much beneath him, I donâ€™t feel humble. I
feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love
Prince Charming?â€

The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her
cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to
her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. â€œForgive me,
Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains
you because you loved him so much. Donâ€™t look so sad. I am as happy
to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!â€

â€œMy child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,
what do you know of this young man? You donâ€™t even know his name. The
whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away
to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you
should have shown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he
is rich ...â€

â€œAh! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!â€

Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical
gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a
stage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment, the door opened
and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He was
thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat
clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would
hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.
Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. She mentally
elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the
_tableau_ was interesting.

â€œYou might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,â€ said the
lad with a good-natured grumble.

â€œAh! but you donâ€™t like being kissed, Jim,â€ she cried. â€œYou are a
dreadful old bear.â€ And she ran across the room and hugged him.

James Vane looked into his sisterâ€™s face with tenderness. â€œI want you
to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I donâ€™t suppose I shall ever see
this horrid London again. I am sure I donâ€™t want to.â€

â€œMy son, donâ€™t say such dreadful things,â€ murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up
a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She
felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would
have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.

â€œWhy not, Mother? I mean it.â€

â€œYou pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a
position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the
Coloniesâ€”nothing that I would call societyâ€”so when you have made your
fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.â€

â€œSociety!â€ muttered the lad. â€œI donâ€™t want to know anything about that.
I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I
hate it.â€

â€œOh, Jim!â€ said Sibyl, laughing, â€œhow unkind of you! But are you really
going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were
going to say good-bye to some of your friendsâ€”to Tom Hardy, who gave
you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking
it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where
shall we go? Let us go to the park.â€

â€œI am too shabby,â€ he answered, frowning. â€œOnly swell people go to the
park.â€

â€œNonsense, Jim,â€ she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.

He hesitated for a moment. â€œVery well,â€ he said at last, â€œbut donâ€™t be
too long dressing.â€ She danced out of the door. One could hear her
singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.

He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to
the still figure in the chair. â€œMother, are my things ready?â€ he asked.

â€œQuite ready, James,â€ she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For
some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this
rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when
their eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The
silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.
She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as
they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. â€œI hope you will be
contented, James, with your sea-faring life,â€ she said. â€œYou must
remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a
solicitorâ€™s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the
country often dine with the best families.â€

â€œI hate offices, and I hate clerks,â€ he replied. â€œBut you are quite
right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Donâ€™t
let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.â€

â€œJames, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.â€

â€œI hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to
talk to her. Is that right? What about that?â€

â€œYou are speaking about things you donâ€™t understand, James. In the
profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying
attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was
when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at
present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt
that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always
most polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and
the flowers he sends are lovely.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t know his name, though,â€ said the lad harshly.

â€œNo,â€ answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. â€œHe has
not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He
is probably a member of the aristocracy.â€

James Vane bit his lip. â€œWatch over Sibyl, Mother,â€ he cried, â€œwatch
over her.â€

â€œMy son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special
care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why
she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the
aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a
most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.
His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.â€

The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane
with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when
the door opened and Sibyl ran in.

â€œHow serious you both are!â€ she cried. â€œWhat is the matter?â€

â€œNothing,â€ he answered. â€œI suppose one must be serious sometimes.
Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five oâ€™clock. Everything is
packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.â€

â€œGood-bye, my son,â€ she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.

She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and
there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.

â€œKiss me, Mother,â€ said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the
withered cheek and warmed its frost.

â€œMy child! my child!â€ cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in
search of an imaginary gallery.

â€œCome, Sibyl,â€ said her brother impatiently. He hated his motherâ€™s
affectations.

They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled
down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the
sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the
company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He was like a common
gardener walking with a rose.

Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of
some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on
geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however,
was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was
trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming,
and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,
but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about
the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life
he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not
to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.
Oh, no! A sailorâ€™s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a
horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a
black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long
screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a
polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.
Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure
gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it
down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The
bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with
immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.
They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other
in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,
and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful
heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase,
and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with
her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense
house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.
But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money
foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much
more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and
to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very
good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a
few years he would come back quite rich and happy.

The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick
at leaving home.

Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.
Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger
of Sibylâ€™s position. This young dandy who was making love to her could
mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated
him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,
and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was
conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his motherâ€™s nature,
and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibylâ€™s happiness.
Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge
them; sometimes they forgive them.

His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that
he had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he
had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears
one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of
horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a
hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge-like
furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.

â€œYou are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,â€ cried Sibyl, â€œand I
am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.â€

â€œWhat do you want me to say?â€

â€œOh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,â€ she answered,
smiling at him.

He shrugged his shoulders. â€œYou are more likely to forget me than I am
to forget you, Sibyl.â€

She flushed. â€œWhat do you mean, Jim?â€ she asked.

â€œYou have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me
about him? He means you no good.â€

â€œStop, Jim!â€ she exclaimed. â€œYou must not say anything against him. I
love him.â€

â€œWhy, you donâ€™t even know his name,â€ answered the lad. â€œWho is he? I
have a right to know.â€

â€œHe is called Prince Charming. Donâ€™t you like the name? Oh! you silly
boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think
him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet
himâ€”when you come back from Australia. You will like him so much.
Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the
theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh!
how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have
him sitting there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten
the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass
oneâ€™s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting â€˜geniusâ€™ to his
loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will
announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only,
Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor
beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the
door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.
They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I
think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.â€

â€œHe is a gentleman,â€ said the lad sullenly.

â€œA prince!â€ she cried musically. â€œWhat more do you want?â€

â€œHe wants to enslave you.â€

â€œI shudder at the thought of being free.â€

â€œI want you to beware of him.â€

â€œTo see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.â€

â€œSibyl, you are mad about him.â€

She laughed and took his arm. â€œYou dear old Jim, you talk as if you
were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will
know what it is. Donâ€™t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to
think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have
ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and
difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world,
and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the
smart people go by.â€

They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across
the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dustâ€”tremulous
cloud of orris-root it seemedâ€”hung in the panting air. The brightly
coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.

She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He
spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as
players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not
communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all
the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she
caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open
carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.

She started to her feet. â€œThere he is!â€ she cried.

â€œWho?â€ said Jim Vane.

â€œPrince Charming,â€ she answered, looking after the victoria.

He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. â€œShow him to me. Which
is he? Point him out. I must see him!â€ he exclaimed; but at that moment
the Duke of Berwickâ€™s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left
the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.

â€œHe is gone,â€ murmured Sibyl sadly. â€œI wish you had seen him.â€

â€œI wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does
you any wrong, I shall kill him.â€

She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air
like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to
her tittered.

â€œCome away, Jim; come away,â€ she whispered. He followed her doggedly as
she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.

When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity
in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at
him. â€œYou are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that
is all. How can you say such horrible things? You donâ€™t know what you
are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you
would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said was
wicked.â€

â€œI am sixteen,â€ he answered, â€œand I know what I am about. Mother is no
help to you. She doesnâ€™t understand how to look after you. I wish now
that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck
the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadnâ€™t been signed.â€

â€œOh, donâ€™t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those
silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going
to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect
happiness. We wonâ€™t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I
love, would you?â€

â€œNot as long as you love him, I suppose,â€ was the sullen answer.

â€œI shall love him for ever!â€ she cried.

â€œAnd he?â€

â€œFor ever, too!â€

â€œHe had better.â€

She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He
was merely a boy.

At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to
their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five oâ€™clock, and
Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted
that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with her when
their mother was not present. She would be sure to make a scene, and he
detested scenes of every kind.

In Sybilâ€™s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the ladâ€™s heart,
and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,
had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck,
and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her
with real affection. There were tears in his eyes as he went
downstairs.

His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his
unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his
meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the
stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of
street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that
was left to him.

After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his
hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to
him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother
watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace
handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got
up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their
eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.

â€œMother, I have something to ask you,â€ he said. Her eyes wandered
vaguely about the room. She made no answer. â€œTell me the truth. I have
a right to know. Were you married to my father?â€

She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,
the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,
had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure
it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question
called for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led up
to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.

â€œNo,â€ she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.

â€œMy father was a scoundrel then!â€ cried the lad, clenching his fists.

She shook her head. â€œI knew he was not free. We loved each other very
much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Donâ€™t speak
against him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he
was highly connected.â€

An oath broke from his lips. â€œI donâ€™t care for myself,â€ he exclaimed,
â€œbut donâ€™t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isnâ€™t it, who is in love
with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.â€

For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her
head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. â€œSibyl has a
mother,â€ she murmured; â€œI had none.â€

The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed
her. â€œI am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,â€ he
said, â€œbut I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Donâ€™t forget
that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me
that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him
down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it.â€

The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that
accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid
to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely,
and for the first time for many months she really admired her son. She
would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional
scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers
looked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the
bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It
was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the
tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She
was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled
herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now
that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase.
It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and
dramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some
day.




CHAPTER VI.


â€œI suppose you have heard the news, Basil?â€ said Lord Henry that
evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol
where dinner had been laid for three.

â€œNo, Harry,â€ answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing
waiter. â€œWhat is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They donâ€™t
interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons
worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little
whitewashing.â€

â€œDorian Gray is engaged to be married,â€ said Lord Henry, watching him
as he spoke.

Hallward started and then frowned. â€œDorian engaged to be married!â€ he
cried. â€œImpossible!â€

â€œIt is perfectly true.â€

â€œTo whom?â€

â€œTo some little actress or other.â€

â€œI canâ€™t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.â€

â€œDorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear
Basil.â€

â€œMarriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.â€

â€œExcept in America,â€ rejoined Lord Henry languidly. â€œBut I didnâ€™t say
he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great
difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have
no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I
never was engaged.â€

â€œBut think of Dorianâ€™s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be
absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.â€

â€œIf you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is
sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it
is always from the noblest motives.â€

â€œI hope the girl is good, Harry. I donâ€™t want to see Dorian tied to
some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his
intellect.â€

â€œOh, she is better than goodâ€”she is beautiful,â€ murmured Lord Henry,
sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. â€œDorian says she is
beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your
portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal
appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst
others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesnâ€™t forget his
appointment.â€

â€œAre you serious?â€

â€œQuite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever
be more serious than I am at the present moment.â€

â€œBut do you approve of it, Harry?â€ asked the painter, walking up and
down the room and biting his lip. â€œYou canâ€™t approve of it, possibly.
It is some silly infatuation.â€

â€œI never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd
attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air
our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people
say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a
personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality
selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with
a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not?
If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know
I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that
it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack
individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage
makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other
egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more
highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the
object of manâ€™s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and
whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I
hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore
her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one
else. He would be a wonderful study.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you donâ€™t.
If Dorian Grayâ€™s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than
yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.â€

Lord Henry laughed. â€œThe reason we all like to think so well of others
is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer
terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour
with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to
us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find
good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our
pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest
contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but
one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have
merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,
but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I
will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being
fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I
can.â€

â€œMy dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!â€ said the
lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and
shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. â€œI have never been so
happy. Of course, it is suddenâ€”all really delightful things are. And
yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my
life.â€ He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked
extraordinarily handsome.

â€œI hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,â€ said Hallward, â€œbut I
donâ€™t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.
You let Harry know.â€

â€œAnd I donâ€™t forgive you for being late for dinner,â€ broke in Lord
Henry, putting his hand on the ladâ€™s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.
â€œCome, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and
then you will tell us how it all came about.â€

â€œThere is really not much to tell,â€ cried Dorian as they took their
seats at the small round table. â€œWhat happened was simply this. After I
left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that
little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and
went down at eight oâ€™clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.
Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!
You should have seen her! When she came on in her boyâ€™s clothes, she
was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with
cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little
green cap with a hawkâ€™s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak
lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had
all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your
studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round
a pale rose. As for her actingâ€”well, you shall see her to-night. She is
simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I
forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away
with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the
performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were
sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had
never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each
other. I canâ€™t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to
me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of
rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white
narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I
feel that I should not tell you all this, but I canâ€™t help it. Of
course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own
mother. I donâ€™t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to
be furious. I donâ€™t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and
then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, havenâ€™t I, to take
my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeareâ€™s plays? Lips
that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.
I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the
mouth.â€

â€œYes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,â€ said Hallward slowly.

â€œHave you seen her to-day?â€ asked Lord Henry.

Dorian Gray shook his head. â€œI left her in the forest of Arden; I shall
find her in an orchard in Verona.â€

Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. â€œAt what
particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what
did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.â€

â€œMy dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did
not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said
she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is
nothing to me compared with her.â€

â€œWomen are wonderfully practical,â€ murmured Lord Henry, â€œmuch more
practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to
say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.â€

Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. â€œDonâ€™t, Harry. You have annoyed
Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any
one. His nature is too fine for that.â€

Lord Henry looked across the table. â€œDorian is never annoyed with me,â€
he answered. â€œI asked the question for the best reason possible, for
the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any
questionâ€”simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women
who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of
course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not
modern.â€

Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. â€œYou are quite incorrigible,
Harry; but I donâ€™t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When
you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her
would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any
one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to
place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman
who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for
that. Ah! donâ€™t mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her
trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her,
I regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you
have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vaneâ€™s
hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous,
delightful theories.â€

â€œAnd those are ...?â€ asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.

â€œOh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories
about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.â€

â€œPleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,â€ he answered
in his slow melodious voice. â€œBut I am afraid I cannot claim my theory
as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Natureâ€™s test,
her sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when
we are good, we are not always happy.â€

â€œAh! but what do you mean by good?â€ cried Basil Hallward.

â€œYes,â€ echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord
Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the
centre of the table, â€œwhat do you mean by good, Harry?â€

â€œTo be good is to be in harmony with oneâ€™s self,â€ he replied, touching
the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.
â€œDiscord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. Oneâ€™s own
lifeâ€”that is the important thing. As for the lives of oneâ€™s neighbours,
if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt oneâ€™s moral
views about them, but they are not oneâ€™s concern. Besides,
individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in
accepting the standard of oneâ€™s age. I consider that for any man of
culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest
immorality.â€

â€œBut, surely, if one lives merely for oneâ€™s self, Harry, one pays a
terrible price for doing so?â€ suggested the painter.

â€œYes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that
the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but
self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege
of the rich.â€

â€œOne has to pay in other ways but money.â€

â€œWhat sort of ways, Basil?â€

â€œOh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the
consciousness of degradation.â€

Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. â€œMy dear fellow, mediÃ¦val art is
charming, but mediÃ¦val emotions are out of date. One can use them in
fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in
fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,
no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever
knows what a pleasure is.â€

â€œI know what pleasure is,â€ cried Dorian Gray. â€œIt is to adore some
one.â€

â€œThat is certainly better than being adored,â€ he answered, toying with
some fruits. â€œBeing adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as
humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us
to do something for them.â€

â€œI should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to
us,â€ murmured the lad gravely. â€œThey create love in our natures. They
have a right to demand it back.â€

â€œThat is quite true, Dorian,â€ cried Hallward.

â€œNothing is ever quite true,â€ said Lord Henry.

â€œThis is,â€ interrupted Dorian. â€œYou must admit, Harry, that women give
to men the very gold of their lives.â€

â€œPossibly,â€ he sighed, â€œbut they invariably want it back in such very
small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once
put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always
prevent us from carrying them out.â€

â€œHarry, you are dreadful! I donâ€™t know why I like you so much.â€

â€œYou will always like me, Dorian,â€ he replied. â€œWill you have some
coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and
some cigarettes. No, donâ€™t mind the cigarettesâ€”I have some. Basil, I
canâ€™t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette
is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it
leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will
always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never
had the courage to commit.â€

â€œWhat nonsense you talk, Harry!â€ cried the lad, taking a light from a
fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.
â€œLet us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will
have a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you
have never known.â€

â€œI have known everything,â€ said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his
eyes, â€œbut I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,
that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful
girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life.
Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but
there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a
hansom.â€

They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The
painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He
could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better
than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,
they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been
arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in
front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that
Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the
past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded
flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the
theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.




CHAPTER VII.


For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat
Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with
an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of
pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top
of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he
had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,
upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and
insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud
to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a
poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The
heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a
monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery
had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.
They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges
with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in
the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of
the popping of corks came from the bar.

â€œWhat a place to find oneâ€™s divinity in!â€ said Lord Henry.

â€œYes!â€ answered Dorian Gray. â€œIt was here I found her, and she is
divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget
everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and
brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They
sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to
do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them,
and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as oneâ€™s self.â€

â€œThe same flesh and blood as oneâ€™s self! Oh, I hope not!â€ exclaimed
Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his
opera-glass.

â€œDonâ€™t pay any attention to him, Dorian,â€ said the painter. â€œI
understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love
must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must
be fine and noble. To spiritualize oneâ€™s ageâ€”that is something worth
doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without
one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have
been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and
lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of
all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage
is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The
gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been
incomplete.â€

â€œThanks, Basil,â€ answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. â€œI knew that
you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here
is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about
five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom
I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is
good in me.â€

A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of
applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly
lovely to look atâ€”one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,
that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace
and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror
of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded
enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to
tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.
Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord
Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, â€œCharming! charming!â€

The scene was the hall of Capuletâ€™s house, and Romeo in his pilgrimâ€™s
dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such
as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through
the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a
creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a
plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a
white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.

Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes
rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speakâ€”

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrimsâ€™ hands do touch,
    And palm to palm is holy palmersâ€™ kissâ€”


with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly
artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view
of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away
all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.

Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.
Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them
to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.

Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of
the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was
nothing in her.

She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be
denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse
as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She
overemphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passageâ€”

Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-nightâ€”


was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been
taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she
leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful linesâ€”

Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say, â€œIt lightens.â€ Sweet, good-night!
This bud of love by summerâ€™s ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meetâ€”


she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was
not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely
self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.

Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their
interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and
to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the
dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was
the girl herself.

When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord
Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. â€œShe is quite
beautiful, Dorian,â€ he said, â€œbut she canâ€™t act. Let us go.â€

â€œI am going to see the play through,â€ answered the lad, in a hard
bitter voice. â€œI am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an
evening, Harry. I apologize to you both.â€

â€œMy dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,â€ interrupted
Hallward. â€œWe will come some other night.â€

â€œI wish she were ill,â€ he rejoined. â€œBut she seems to me to be simply
callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great
artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.â€

â€œDonâ€™t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more
wonderful thing than art.â€

â€œThey are both simply forms of imitation,â€ remarked Lord Henry. â€œBut do
let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good
for oneâ€™s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I donâ€™t suppose you will
want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like
a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about
life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.
There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinatingâ€”people
who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.
Good heavens, my dear boy, donâ€™t look so tragic! The secret of
remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to
the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to
the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?â€

â€œGo away, Harry,â€ cried the lad. â€œI want to be alone. Basil, you must
go. Ah! canâ€™t you see that my heart is breaking?â€ The hot tears came to
his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he
leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.

â€œLet us go, Basil,â€ said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his
voice, and the two young men passed out together.

A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose
on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale,
and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed
interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots
and laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played
to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some
groans.

As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the
greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on
her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a
radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of
their own.

When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy
came over her. â€œHow badly I acted to-night, Dorian!â€ she cried.

â€œHorribly!â€ he answered, gazing at her in amazement. â€œHorribly! It was
dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea
what I suffered.â€

The girl smiled. â€œDorian,â€ she answered, lingering over his name with
long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to
the red petals of her mouth. â€œDorian, you should have understood. But
you understand now, donâ€™t you?â€

â€œUnderstand what?â€ he asked, angrily.

â€œWhy I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall
never act well again.â€

He shrugged his shoulders. â€œYou are ill, I suppose. When you are ill
you shouldnâ€™t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored.
I was bored.â€

She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An
ecstasy of happiness dominated her.

â€œDorian, Dorian,â€ she cried, â€œbefore I knew you, acting was the one
reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought
that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.
The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine
also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me
seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew
nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You cameâ€”oh, my beautiful
love!â€”and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality
really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the
hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had
always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that
the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the
orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I
had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to
say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is
but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My
love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of
shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do
with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not
understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that
I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly
it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to
me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love
such as ours? Take me away, Dorianâ€”take me away with you, where we can
be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not
feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,
Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it
would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me
see that.â€

He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. â€œYou have
killed my love,â€ he muttered.

She looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came
across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt
down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a
shudder ran through him.

Then he leaped up and went to the door. â€œYes,â€ he cried, â€œyou have
killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you donâ€™t even
stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because
you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you
realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the
shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and
stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You
are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think
of you. I will never mention your name. You donâ€™t know what you were to
me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I canâ€™t bear to think of it! I wish I had
never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How
little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your
art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid,
magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have
borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty
face.â€

The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and
her voice seemed to catch in her throat. â€œYou are not serious, Dorian?â€
she murmured. â€œYou are acting.â€

â€œActing! I leave that to you. You do it so well,â€ he answered bitterly.

She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her
face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and
looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. â€œDonâ€™t touch me!â€ he cried.

A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay
there like a trampled flower. â€œDorian, Dorian, donâ€™t leave me!â€ she
whispered. â€œI am so sorry I didnâ€™t act well. I was thinking of you all
the time. But I will tryâ€”indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across
me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had
not kissed meâ€”if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.
Donâ€™t go away from me. I couldnâ€™t bear it. Oh! donâ€™t go away from me.
My brother ... No; never mind. He didnâ€™t mean it. He was in jest....
But you, oh! canâ€™t you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and
try to improve. Donâ€™t be cruel to me, because I love you better than
anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not
pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown
myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldnâ€™t help
it. Oh, donâ€™t leave me, donâ€™t leave me.â€ A fit of passionate sobbing
choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian
Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled
lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous
about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane
seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed
him.

â€œI am going,â€ he said at last in his calm clear voice. â€œI donâ€™t wish to
be unkind, but I canâ€™t see you again. You have disappointed me.â€

She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little
hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He
turned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of
the theatre.

Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly
lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking
houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after
him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like
monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps,
and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.

As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.
The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed
itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies
rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with
the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an
anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men
unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some
cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money
for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at
midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long
line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red
roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,
jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,
sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,
waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging
doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped
and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.
Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked
and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.

After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few
moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent
square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.
The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like
silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke
was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.

In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Dogeâ€™s barge, that
hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,
lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals
of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and,
having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library
towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the
ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had
decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries
that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As
he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait
Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.
Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he
had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.
Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In
the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk
blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression
looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty
in the mouth. It was certainly strange.

He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The
bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky
corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he
had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be
more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the
lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking
into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.

He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory
Cupids, one of Lord Henryâ€™s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly
into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What
did it mean?

He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it
again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual
painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had
altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly
apparent.

He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there
flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallwardâ€™s studio the
day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He
had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the
portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the
face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that
the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and
thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness
of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been
fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to
think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the
touch of cruelty in the mouth.

Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girlâ€™s fault, not his. He had
dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he
had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been
shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over
him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little
child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had
he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he
had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had
lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His
life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had
wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear
sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of
their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one
with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and
Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl
Vane? She was nothing to him now.

But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his
life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.
Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it
again?

No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The
horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly
there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men
mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.

Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel
smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met
his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted
image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would
alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses
would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and
wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or
unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would
resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any moreâ€”would not, at
any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil
Hallwardâ€™s garden had first stirred within him the passion for
impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,
marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She
must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish
and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would
return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be
beautiful and pure.

He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the
portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. â€œHow horrible!â€ he murmured
to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he
stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning
air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of
Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name
over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched
garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.




CHAPTER VIII.


It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times
on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered
what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and
Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a
small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains,
with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall
windows.

â€œMonsieur has well slept this morning,â€ he said, smiling.

â€œWhat oâ€™clock is it, Victor?â€ asked Dorian Gray drowsily.

â€œOne hour and a quarter, Monsieur.â€

How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his
letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand
that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The
others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of
cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of
charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young
men every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for
a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the
courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned
people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary
things are our only necessities; and there were several very
courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders
offering to advance any sum of money at a momentâ€™s notice and at the
most reasonable rates of interest.

After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate
dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the
onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.
He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense
of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice,
but there was the unreality of a dream about it.

As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a
light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round
table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air
seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the
blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before
him. He felt perfectly happy.

Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the
portrait, and he started.

â€œToo cold for Monsieur?â€ asked his valet, putting an omelette on the
table. â€œI shut the window?â€

Dorian shook his head. â€œI am not cold,â€ he murmured.

Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply
his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there
had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The
thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It
would make him smile.

And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in
the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of
cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the
room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the
portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes
had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to
tell him to remain. As the door was closing behind him, he called him
back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a
moment. â€œI am not at home to any one, Victor,â€ he said with a sigh. The
man bowed and retired.

Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on
a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen
was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a
rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously,
wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a manâ€™s life.

Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was
the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was
not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier
chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?
What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own
picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be
examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful
state of doubt.

He got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he
looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and
saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had
altered.

As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he
found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost
scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was
incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle
affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form
and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be
that what that soul thought, they realized?â€”that what it dreamed, they
made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered,
and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the
picture in sickened horror.

One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him
conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not
too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His
unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be
transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would
be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the
fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could
lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the
degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men
brought upon their souls.

Three oâ€™clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double
chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the
scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his
way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was
wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he
went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had
loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He
covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of
pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we
feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,
not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the
letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.

Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henryâ€™s
voice outside. â€œMy dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I canâ€™t
bear your shutting yourself up like this.â€

He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking
still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry
in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel
with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was
inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,
and unlocked the door.

â€œI am so sorry for it all, Dorian,â€ said Lord Henry as he entered. â€œBut
you must not think too much about it.â€

â€œDo you mean about Sibyl Vane?â€ asked the lad.

â€œYes, of course,â€ answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly
pulling off his yellow gloves. â€œIt is dreadful, from one point of view,
but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her,
after the play was over?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?â€

â€œI was brutal, Harryâ€”perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am
not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know
myself better.â€

â€œAh, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would
find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.â€

â€œI have got through all that,â€ said Dorian, shaking his head and
smiling. â€œI am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin
with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in
us. Donâ€™t sneer at it, Harry, any moreâ€”at least not before me. I want
to be good. I canâ€™t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.â€

â€œA very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you
on it. But how are you going to begin?â€

â€œBy marrying Sibyl Vane.â€

â€œMarrying Sibyl Vane!â€ cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him
in perplexed amazement. â€œBut, my dear Dorianâ€”â€

â€œYes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about
marriage. Donâ€™t say it. Donâ€™t ever say things of that kind to me again.
Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word
to her. She is to be my wife.â€

â€œYour wife! Dorian! ... Didnâ€™t you get my letter? I wrote to you this
morning, and sent the note down by my own man.â€

â€œYour letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was
afraid there might be something in it that I wouldnâ€™t like. You cut
life to pieces with your epigrams.â€

â€œYou know nothing then?â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€

Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,
took both his hands in his own and held them tightly. â€œDorian,â€ he
said, â€œmy letterâ€”donâ€™t be frightenedâ€”was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is
dead.â€

A cry of pain broke from the ladâ€™s lips, and he leaped to his feet,
tearing his hands away from Lord Henryâ€™s grasp. â€œDead! Sibyl dead! It
is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?â€

â€œIt is quite true, Dorian,â€ said Lord Henry, gravely. â€œIt is in all the
morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till
I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not
be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.
But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make
oneâ€™s _dÃ©but_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an
interest to oneâ€™s old age. I suppose they donâ€™t know your name at the
theatre? If they donâ€™t, it is all right. Did any one see you going
round to her room? That is an important point.â€

Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.
Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, â€œHarry, did you say an
inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibylâ€”? Oh, Harry, I canâ€™t bear
it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.â€

â€œI have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put
in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre
with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had
forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she
did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the
floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake,
some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I donâ€™t know what it was, but
it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was
prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.â€

â€œHarry, Harry, it is terrible!â€ cried the lad.

â€œYes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed
up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have
thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and
seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustnâ€™t let this
thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and
afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and
everybody will be there. You can come to my sisterâ€™s box. She has got
some smart women with her.â€

â€œSo I have murdered Sibyl Vane,â€ said Dorian Gray, half to himself,
â€œmurdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.
Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as
happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go
on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How
extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,
Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has
happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.
Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my
life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been
addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent
people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh,
Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was
everything to me. Then came that dreadful nightâ€”was it really only last
night?â€”when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She
explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a
bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me
afraid. I canâ€™t tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I
would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My
God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You donâ€™t know the danger I am in,
and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for
me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.â€

â€œMy dear Dorian,â€ answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case
and producing a gold-latten matchbox, â€œthe only way a woman can ever
reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible
interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been
wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always
be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon
found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman
finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy,
or wears very smart bonnets that some other womanâ€™s husband has to pay
for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been
abjectâ€”which, of course, I would not have allowedâ€”but I assure you that
in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.â€

â€œI suppose it would,â€ muttered the lad, walking up and down the room
and looking horribly pale. â€œBut I thought it was my duty. It is not my
fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.
I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good
resolutionsâ€”that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.â€

â€œGood resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific
laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.
They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions
that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said
for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they
have no account.â€

â€œHarry,â€ cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,
â€œwhy is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I
donâ€™t think I am heartless. Do you?â€

â€œYou have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be
entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,â€ answered Lord Henry with
his sweet melancholy smile.

The lad frowned. â€œI donâ€™t like that explanation, Harry,â€ he rejoined,
â€œbut I am glad you donâ€™t think I am heartless. I am nothing of the
kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has
happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply
like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible
beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but
by which I have not been wounded.â€

â€œIt is an interesting question,â€ said Lord Henry, who found an
exquisite pleasure in playing on the ladâ€™s unconscious egotism, â€œan
extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is
this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an
inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their
absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack
of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an
impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes,
however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses
our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply
appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are
no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are
both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle
enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened?
Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had
such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the
rest of my life. The people who have adored meâ€”there have not been very
many, but there have been someâ€”have always insisted on living on, long
after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have
become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for
reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is!
And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb
the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details
are always vulgar.â€

â€œI must sow poppies in my garden,â€ sighed Dorian.

â€œThere is no necessity,â€ rejoined his companion. â€œLife has always
poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once
wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic
mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did
die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice
the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one
with the terror of eternity. Wellâ€”would you believe it?â€”a week ago, at
Lady Hampshireâ€™s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in
question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and
digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance
in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I
had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous
dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she
showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women
never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act,
and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose
to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would
have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.
They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are
more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the
women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.
Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going
in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve,
whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of
pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a
great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their
husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in oneâ€™s face, as if it
were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its
mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and
I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being
told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes;
there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern
life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.â€

â€œWhat is that, Harry?â€ said the lad listlessly.

â€œOh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one elseâ€™s admirer when one
loses oneâ€™s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But
really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the
women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her
death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.
They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,
such as romance, passion, and love.â€

â€œI was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.â€

â€œI am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more
than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have
emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all
the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I
have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how
delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day
before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful,
but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to
everything.â€

â€œWhat was that, Harry?â€

â€œYou said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of
romanceâ€”that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that
if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.â€

â€œShe will never come to life again now,â€ muttered the lad, burying his
face in his hands.

â€œNo, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you
must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a
strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene
from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived,
and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a
dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeareâ€™s plays and left them
lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeareâ€™s music
sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual
life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn
for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was
strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio
died. But donâ€™t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real
than they are.â€

There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and
with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours
faded wearily out of things.

After some time Dorian Gray looked up. â€œYou have explained me to
myself, Harry,â€ he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. â€œI felt
all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not
express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again
of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all.
I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.â€

â€œLife has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that
you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.â€

â€œBut suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What
then?â€

â€œAh, then,â€ said Lord Henry, rising to go, â€œthen, my dear Dorian, you
would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to
you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads
too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We
cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the
club. We are rather late, as it is.â€

â€œI think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat
anything. What is the number of your sisterâ€™s box?â€

â€œTwenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her
name on the door. But I am sorry you wonâ€™t come and dine.â€

â€œI donâ€™t feel up to it,â€ said Dorian listlessly. â€œBut I am awfully
obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my
best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.â€

â€œWe are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,â€ answered Lord
Henry, shaking him by the hand. â€œGood-bye. I shall see you before
nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.â€

As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in
a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.
He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an
interminable time over everything.

As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back. No;
there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of
Sibyl Vaneâ€™s death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious
of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred
the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment
that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it
indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed
within the soul? He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the
change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.

Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked
death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her and taken her
with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed
him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would
always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything by the
sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what
she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.
When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent
on to the worldâ€™s stage to show the supreme reality of love. A
wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her
childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He
brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.

He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his
choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for himâ€”life, and
his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion,
pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sinsâ€”he was to have
all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame:
that was all.

A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that
was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery
of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips
that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat
before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as
it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which
he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be
hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had
so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The
pity of it! the pity of it!

For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that
existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in
answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain
unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender
the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance
might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?
Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer
that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious
scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence
upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon
dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,
might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods
and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?
But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a
prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to
alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?

For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to
follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him
the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so
it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he
would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.
When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of
chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one
blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life
would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and
fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured
image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.

He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,
smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was
already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord
Henry was leaning over his chair.




CHAPTER IX.


As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown
into the room.

â€œI am so glad I have found you, Dorian,â€ he said gravely. â€œI called
last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew
that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really
gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy
might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me
when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late
edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club. I came here at
once and was miserable at not finding you. I canâ€™t tell you how
heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.
But where were you? Did you go down and see the girlâ€™s mother? For a
moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the
paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isnâ€™t it? But I was afraid of
intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a
state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about
it all?â€

â€œMy dear Basil, how do I know?â€ murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some
pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass
and looking dreadfully bored. â€œI was at the opera. You should have come
on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harryâ€™s sister, for the first time. We
were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.
Donâ€™t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesnâ€™t talk about a thing, it
has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives
reality to things. I may mention that she was not the womanâ€™s only
child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on
the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about
yourself and what you are painting.â€

â€œYou went to the opera?â€ said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a
strained touch of pain in his voice. â€œYou went to the opera while Sibyl
Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other
women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl
you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there
are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!â€

â€œStop, Basil! I wonâ€™t hear it!â€ cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. â€œYou
must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is
past.â€

â€œYou call yesterday the past?â€

â€œWhat has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only
shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is
master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a
pleasure. I donâ€™t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use
them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.â€

â€œDorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You
look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come
down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural,
and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the
whole world. Now, I donâ€™t know what has come over you. You talk as if
you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harryâ€™s influence. I see
that.â€

The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few
moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. â€œI owe a great
deal to Harry, Basil,â€ he said at last, â€œmore than I owe to you. You
only taught me to be vain.â€

â€œWell, I am punished for that, Dorianâ€”or shall be some day.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know what you mean, Basil,â€ he exclaimed, turning round. â€œI
donâ€™t know what you want. What do you want?â€

â€œI want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,â€ said the artist sadly.

â€œBasil,â€ said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his
shoulder, â€œyou have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl
Vane had killed herselfâ€”â€

â€œKilled herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?â€ cried
Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.

â€œMy dear Basil! Surely you donâ€™t think it was a vulgar accident? Of
course she killed herself.â€

The elder man buried his face in his hands. â€œHow fearful,â€ he muttered,
and a shudder ran through him.

â€œNo,â€ said Dorian Gray, â€œthere is nothing fearful about it. It is one
of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act
lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful
wives, or something tedious. You know what I meanâ€”middle-class virtue
and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her
finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she playedâ€”the
night you saw herâ€”she acted badly because she had known the reality of
love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.
She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the
martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of
martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not
think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular
momentâ€”about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to sixâ€”you would
have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the
news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered
immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can,
except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come
down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled,
and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a
story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty
years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some
unjust law alteredâ€”I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded,
and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing
to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And
besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me
rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic
point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la
consolation des arts_? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered
book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.
Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at
Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could
console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that
one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work,
carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pompâ€”there is much to
be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,
or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of
oneâ€™s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I
know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not
realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am
a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am
different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must
always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know
that you are better than he is. You are not strongerâ€”you are too much
afraid of lifeâ€”but you are better. And how happy we used to be
together! Donâ€™t leave me, Basil, and donâ€™t quarrel with me. I am what I
am. There is nothing more to be said.â€

The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him,
and his personality had been the great turning point in his art. He
could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his
indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was
so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.

â€œWell, Dorian,â€ he said at length, with a sad smile, â€œI wonâ€™t speak to
you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your
name wonâ€™t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take
place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?â€

Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at
the mention of the word â€œinquest.â€ There was something so crude and
vulgar about everything of the kind. â€œThey donâ€™t know my name,â€ he
answered.

â€œBut surely she did?â€

â€œOnly my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned
to any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn
who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince
Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,
Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a
few kisses and some broken pathetic words.â€

â€œI will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you
must come and sit to me yourself again. I canâ€™t get on without you.â€

â€œI can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!â€ he exclaimed,
starting back.

The painter stared at him. â€œMy dear boy, what nonsense!â€ he cried. â€œDo
you mean to say you donâ€™t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have
you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best
thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply
disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room
looked different as I came in.â€

â€œMy servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You donâ€™t imagine I let
him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimesâ€”that
is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.â€

â€œToo strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for
it. Let me see it.â€ And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.

A cry of terror broke from Dorian Grayâ€™s lips, and he rushed between
the painter and the screen. â€œBasil,â€ he said, looking very pale, â€œyou
must not look at it. I donâ€™t wish you to.â€

â€œNot look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldnâ€™t I look at
it?â€ exclaimed Hallward, laughing.

â€œIf you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never
speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I donâ€™t offer
any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you
touch this screen, everything is over between us.â€

Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute
amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually
pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes
were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.

â€œDorian!â€

â€œDonâ€™t speak!â€

â€œBut what is the matter? Of course I wonâ€™t look at it if you donâ€™t want
me to,â€ he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over
towards the window. â€œBut, really, it seems rather absurd that I
shouldnâ€™t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in
Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of
varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?â€

â€œTo exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?â€ exclaimed Dorian Gray, a
strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be
shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That
was impossible. Somethingâ€”he did not know whatâ€”had to be done at once.

â€œYes; I donâ€™t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going
to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de
SÃ¨ze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only
be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that
time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it
always behind a screen, you canâ€™t care much about it.â€

Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of
perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible
danger. â€œYou told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,â€ he
cried. â€œWhy have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being
consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference
is that your moods are rather meaningless. You canâ€™t have forgotten
that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would
induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the
same thing.â€ He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his
eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half
seriously and half in jest, â€œIf you want to have a strange quarter of
an hour, get Basil to tell you why he wonâ€™t exhibit your picture. He
told me why he wouldnâ€™t, and it was a revelation to me.â€ Yes, perhaps
Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.

â€œBasil,â€ he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in
the face, â€œwe have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall
tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my
picture?â€

The painter shuddered in spite of himself. â€œDorian, if I told you, you
might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I
could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me
never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to
look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from
the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any
fame or reputation.â€

â€œNo, Basil, you must tell me,â€ insisted Dorian Gray. â€œI think I have a
right to know.â€ His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity
had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallwardâ€™s
mystery.

â€œLet us sit down, Dorian,â€ said the painter, looking troubled. â€œLet us
sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the
picture something curious?â€”something that probably at first did not
strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?â€

â€œBasil!â€ cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling
hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.

â€œI see you did. Donâ€™t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.
Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most
extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and
power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen
ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I
worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted
to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When
you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course,
I never let you know anything about this. It would have been
impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it
myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that
the world had become wonderful to my eyesâ€”too wonderful, perhaps, for
in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less
than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew
more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn
you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsmanâ€™s cloak and
polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on
the prow of Adrianâ€™s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You
had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the
waterâ€™s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been
what art should beâ€”unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day
I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as
you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own
dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method,
or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to
me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at
it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I
grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that
I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it
was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You
were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant
to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not
mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I
felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my
studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of
its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that
I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely
good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling
that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is
ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract
than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colourâ€”that is all.
It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely
than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I
determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.
It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were
right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,
Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are
made to be worshipped.â€

Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and
a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the
time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who
had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he
himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord
Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was
too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be
some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of
the things that life had in store?

â€œIt is extraordinary to me, Dorian,â€ said Hallward, â€œthat you should
have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?â€

â€œI saw something in it,â€ he answered, â€œsomething that seemed to me very
curious.â€

â€œWell, you donâ€™t mind my looking at the thing now?â€

Dorian shook his head. â€œYou must not ask me that, Basil. I could not
possibly let you stand in front of that picture.â€

â€œYou will some day, surely?â€

â€œNever.â€

â€œWell, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been
the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I
have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you donâ€™t know what it cost
me to tell you all that I have told you.â€

â€œMy dear Basil,â€ said Dorian, â€œwhat have you told me? Simply that you
felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.â€

â€œIt was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I
have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one
should never put oneâ€™s worship into words.â€

â€œIt was a very disappointing confession.â€

â€œWhy, what did you expect, Dorian? You didnâ€™t see anything else in the
picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?â€

â€œNo; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustnâ€™t
talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we
must always remain so.â€

â€œYou have got Harry,â€ said the painter sadly.

â€œOh, Harry!â€ cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. â€œHarry spends
his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is
improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I
donâ€™t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go
to you, Basil.â€

â€œYou will sit to me again?â€

â€œImpossible!â€

â€œYou spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes
across two ideal things. Few come across one.â€

â€œI canâ€™t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.
There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I
will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.â€

â€œPleasanter for you, I am afraid,â€ murmured Hallward regretfully. â€œAnd
now good-bye. I am sorry you wonâ€™t let me look at the picture once
again. But that canâ€™t be helped. I quite understand what you feel about
it.â€

As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How
little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead
of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded,
almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that
strange confession explained to him! The painterâ€™s absurd fits of
jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious
reticencesâ€”he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed
to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.

He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all
costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad
of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room
to which any of his friends had access.




CHAPTER X.


When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if
he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite
impassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked
over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of
Victorâ€™s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There
was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his
guard.

Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he
wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to
send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man
left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was
that merely his own fancy?

After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread
mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He
asked her for the key of the schoolroom.

â€œThe old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?â€ she exclaimed. â€œWhy, it is full of
dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It
is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.â€

â€œI donâ€™t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.â€

â€œWell, sir, youâ€™ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it
hasnâ€™t been opened for nearly five yearsâ€”not since his lordship died.â€

He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of
him. â€œThat does not matter,â€ he answered. â€œI simply want to see the
placeâ€”that is all. Give me the key.â€

â€œAnd here is the key, sir,â€ said the old lady, going over the contents
of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. â€œHere is the key. Iâ€™ll
have it off the bunch in a moment. But you donâ€™t think of living up
there, sir, and you so comfortable here?â€

â€œNo, no,â€ he cried petulantly. â€œThank you, Leaf. That will do.â€

She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of
the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought
best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.

As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round
the room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily
embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century
Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.
Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps
served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that
had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death
itselfâ€”something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What
the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on
the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They
would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still
live on. It would be always alive.

He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil
the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would
have helped him to resist Lord Henryâ€™s influence, and the still more
poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that
he bore himâ€”for it was really loveâ€”had nothing in it that was not noble
and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty
that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was
such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,
and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was
too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or
forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were
passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that
would make the shadow of their evil real.

He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that
covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was
the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was
unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue
eyes, and rose-red lipsâ€”they all were there. It was simply the
expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared
to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basilâ€™s
reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!â€”how shallow, and of what little
account! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and
calling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung
the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door.
He passed out as his servant entered.

â€œThe persons are here, Monsieur.â€

He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed
to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly
about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the
writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him
round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at
eight-fifteen that evening.

â€œWait for an answer,â€ he said, handing it to him, â€œand show the men in
here.â€

In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard
himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in
with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a
florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was
considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the
artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He
waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in
favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed
everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.

â€œWhat can I do for you, Mr. Gray?â€ he said, rubbing his fat freckled
hands. â€œI thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in
person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a
sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited
for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.â€

â€œI am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.
Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frameâ€”though I donâ€™t
go in much at present for religious artâ€”but to-day I only want a
picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so
I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.â€

â€œNo trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to
you. Which is the work of art, sir?â€

â€œThis,â€ replied Dorian, moving the screen back. â€œCan you move it,
covering and all, just as it is? I donâ€™t want it to get scratched going
upstairs.â€

â€œThere will be no difficulty, sir,â€ said the genial frame-maker,
beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from
the long brass chains by which it was suspended. â€œAnd, now, where shall
we carry it to, Mr. Gray?â€

â€œI will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or
perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top
of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.â€

He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and
began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the
picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious
protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesmanâ€™s spirited dislike
of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it
so as to help them.

â€œSomething of a load to carry, sir,â€ gasped the little man when they
reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.

â€œI am afraid it is rather heavy,â€ murmured Dorian as he unlocked the
door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious
secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.

He had not entered the place for more than four yearsâ€”not, indeed,
since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then
as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large,
well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord
Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness
to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and
desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little
changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically
painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so
often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled
with his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the
same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing
chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded
birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every
moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He
recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed
horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden
away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in
store for him!

But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as
this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its
purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,
and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would
not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He
kept his youthâ€”that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow
finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full
of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and
shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit
and in fleshâ€”those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them
their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would
have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to
the world Basil Hallwardâ€™s masterpiece.

No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon
the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but
the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become
hollow or flaccid. Yellow crowâ€™s feet would creep round the fading eyes
and make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth
would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old
men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined
hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had
been so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed.
There was no help for it.

â€œBring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,â€ he said, wearily, turning round. â€œI
am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.â€

â€œAlways glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,â€ answered the frame-maker, who
was still gasping for breath. â€œWhere shall we put it, sir?â€

â€œOh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I donâ€™t want to have it hung up.
Just lean it against the wall. Thanks.â€

â€œMight one look at the work of art, sir?â€

Dorian started. â€œIt would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,â€ he said,
keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling
him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that
concealed the secret of his life. â€œI shanâ€™t trouble you any more now. I
am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.â€

â€œNot at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,
sir.â€ And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,
who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough
uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.

When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door
and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look
upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.

On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five oâ€™clock
and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark
perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,
his guardianâ€™s wife, a pretty professional invalid, who had spent the
preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside
it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the
edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. Jamesâ€™s Gazette_
had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had
returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were
leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.
He would be sure to miss the pictureâ€”had no doubt missed it already,
while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set
back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he
might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the
room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in oneâ€™s house. He had
heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some
servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked
up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower
or a shred of crumpled lace.

He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henryâ€™s
note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,
and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at
eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. Jamesâ€™s_ languidly, and looked
through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew
attention to the following paragraph:

INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.â€”An inquest was held this morning at the Bell
Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of
Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,
Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable
sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly
affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.
Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.


He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and
flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real
ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for
having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have
marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more
than enough English for that.

Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,
what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vaneâ€™s death?
There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.

His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was
it, he wondered. He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal
stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange
Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung
himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a
few minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he had
ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the
delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb
show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made
real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually
revealed.

It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,
indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who
spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the
passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his
own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through
which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere
artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,
as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The
style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid
and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical
expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work
of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.
There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in
colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical
philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the
spiritual ecstasies of some mediÃ¦val saint or the morbid confessions of
a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense
seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere
cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full
as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,
produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,
a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of
the falling day and creeping shadows.

Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed
through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no
more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the
lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed
the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his
bedside and began to dress for dinner.

It was almost nine oâ€™clock before he reached the club, where he found
Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.

â€œI am so sorry, Harry,â€ he cried, â€œbut really it is entirely your
fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the
time was going.â€

â€œYes, I thought you would like it,â€ replied his host, rising from his
chair.

â€œI didnâ€™t say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a
great difference.â€

â€œAh, you have discovered that?â€ murmured Lord Henry. And they passed
into the dining-room.




CHAPTER XI.


For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of
this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never
sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than
nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in
different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the
changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have
almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in
whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely
blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,
indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own
life, written before he had lived it.

In one point he was more fortunate than the novelâ€™s fantastic hero. He
never knewâ€”never, indeed, had any cause to knowâ€”that somewhat grotesque
dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which
came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned
by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so
remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joyâ€”and perhaps in nearly every
joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its placeâ€”that he used
to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if
somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who
had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly
valued.

For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and
many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had
heard the most evil things against himâ€”and from time to time strange
rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the
chatter of the clubsâ€”could not believe anything to his dishonour when
they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself
unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when
Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his
face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the
memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one
so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an
age that was at once sordid and sensual.

Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged
absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were
his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep
upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left
him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on
the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him
from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to
quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his
own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.
He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and
terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead
or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which
were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would
place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,
and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.

There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own
delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little
ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in
disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he
had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant
because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.
That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as
they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase
with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He
had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.

Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to
society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each
Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the
world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the
day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little
dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were
noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,
as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with
its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered
cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,
especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,
in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often
dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of
the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and
perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of
the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to â€œmake
themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.â€ Like Gautier, he was one
for whom â€œthe visible world existed.â€

And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the
arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.
Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment
universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert
the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for
him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to
time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of
the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in
everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of
his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.

For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost
immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a
subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the
London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the
Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be
something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on
the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of
a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have
its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the
spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.

The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been
decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and
sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are
conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.
But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had
never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal
merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or
to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a
new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the
dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through
history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been
surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful
rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose
origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more
terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,
they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out
the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to
the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.

Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that
was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism
that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its
service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any
theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of
passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself,
and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of
the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy
that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to
concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a
moment.

There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either
after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of
death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through
the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality
itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,
and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one
might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled
with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the
curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb
shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside,
there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men
going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down
from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it
feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from
her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by
degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we
watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan
mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we
had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been
studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the
letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.
Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night
comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where
we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the
necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of
stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids
might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in
the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh
shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in
which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,
in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of
joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.

It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray
to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his
search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and
possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he
would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really
alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and
then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his
intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that
is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,
indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition
of it.

It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman
Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great
attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the
sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb
rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity
of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it
sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement
and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with
white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft
the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at
times, one would fain think, is indeed the â€œ_panis cÃ¦lestis_,â€ the
bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,
breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.
The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet,
tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle
fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at
the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of
them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating
the true story of their lives.

But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual
development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of
mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable
for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which
there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its
marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle
antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a
season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of
the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in
tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the
brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of
the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,
morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him
before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance
compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all
intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.
He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual
mysteries to reveal.

And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their
manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums
from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not
its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their
true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one
mystical, and in ambergris that stirred oneâ€™s passions, and in violets
that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the
brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often
to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several
influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;
of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that
sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to
be able to expel melancholy from the soul.

At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long
latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of
olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad
gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled
Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while
grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching
upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of
reed or brass and charmedâ€”or feigned to charmâ€”great hooded snakes and
horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of
barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubertâ€™s grace, and Chopinâ€™s
beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell
unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world
the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of
dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact
with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the
mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not
allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been
subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the
Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human
bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green
jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular
sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when
they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the
performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the
harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who
sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a
distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating
tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an
elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells
of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge
cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the
one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican
temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a
description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated
him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like
Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous
voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his
box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt
pleasure to â€œTannhauserâ€ and seeing in the prelude to that great work
of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.

On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a
costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered
with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for
years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often
spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various
stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that
turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,
the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,
carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red
cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their
alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the
sunstone, and the moonstoneâ€™s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow
of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of
extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la
vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.

He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonsoâ€™s
Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real
jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of
Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes â€œwith
collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.â€ There was a gem in
the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and â€œby the exhibition
of golden letters and a scarlet robeâ€ the monster could be thrown into
a magical sleep and slain. According to the great alchemist, Pierre de
Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India
made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth
provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The
garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her
colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,
that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.
Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a
newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The
bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm
that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the
aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any
danger by fire.

The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand,
as the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the
Priest were â€œmade of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake
inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.â€ Over the gable
were â€œtwo golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,â€ so that the
gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodgeâ€™s strange
romance â€˜A Margarite of Americaâ€™, it was stated that in the chamber of
the queen one could behold â€œall the chaste ladies of the world,
inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites,
carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.â€ Marco Polo had seen the
inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the
dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver
brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven
moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit,
he flung it awayâ€”Procopius tells the storyâ€”nor was it ever found again,
though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold
pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a
rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he
worshipped.

When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII.
of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to
Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great
light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred
and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty
thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described
Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as
wearing â€œa jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds
and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large
balasses.â€ The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in
gold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold
armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with
turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parsemÃ©_ with pearls. Henry II. wore
jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with
twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the
Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped
pearls and studded with sapphires.

How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and
decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.

Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that
performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern
nations of Europe. As he investigated the subjectâ€”and he always had an
extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in
whatever he took upâ€”he was almost saddened by the reflection of the
ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any
rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils
bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of
their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained
his flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where
had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which
the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls
for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had
stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on
which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot
drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious
table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were
displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;
the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden
bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of
Pontus and were figured with â€œlions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,
rocks, huntersâ€”all, in fact, that a painter can copy from natureâ€; and
the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which
were embroidered the verses of a song beginning â€œ_Madame, je suis tout
joyeux_,â€ the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold
thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four
pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims
for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with â€œthirteen
hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the
kingâ€™s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings
were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked
in gold.â€ Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black
velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask,
with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground,
and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in
a room hung with rows of the queenâ€™s devices in cut black velvet upon
cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen
feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,
was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses
from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased,
and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been
taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed
had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.

And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite
specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting
the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and
stitched over with iridescent beetlesâ€™ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that
from their transparency are known in the East as â€œwoven air,â€ and
â€œrunning water,â€ and â€œevening dewâ€; strange figured cloths from Java;
elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair
blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of
_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish
velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,
with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.

He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed
he had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the
long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had
stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the
raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and
fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by
the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He
possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,
figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in
six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the
pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided
into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the
coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.
This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of
green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,
from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which
were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse
bore a seraphâ€™s head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were
woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with
medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He
had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold
brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with
representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and
embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of
white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins
and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen;
and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices
to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his
imagination.

For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely
house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he
could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times
to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked
room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his
own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the
real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the
purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there,
would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,
his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.
Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to
dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,
until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the
picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times,
with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin,
and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to
bear the burden that should have been his own.

After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and
gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as
well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more
than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the picture
that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his
absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the
elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.

He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true
that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness
of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn
from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not
painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?
Even if he told them, would they believe it?

Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in
Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank
who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton
luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly
leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not
been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it
should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely
the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already
suspected it.

For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.
He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth
and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was
said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the
smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another
gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories
became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It
was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a
low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with
thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His
extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear
again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass
him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though
they were determined to discover his secret.

Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,
and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his
charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth
that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer
to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about
him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most
intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had
wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and
set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or
horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.

Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his
strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of
security. Societyâ€”civilized society, at leastâ€”is never very ready to
believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and
fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance
than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much
less value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after all, it is
a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad
dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the
cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrÃ©es_, as Lord Henry
remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a
good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are,
or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely
essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as
its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic
play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is
insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method
by which we can multiply our personalities.

Such, at any rate, was Dorian Grayâ€™s opinion. He used to wonder at the
shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing
simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a
being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform
creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and
passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies
of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery
of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose
blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by
Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and
King James, as one who was â€œcaressed by the Court for his handsome
face, which kept him not long company.â€ Was it young Herbertâ€™s life
that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body
to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that
ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,
give utterance, in Basil Hallwardâ€™s studio, to the mad prayer that had
so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled
surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,
with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this manâ€™s
legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some
inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams
that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading
canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl
stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand,
and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On
a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green
rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the
strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of
her temperament in him? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look
curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and
fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and
swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.
Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so
overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century,
and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord
Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and
one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How
proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!
What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as
infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the
Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his
wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred
within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady
Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lipsâ€”he knew what he had got
from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the
beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.
There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she
was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes
were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They
seemed to follow him wherever he went.

Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in oneâ€™s own race,
nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly
with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There
were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history
was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act
and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it
had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known
them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the
stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of
subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had
been his own.

The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had
himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how,
crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as
Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of
Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the
flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had
caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in
an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had
wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round
with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his
days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _tÃ¦dium vitÃ¦_, that comes
on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear
emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of
pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the
Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero
Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with
colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon
from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.

Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the
two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious
tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and
beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made
monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted
her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the
dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the
Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and
whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the
price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase
living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot
who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide
riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;
Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and
minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery,
and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson
silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might
serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy
could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion
for red blood, as other men have for red wineâ€”the son of the Fiend, as
was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling
with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the
name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads
was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of
Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the
enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave
poison to Ginevra dâ€™Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a
shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles
VI., who had so wildly adored his brotherâ€™s wife that a leper had
warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his
brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen
cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in
his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto
Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,
and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow
piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,
and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.

There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and
they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of
strange manners of poisoningâ€”poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch,
by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by
an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were
moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could
realize his conception of the beautiful.




CHAPTER XII.


It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth
birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.

He was walking home about eleven oâ€™clock from Lord Henryâ€™s, where he
had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold
and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a
man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of
his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized
him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could
not account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on
quickly in the direction of his own house.

But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the
pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on
his arm.

â€œDorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for
you in your library ever since nine oâ€™clock. Finally I took pity on
your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am
off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see
you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as
you passed me. But I wasnâ€™t quite sure. Didnâ€™t you recognize me?â€

â€œIn this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I canâ€™t even recognize Grosvenor
Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I donâ€™t feel at
all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen
you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?â€

â€œNo: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a
studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture
I have in my head. However, it wasnâ€™t about myself I wanted to talk.
Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something
to say to you.â€

â€œI shall be charmed. But wonâ€™t you miss your train?â€ said Dorian Gray
languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his
latch-key.

The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his
watch. â€œI have heaps of time,â€ he answered. â€œThe train doesnâ€™t go till
twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to
the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shanâ€™t have any
delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with
me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.â€

Dorian looked at him and smiled. â€œWhat a way for a fashionable painter
to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get
into the house. And mind you donâ€™t talk about anything serious. Nothing
is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.â€

Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the
library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.
The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with
some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little
marqueterie table.

â€œYou see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me
everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is
a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman
you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?â€

Dorian shrugged his shoulders. â€œI believe he married Lady Radleyâ€™s
maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.
_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly
of the French, doesnâ€™t it? Butâ€”do you know?â€”he was not at all a bad
servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One
often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted
to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another
brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take
hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.â€

â€œThanks, I wonâ€™t have anything more,â€ said the painter, taking his cap
and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the
corner. â€œAnd now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.
Donâ€™t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.â€

â€œWhat is it all about?â€ cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging
himself down on the sofa. â€œI hope it is not about myself. I am tired of
myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.â€

â€œIt is about yourself,â€ answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, â€œand
I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.â€

Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. â€œHalf an hour!â€ he murmured.

â€œIt is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own
sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the
most dreadful things are being said against you in London.â€

â€œI donâ€™t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other
people, but scandals about myself donâ€™t interest me. They have not got
the charm of novelty.â€

â€œThey must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his
good name. You donâ€™t want people to talk of you as something vile and
degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all
that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind
you, I donâ€™t believe these rumours at all. At least, I canâ€™t believe
them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a manâ€™s
face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.
There are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself
in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of
his hands even. Somebodyâ€”I wonâ€™t mention his name, but you know
himâ€”came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen
him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though
I have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I
refused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I
hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.
His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent
face, and your marvellous untroubled youthâ€”I canâ€™t believe anything
against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to
the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these
hideous things that people are whispering about you, I donâ€™t know what
to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves
the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen
in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You
used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week.
Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the
miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley
curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,
but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to
know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I
reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.
He told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why
is your friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy
in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There
was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.
You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his
dreadful end? What about Lord Kentâ€™s only son and his career? I met his
father yesterday in St. Jamesâ€™s Street. He seemed broken with shame and
sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he
got now? What gentleman would associate with him?â€

â€œStop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,â€
said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt
in his voice. â€œYou ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It
is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows
anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could
his record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did
I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kentâ€™s
silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me? If
Adrian Singleton writes his friendâ€™s name across a bill, am I his
keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air
their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper
about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try
and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with
the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to
have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.
And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead
themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land
of the hypocrite.â€

â€œDorian,â€ cried Hallward, â€œthat is not the question. England is bad
enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why
I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge
of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all
sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a
madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them
there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are
smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are
inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not
have made his sisterâ€™s name a by-word.â€

â€œTake care, Basil. You go too far.â€

â€œI must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady
Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a
single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?
Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are
other storiesâ€”stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of
dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in
London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I
laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your
country-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you donâ€™t know
what is said about you. I wonâ€™t tell you that I donâ€™t want to preach to
you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself
into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and
then proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want
you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you
to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the
dreadful people you associate with. Donâ€™t shrug your shoulders like
that. Donâ€™t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it
be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with
whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to
enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I donâ€™t know
whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am
told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one
of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife
had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.
Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I
told him that it was absurdâ€”that I knew you thoroughly, and that you
were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know
you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.â€

â€œTo see my soul!â€ muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and
turning almost white from fear.

â€œYes,â€ answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his
voice, â€œto see your soul. But only God can do that.â€

A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. â€œYou
shall see it yourself, to-night!â€ he cried, seizing a lamp from the
table. â€œCome: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldnâ€™t you look at it?
You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody
would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the
better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate
about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough
about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.â€

There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his
foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible
joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that
the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his
shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous
memory of what he had done.

â€œYes,â€ he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into
his stern eyes, â€œI shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that
you fancy only God can see.â€

Hallward started back. â€œThis is blasphemy, Dorian!â€ he cried. â€œYou must
not say things like that. They are horrible, and they donâ€™t mean
anything.â€

â€œYou think so?â€ He laughed again.

â€œI know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your
good. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.â€

â€œDonâ€™t touch me. Finish what you have to say.â€

A twisted flash of pain shot across the painterâ€™s face. He paused for a
moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right
had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of
what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he
straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood
there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their
throbbing cores of flame.

â€œI am waiting, Basil,â€ said the young man in a hard clear voice.

He turned round. â€œWhat I have to say is this,â€ he cried. â€œYou must give
me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If
you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I
shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Canâ€™t you see what I
am going through? My God! donâ€™t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt,
and shameful.â€

Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. â€œCome
upstairs, Basil,â€ he said quietly. â€œI keep a diary of my life from day
to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall
show it to you if you come with me.â€

â€œI shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my
train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But donâ€™t ask me to
read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.â€

â€œThat shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You
will not have to read long.â€




CHAPTER XIII.


He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward
following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at
night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A
rising wind made some of the windows rattle.

When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the
floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. â€œYou insist on
knowing, Basil?â€ he asked in a low voice.

â€œYes.â€

â€œI am delighted,â€ he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat
harshly, â€œYou are the one man in the world who is entitled to know
everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you
thinkâ€; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold
current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a
flame of murky orange. He shuddered. â€œShut the door behind you,â€ he
whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.

Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked
as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a
curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty
book-caseâ€”that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a
table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was
standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered
with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling
behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.

â€œSo you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that
curtain back, and you will see mine.â€

The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. â€œYou are mad, Dorian, or
playing a part,â€ muttered Hallward, frowning.

â€œYou wonâ€™t? Then I must do it myself,â€ said the young man, and he tore
the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.

An exclamation of horror broke from the painterâ€™s lips as he saw in the
dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was
something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.
Good heavens! it was Dorian Grayâ€™s own face that he was looking at! The
horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous
beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet
on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the
loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely
passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it
was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own
brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous,
yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the
picture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long
letters of bright vermilion.

It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never
done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if
his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own
picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at
Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his
parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across
his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.

The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with
that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are
absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither
real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the
spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken
the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do
so.

â€œWhat does this mean?â€ cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded
shrill and curious in his ears.

â€œYears ago, when I was a boy,â€ said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in
his hand, â€œyou met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my
good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who
explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me
that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even
now, I donâ€™t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you
would call it a prayer....â€

â€œI remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is
impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The
paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the
thing is impossible.â€

â€œAh, what is impossible?â€ murmured the young man, going over to the
window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.

â€œYou told me you had destroyed it.â€

â€œI was wrong. It has destroyed me.â€

â€œI donâ€™t believe it is my picture.â€

â€œCanâ€™t you see your ideal in it?â€ said Dorian bitterly.

â€œMy ideal, as you call it...â€

â€œAs you called it.â€

â€œThere was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an
ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.â€

â€œIt is the face of my soul.â€

â€œChrist! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a
devil.â€

â€œEach of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,â€ cried Dorian with a
wild gesture of despair.

Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. â€œMy God! If it
is true,â€ he exclaimed, â€œand this is what you have done with your life,
why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you
to be!â€ He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The
surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was
from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through
some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly
eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was
not so fearful.

His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and
lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he
flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and
buried his face in his hands.

â€œGood God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!â€ There was no
answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. â€œPray,
Dorian, pray,â€ he murmured. â€œWhat is it that one was taught to say in
oneâ€™s boyhood? â€˜Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash
away our iniquities.â€™ Let us say that together. The prayer of your
pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered
also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped
yourself too much. We are both punished.â€

Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed
eyes. â€œIt is too late, Basil,â€ he faltered.

â€œIt is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot
remember a prayer. Isnâ€™t there a verse somewhere, â€˜Though your sins be
as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snowâ€™?â€

â€œThose words mean nothing to me now.â€

â€œHush! Donâ€™t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God!
Donâ€™t you see that accursed thing leering at us?â€

Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable
feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had
been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his
ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred
within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more
than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly
around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced
him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he
had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had
forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing
Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and
turned round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.
He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind
the ear, crushing the manâ€™s head down on the table and stabbing again
and again.

There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking
with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,
waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice
more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the
floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he
threw the knife on the table, and listened.

He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He
opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely
quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the
balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.
Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in
as he did so.

The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with
bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been
for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was
slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was
simply asleep.

How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking
over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind
had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacockâ€™s
tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the
policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on
the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom
gleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl
was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and
then she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse
voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She
stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The
gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their
black iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the
window behind him.

Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not
even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole
thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the
fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his
life. That was enough.

Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish
workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished
steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed
by his servant, and questions would be asked. He hesitated for a
moment, then he turned back and took it from the table. He could not
help seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the
long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image.

Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The
woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped
several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the
sound of his own footsteps.

When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.
They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was
in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,
and put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he
pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.

He sat down and began to think. Every yearâ€”every month, almostâ€”men were
strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of
murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth....
And yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left
the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the
servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes.
It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he
had intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months
before any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything could be
destroyed long before then.

A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went
out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the
policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the
bullâ€™s-eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his breath.

After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting
the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In
about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very
drowsy.

â€œI am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,â€ he said, stepping in;
â€œbut I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?â€

â€œTen minutes past two, sir,â€ answered the man, looking at the clock and
blinking.

â€œTen minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine
to-morrow. I have some work to do.â€

â€œAll right, sir.â€

â€œDid any one call this evening?â€

â€œMr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away
to catch his train.â€

â€œOh! I am sorry I didnâ€™t see him. Did he leave any message?â€

â€œNo, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not
find you at the club.â€

â€œThat will do, Francis. Donâ€™t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.â€

â€œNo, sir.â€

The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.

Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the
library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,
biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one
of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. â€œAlan Campbell, 152,
Hertford Street, Mayfair.â€ Yes; that was the man he wanted.




CHAPTER XIV.


At nine oâ€™clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of
chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite
peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his
cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.

The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as
he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he
had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all.
His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But
youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.

He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his
chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The
sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost
like a morning in May.

Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,
blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there
with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had
suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for
Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came
back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still
sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!
Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.

He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken
or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory
than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride
more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of
joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the
senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out
of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might
strangle one itself.

When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and
then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual
care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and
scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once. He spent a long time
also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet
about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the
servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the
letters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times
over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.
â€œThat awful thing, a womanâ€™s memory!â€ as Lord Henry had once said.

After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly
with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the
table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the
other he handed to the valet.

â€œTake this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell
is out of town, get his address.â€

As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a
piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and
then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew
seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and
getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.
He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until
it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.

When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page
of the book. It was Gautierâ€™s â€œÃ‰maux et CamÃ©esâ€, Charpentierâ€™s
Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of
citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted
pomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he
turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of
Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand â€œ_du supplice encore mal lavÃ©e_,â€ with
its downy red hairs and its â€œ_doigts de faune_.â€ He glanced at his own
white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and
passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:

Sur une gamme chromatique,
    Le sein de perles ruisselant,
La VÃ©nus de lâ€™Adriatique
    Sort de lâ€™eau son corps rose et blanc.

Les dÃ´mes, sur lâ€™azur des ondes
    Suivant la phrase au pur contour,
Sâ€™enflent comme des gorges rondes
    Que soulÃ¨ve un soupir dâ€™amour.

Lâ€™esquif aborde et me dÃ©pose,
    Jetant son amarre au pilier,
Devant une faÃ§ade rose,
    Sur le marbre dâ€™un escalier.


How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating
down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black
gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked
to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as
one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him
of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the
tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through
the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he
kept saying over and over to himself:

â€œDevant une faÃ§ade rose,
Sur le marbre dâ€™un escalier.â€


The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn
that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to
mad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,
like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true
romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had
been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor
Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!

He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read
of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _cafÃ©_ at Smyrna
where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned
merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each
other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps
tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by
the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red
ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small
beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood
over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell
of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the
â€œ_monstre charmant_â€ that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.
But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a
horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be
out of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he
might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital
importance.

They had been great friends once, five years beforeâ€”almost inseparable,
indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in
society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never
did.

He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real
appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the
beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His
dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had
spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken
a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was
still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his
own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the
annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for
Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up
prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and
played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In
fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray
togetherâ€”music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be
able to exercise whenever he wishedâ€”and, indeed, exercised often
without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshireâ€™s the
night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always
seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For
eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at
Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian
Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in
life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever
knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they
met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at
which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, tooâ€”was strangely
melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and
would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called
upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in
which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to
become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice
in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious
experiments.

This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept
glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly
agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,
looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.
His hands were curiously cold.

The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with
feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the
jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting
for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands
his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight
and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The brain
had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made
grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,
danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving
masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,
slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being
dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its
grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him
stone.

At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes
upon him.

â€œMr. Campbell, sir,â€ said the man.

A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back
to his cheeks.

â€œAsk him to come in at once, Francis.â€ He felt that he was himself
again. His mood of cowardice had passed away.

The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,
looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his
coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.

â€œAlan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.â€

â€œI had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it
was a matter of life and death.â€ His voice was hard and cold. He spoke
with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady
searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the
pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the
gesture with which he had been greeted.

â€œYes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one
person. Sit down.â€

Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The
two menâ€™s eyes met. In Dorianâ€™s there was infinite pity. He knew that
what he was going to do was dreadful.

After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very
quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he
had sent for, â€œAlan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room
to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.
He has been dead ten hours now. Donâ€™t stir, and donâ€™t look at me like
that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not
concern you. What you have to do is thisâ€”â€

â€œStop, Gray. I donâ€™t want to know anything further. Whether what you
have told me is true or not true doesnâ€™t concern me. I entirely decline
to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.
They donâ€™t interest me any more.â€

â€œAlan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest
you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I canâ€™t help myself. You are
the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the
matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about
chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you
have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairsâ€”to destroy it
so that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come
into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in
Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must
be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and
everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may
scatter in the air.â€

â€œYou are mad, Dorian.â€

â€œAh! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.â€

â€œYou are mad, I tell youâ€”mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to
help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to
do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril
my reputation for you? What is it to me what devilâ€™s work you are up
to?â€

â€œIt was suicide, Alan.â€

â€œI am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.â€

â€œDo you still refuse to do this for me?â€

â€œOf course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I
donâ€™t care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be
sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of
all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have
thought you knew more about peopleâ€™s characters. Your friend Lord Henry
Wotton canâ€™t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he
has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You
have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Donâ€™t come to
me.â€

â€œAlan, it was murder. I killed him. You donâ€™t know what he had made me
suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the
marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the
result was the same.â€

â€œMurder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not
inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in
the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime
without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.â€

â€œYou must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to
me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain
scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the
horrors that you do there donâ€™t affect you. If in some hideous
dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a
leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow
through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You
would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing
anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were
benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the
world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.
What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.
Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are
accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence
against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be
discovered unless you help me.â€

â€œI have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent
to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.â€

â€œAlan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you
came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some
day. No! donâ€™t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the
scientific point of view. You donâ€™t inquire where the dead things on
which you experiment come from. Donâ€™t inquire now. I have told you too
much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,
Alan.â€

â€œDonâ€™t speak about those days, Dorianâ€”they are dead.â€

â€œThe dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is
sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan!
If you donâ€™t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang
me, Alan! Donâ€™t you understand? They will hang me for what I have
done.â€

â€œThere is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do
anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.â€

â€œYou refuse?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI entreat you, Alan.â€

â€œIt is useless.â€

The same look of pity came into Dorian Grayâ€™s eyes. Then he stretched
out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read
it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.
Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.

Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and
opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back
in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if
his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.

After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and
came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.

â€œI am so sorry for you, Alan,â€ he murmured, â€œbut you leave me no
alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the
address. If you donâ€™t help me, I must send it. If you donâ€™t help me, I
will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to
help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you.
You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh,
offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat meâ€”no
living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate
terms.â€

Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through
him.

â€œYes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The
thing is quite simple. Come, donâ€™t work yourself into this fever. The
thing has to be done. Face it, and do it.â€

A groan broke from Campbellâ€™s lips and he shivered all over. The
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing
time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be
borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his
forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already
come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.
It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him.

â€œCome, Alan, you must decide at once.â€

â€œI cannot do it,â€ he said, mechanically, as though words could alter
things.

â€œYou must. You have no choice. Donâ€™t delay.â€

He hesitated a moment. â€œIs there a fire in the room upstairs?â€

â€œYes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.â€

â€œI shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.â€

â€œNo, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of
notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the
things back to you.â€

Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope
to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then
he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as
soon as possible and to bring the things with him.

As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up
from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a
kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A
fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was
like the beat of a hammer.

As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian
Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in
the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.
â€œYou are infamous, absolutely infamous!â€ he muttered.

â€œHush, Alan. You have saved my life,â€ said Dorian.

â€œYour life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from
corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In
doing what I am going to doâ€”what you force me to doâ€”it is not of your
life that I am thinking.â€

â€œAh, Alan,â€ murmured Dorian with a sigh, â€œI wish you had a thousandth
part of the pity for me that I have for you.â€ He turned away as he
spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.

After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant
entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil
of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.

â€œShall I leave the things here, sir?â€ he asked Campbell.

â€œYes,â€ said Dorian. â€œAnd I am afraid, Francis, that I have another
errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies
Selby with orchids?â€

â€œHarden, sir.â€

â€œYesâ€”Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden
personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,
and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I donâ€™t want any
white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty
placeâ€”otherwise I wouldnâ€™t bother you about it.â€

â€œNo trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?â€

Dorian looked at Campbell. â€œHow long will your experiment take, Alan?â€
he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in
the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.

Campbell frowned and bit his lip. â€œIt will take about five hours,â€ he
answered.

â€œIt will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,
Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have
the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want
you.â€

â€œThank you, sir,â€ said the man, leaving the room.

â€œNow, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!
Iâ€™ll take it for you. You bring the other things.â€ He spoke rapidly and
in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left
the room together.

When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned
it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his
eyes. He shuddered. â€œI donâ€™t think I can go in, Alan,â€ he murmured.

â€œIt is nothing to me. I donâ€™t require you,â€ said Campbell coldly.

Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his
portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn
curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had
forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,
and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.

What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on
one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible
it was!â€”more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent
thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose
grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had
not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.

He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with
half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that
he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and
taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the
picture.

There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed
themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard
Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other
things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder
if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had
thought of each other.

â€œLeave me now,â€ said a stern voice behind him.

He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been
thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a
glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the key
being turned in the lock.

It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He
was pale, but absolutely calm. â€œI have done what you asked me to do,â€
he muttered. â€œAnd now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.â€

â€œYou have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,â€ said Dorian
simply.

As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible
smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting
at the table was gone.




CHAPTER XV.


That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large
button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady
Narboroughâ€™s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was
throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his
manner as he bent over his hostessâ€™s hand was as easy and graceful as
ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at oneâ€™s ease as when one has to
play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could
have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any
tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have
clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God
and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his
demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a
double life.

It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who
was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the
remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife
to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband
properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and
married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted
herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and
French _esprit_ when she could get it.

Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that
she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. â€œI know, my
dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,â€ she used to say,
â€œand thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most
fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our
bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to
raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.
However, that was all Narboroughâ€™s fault. He was dreadfully
short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who
never sees anything.â€

Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she
explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married
daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make
matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. â€œI think it
is most unkind of her, my dear,â€ she whispered. â€œOf course I go and
stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old
woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake
them up. You donâ€™t know what an existence they lead down there. It is
pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have
so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to
think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since
the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep
after dinner. You shanâ€™t sit next either of them. You shall sit by me
and amuse me.â€

Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:
it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen
before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those
middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,
but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an
overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always
trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to
her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against
her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and
Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostessâ€™s daughter, a dowdy
dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once
seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,
white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the
impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of
ideas.

He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the
great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the
mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: â€œHow horrid of Henry Wotton to be
so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised
faithfully not to disappoint me.â€

It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door
opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some
insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.

But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away
untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called â€œan
insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,â€ and
now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence
and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his glass
with champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.

â€œDorian,â€ said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being
handed round, â€œwhat is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out
of sorts.â€

â€œI believe he is in love,â€ cried Lady Narborough, â€œand that he is
afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I
certainly should.â€

â€œDear Lady Narborough,â€ murmured Dorian, smiling, â€œI have not been in
love for a whole weekâ€”not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.â€

â€œHow you men can fall in love with that woman!â€ exclaimed the old lady.
â€œI really cannot understand it.â€

â€œIt is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,
Lady Narborough,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œShe is the one link between us and
your short frocks.â€

â€œShe does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I
remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _dÃ©colletÃ©e_
she was then.â€

â€œShe is still _dÃ©colletÃ©e_,â€ he answered, taking an olive in his long
fingers; â€œand when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an
_Ã©dition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and
full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.
When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.â€

â€œHow can you, Harry!â€ cried Dorian.

â€œIt is a most romantic explanation,â€ laughed the hostess. â€œBut her
third husband, Lord Henry! You donâ€™t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?â€

â€œCertainly, Lady Narborough.â€

â€œI donâ€™t believe a word of it.â€

â€œWell, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.â€

â€œIs it true, Mr. Gray?â€

â€œShe assures me so, Lady Narborough,â€ said Dorian. â€œI asked her
whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and
hung at her girdle. She told me she didnâ€™t, because none of them had
had any hearts at all.â€

â€œFour husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de zÃªle_.â€

â€œ_Trop dâ€™audace_, I tell her,â€ said Dorian.

â€œOh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol
like? I donâ€™t know him.â€

â€œThe husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,â€
said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.

Lady Narborough hit him with her fan. â€œLord Henry, I am not at all
surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.â€

â€œBut what world says that?â€ asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.
â€œIt can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent
terms.â€

â€œEverybody I know says you are very wicked,â€ cried the old lady,
shaking her head.

Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. â€œIt is perfectly
monstrous,â€ he said, at last, â€œthe way people go about nowadays saying
things against one behind oneâ€™s back that are absolutely and entirely
true.â€

â€œIsnâ€™t he incorrigible?â€ cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.

â€œI hope so,â€ said his hostess, laughing. â€œBut really, if you all
worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry
again so as to be in the fashion.â€

â€œYou will never marry again, Lady Narborough,â€ broke in Lord Henry.
â€œYou were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she
detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he
adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.â€

â€œNarborough wasnâ€™t perfect,â€ cried the old lady.

â€œIf he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,â€ was the
rejoinder. â€œWomen love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,
they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never
ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,
but it is quite true.â€

â€œOf course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for
your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be
married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,
that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like
bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.â€

â€œ_Fin de siÃªcle_,â€ murmured Lord Henry.

â€œ_Fin du globe_,â€ answered his hostess.

â€œI wish it were _fin du globe_,â€ said Dorian with a sigh. â€œLife is a
great disappointment.â€

â€œAh, my dear,â€ cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, â€œdonâ€™t
tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows
that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes
wish that I had been; but you are made to be goodâ€”you look so good. I
must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, donâ€™t you think that Mr. Gray
should get married?â€

â€œI am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,â€ said Lord Henry with a
bow.

â€œWell, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go
through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the
eligible young ladies.â€

â€œWith their ages, Lady Narborough?â€ asked Dorian.

â€œOf course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done
in a hurry. I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable
alliance, and I want you both to be happy.â€

â€œWhat nonsense people talk about happy marriages!â€ exclaimed Lord
Henry. â€œA man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love
her.â€

â€œAh! what a cynic you are!â€ cried the old lady, pushing back her chair
and nodding to Lady Ruxton. â€œYou must come and dine with me soon again.
You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew
prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet,
though. I want it to be a delightful gathering.â€

â€œI like men who have a future and women who have a past,â€ he answered.
â€œOr do you think that would make it a petticoat party?â€

â€œI fear so,â€ she said, laughing, as she stood up. â€œA thousand pardons,
my dear Lady Ruxton,â€ she added, â€œI didnâ€™t see you hadnâ€™t finished your
cigarette.â€

â€œNever mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am going
to limit myself, for the future.â€

â€œPray donâ€™t, Lady Ruxton,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œModeration is a fatal
thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a
feast.â€

Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. â€œYou must come and explain that
to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,â€ she
murmured, as she swept out of the room.

â€œNow, mind you donâ€™t stay too long over your politics and scandal,â€
cried Lady Narborough from the door. â€œIf you do, we are sure to
squabble upstairs.â€

The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the
table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and
sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the
situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The
word _doctrinaire_â€”word full of terror to the British mindâ€”reappeared
from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served
as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles
of thought. The inherited stupidity of the raceâ€”sound English common
sense he jovially termed itâ€”was shown to be the proper bulwark for
society.

A smile curved Lord Henryâ€™s lips, and he turned round and looked at
Dorian.

â€œAre you better, my dear fellow?â€ he asked. â€œYou seemed rather out of
sorts at dinner.â€

â€œI am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.â€

â€œYou were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to
you. She tells me she is going down to Selby.â€

â€œShe has promised to come on the twentieth.â€

â€œIs Monmouth to be there, too?â€

â€œOh, yes, Harry.â€

â€œHe bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very
clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of
weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image
precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.
White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and
what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences.â€

â€œHow long has she been married?â€ asked Dorian.

â€œAn eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is
ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,
with time thrown in. Who else is coming?â€

â€œOh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey
Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.â€

â€œI like him,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œA great many people donâ€™t, but I find
him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by
being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to
Monte Carlo with his father.â€

â€œAh! what a nuisance peopleâ€™s people are! Try and make him come. By the
way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven.
What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?â€

Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.

â€œNo, Harry,â€ he said at last, â€œI did not get home till nearly three.â€

â€œDid you go to the club?â€

â€œYes,â€ he answered. Then he bit his lip. â€œNo, I donâ€™t mean that. I
didnâ€™t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How
inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been
doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at
half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my
latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any
corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.â€

Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. â€œMy dear fellow, as if I cared! Let
us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.
Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not
yourself to-night.â€

â€œDonâ€™t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come
round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady
Narborough. I shanâ€™t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.â€

â€œAll right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.
The duchess is coming.â€

â€œI will try to be there, Harry,â€ he said, leaving the room. As he drove
back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he
thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henryâ€™s casual
questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted
his nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He
winced. He hated the idea of even touching them.

Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the
door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had
thrust Basil Hallwardâ€™s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled
another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning
leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume
everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some
Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and
forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.

Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed
nervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large
Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue
lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and
make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet
almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He
lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the
long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the
cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,
went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A
triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively
towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese
box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides
patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round
crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside
was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and
persistent.

He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his
face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly
hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes
to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did
so, and went into his bedroom.

As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,
dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept
quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good
horse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.

The man shook his head. â€œIt is too far for me,â€ he muttered.

â€œHere is a sovereign for you,â€ said Dorian. â€œYou shall have another if
you drive fast.â€

â€œAll right, sir,â€ answered the man, â€œyou will be there in an hour,â€ and
after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly
towards the river.




CHAPTER XVI.


A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly
in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men
and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some
of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards
brawled and screamed.

Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian
Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and
now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said
to him on the first day they had met, â€œTo cure the soul by means of the
senses, and the senses by means of the soul.â€ Yes, that was the secret.
He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium
dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of
old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.

The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a
huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The
gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the
man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from
the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom
were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.

â€œTo cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of
the soul!â€ How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was
sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent
blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there
was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness
was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing
out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.
Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who
had made him a judge over others? He had said things that were
dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.

On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each
step. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The
hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and
his delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse
madly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in
answer, and the man was silent.

The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some
sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist
thickened, he felt afraid.

Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and
he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,
fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in
the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a
rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.

After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over
rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then
fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He
watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made
gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his heart.
As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open
door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The
driver beat at them with his whip.

It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with
hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped
those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in
them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by
intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would
still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept
the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all
manâ€™s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.
Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,
became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one
reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of
disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more
vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious
shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for
forgetfulness. In three days he would be free.

Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over
the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black
masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the
yards.

â€œSomewhere about here, sir, ainâ€™t it?â€ he asked huskily through the
trap.

Dorian started and peered round. â€œThis will do,â€ he answered, and
having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had
promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and
there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The
light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an
outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like
a wet mackintosh.

He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he
was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small
shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of
the top-windows stood a lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.

After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being
unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word
to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as
he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that
swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the
street. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as
if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring
gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced
them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin
backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered
with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and
stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching
by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing
their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head
buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily
painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women,
mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an
expression of disgust. â€œHe thinks heâ€™s got red ants on him,â€ laughed
one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror and
began to whimper.

At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a
darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the
heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils
quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow
hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up
at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.

â€œYou here, Adrian?â€ muttered Dorian.

â€œWhere else should I be?â€ he answered, listlessly. â€œNone of the chaps
will speak to me now.â€

â€œI thought you had left England.â€

â€œDarlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at
last. George doesnâ€™t speak to me either.... I donâ€™t care,â€ he added
with a sigh. â€œAs long as one has this stuff, one doesnâ€™t want friends.
I think I have had too many friends.â€

Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such
fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the
gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in
what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were
teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he
was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was
eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of
Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The
presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one
would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.

â€œI am going on to the other place,â€ he said after a pause.

â€œOn the wharf?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThat mad-cat is sure to be there. They wonâ€™t have her in this place
now.â€

Dorian shrugged his shoulders. â€œI am sick of women who love one. Women
who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.â€

â€œMuch the same.â€

â€œI like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have
something.â€

â€œI donâ€™t want anything,â€ murmured the young man.

â€œNever mind.â€

Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A
half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous
greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of
them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his back
on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.

A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of
the women. â€œWe are very proud to-night,â€ she sneered.

â€œFor Godâ€™s sake donâ€™t talk to me,â€ cried Dorian, stamping his foot on
the ground. â€œWhat do you want? Money? Here it is. Donâ€™t ever talk to me
again.â€

Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the womanâ€™s sodden eyes, then
flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head and
raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion
watched her enviously.

â€œItâ€™s no use,â€ sighed Adrian Singleton. â€œI donâ€™t care to go back. What
does it matter? I am quite happy here.â€

â€œYou will write to me if you want anything, wonâ€™t you?â€ said Dorian,
after a pause.

â€œPerhaps.â€

â€œGood night, then.â€

â€œGood night,â€ answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping
his parched mouth with a handkerchief.

Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he drew
the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the
woman who had taken his money. â€œThere goes the devilâ€™s bargain!â€ she
hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.

â€œCurse you!â€ he answered, â€œdonâ€™t call me that.â€

She snapped her fingers. â€œPrince Charming is what you like to be
called, ainâ€™t it?â€ she yelled after him.

The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly
round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear. He
rushed out as if in pursuit.

Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His
meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered
if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as
Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit his
lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did
it matter to him? Oneâ€™s days were too brief to take the burden of
anotherâ€™s errors on oneâ€™s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and
paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so
often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.
In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.

There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or
for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of
the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful
impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.
They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken
from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all,
lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.
For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of
disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell
from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.

Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for
rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but
as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a
short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself
suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself,
he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his
throat.

He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the
tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver,
and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head,
and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.

â€œWhat do you want?â€ he gasped.

â€œKeep quiet,â€ said the man. â€œIf you stir, I shoot you.â€

â€œYou are mad. What have I done to you?â€

â€œYou wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,â€ was the answer, â€œand Sibyl Vane
was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at your
door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you.
I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described you
were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.
I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace with God, for to-night
you are going to die.â€

Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. â€œI never knew her,â€ he stammered. â€œI
never heard of her. You are mad.â€

â€œYou had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you
are going to die.â€ There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know
what to say or do. â€œDown on your knees!â€ growled the man. â€œI give you
one minute to make your peaceâ€”no more. I go on board to-night for
India, and I must do my job first. One minute. Thatâ€™s all.â€

Dorianâ€™s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know
what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. â€œStop,â€ he
cried. â€œHow long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell me!â€

â€œEighteen years,â€ said the man. â€œWhy do you ask me? What do years
matter?â€

â€œEighteen years,â€ laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his
voice. â€œEighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!â€

James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.
Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.

Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him
the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face
of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the
unstained purity of youth. He seemed little more than a lad of twenty
summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been
when they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was
not the man who had destroyed her life.

He loosened his hold and reeled back. â€œMy God! my God!â€ he cried, â€œand
I would have murdered you!â€

Dorian Gray drew a long breath. â€œYou have been on the brink of
committing a terrible crime, my man,â€ he said, looking at him sternly.
â€œLet this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own
hands.â€

â€œForgive me, sir,â€ muttered James Vane. â€œI was deceived. A chance word
I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.â€

â€œYou had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into
trouble,â€ said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the
street.

James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head
to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping
along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him
with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked
round with a start. It was one of the women who had been drinking at
the bar.

â€œWhy didnâ€™t you kill him?â€ she hissed out, putting haggard face quite
close to his. â€œI knew you were following him when you rushed out from
Dalyâ€™s. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots of money, and
heâ€™s as bad as bad.â€

â€œHe is not the man I am looking for,â€ he answered, â€œand I want no manâ€™s
money. I want a manâ€™s life. The man whose life I want must be nearly
forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not
got his blood upon my hands.â€

The woman gave a bitter laugh. â€œLittle more than a boy!â€ she sneered.
â€œWhy, man, itâ€™s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me
what I am.â€

â€œYou lie!â€ cried James Vane.

She raised her hand up to heaven. â€œBefore God I am telling the truth,â€
she cried.

â€œBefore God?â€

â€œStrike me dumb if it ainâ€™t so. He is the worst one that comes here.
They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. Itâ€™s nigh
on eighteen years since I met him. He hasnâ€™t changed much since then. I
have, though,â€ she added, with a sickly leer.

â€œYou swear this?â€

â€œI swear it,â€ came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. â€œBut donâ€™t give
me away to him,â€ she whined; â€œI am afraid of him. Let me have some
money for my nightâ€™s lodging.â€

He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,
but Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the woman had
vanished also.




CHAPTER XVII.


A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby
Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,
a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time,
and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the
table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at
which the duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving daintily
among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that
Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped
wicker chair, looking at them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady
Narborough, pretending to listen to the dukeâ€™s description of the last
Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. Three young men
in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.
The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more
expected to arrive on the next day.

â€œWhat are you two talking about?â€ said Lord Henry, strolling over to
the table and putting his cup down. â€œI hope Dorian has told you about
my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.â€

â€œBut I donâ€™t want to be rechristened, Harry,â€ rejoined the duchess,
looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. â€œI am quite satisfied with
my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.â€

â€œMy dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are
both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an
orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as
effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one
of the gardeners what it was called. He told me it was a fine specimen
of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad
truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.
Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is
with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The
man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It
is the only thing he is fit for.â€

â€œThen what should we call you, Harry?â€ she asked.

â€œHis name is Prince Paradox,â€ said Dorian.

â€œI recognize him in a flash,â€ exclaimed the duchess.

â€œI wonâ€™t hear of it,â€ laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair. â€œFrom a
label there is no escape! I refuse the title.â€

â€œRoyalties may not abdicate,â€ fell as a warning from pretty lips.

â€œYou wish me to defend my throne, then?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI give the truths of to-morrow.â€

â€œI prefer the mistakes of to-day,â€ she answered.

â€œYou disarm me, Gladys,â€ he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.

â€œOf your shield, Harry, not of your spear.â€

â€œI never tilt against beauty,â€ he said, with a wave of his hand.

â€œThat is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too much.â€

â€œHow can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be
beautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready
than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.â€

â€œUgliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?â€ cried the duchess.
â€œWhat becomes of your simile about the orchid?â€

â€œUgliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good
Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly
virtues have made our England what she is.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t like your country, then?â€ she asked.

â€œI live in it.â€

â€œThat you may censure it the better.â€

â€œWould you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?â€ he inquired.

â€œWhat do they say of us?â€

â€œThat Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.â€

â€œIs that yours, Harry?â€

â€œI give it to you.â€

â€œI could not use it. It is too true.â€

â€œYou need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.â€

â€œThey are practical.â€

â€œThey are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,
they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.â€

â€œStill, we have done great things.â€

â€œGreat things have been thrust on us, Gladys.â€

â€œWe have carried their burden.â€

â€œOnly as far as the Stock Exchange.â€

She shook her head. â€œI believe in the race,â€ she cried.

â€œIt represents the survival of the pushing.â€

â€œIt has development.â€

â€œDecay fascinates me more.â€

â€œWhat of art?â€ she asked.

â€œIt is a malady.â€

â€œLove?â€

â€œAn illusion.â€

â€œReligion?â€

â€œThe fashionable substitute for belief.â€

â€œYou are a sceptic.â€

â€œNever! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.â€

â€œWhat are you?â€

â€œTo define is to limit.â€

â€œGive me a clue.â€

â€œThreads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.â€

â€œYou bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.â€

â€œOur host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince
Charming.â€

â€œAh! donâ€™t remind me of that,â€ cried Dorian Gray.

â€œOur host is rather horrid this evening,â€ answered the duchess,
colouring. â€œI believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely
scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern
butterfly.â€

â€œWell, I hope he wonâ€™t stick pins into you, Duchess,â€ laughed Dorian.

â€œOh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.â€

â€œAnd what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?â€

â€œFor the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I
come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by
half-past eight.â€

â€œHow unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.â€

â€œI darenâ€™t, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the
one I wore at Lady Hilstoneâ€™s garden-party? You donâ€™t, but it is nice
of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All
good hats are made out of nothing.â€

â€œLike all good reputations, Gladys,â€ interrupted Lord Henry. â€œEvery
effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be
a mediocrity.â€

â€œNot with women,â€ said the duchess, shaking her head; â€œand women rule
the world. I assure you we canâ€™t bear mediocrities. We women, as some
one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if
you ever love at all.â€

â€œIt seems to me that we never do anything else,â€ murmured Dorian.

â€œAh! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,â€ answered the duchess with
mock sadness.

â€œMy dear Gladys!â€ cried Lord Henry. â€œHow can you say that? Romance
lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.
Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.
Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely
intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best,
and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as
possible.â€

â€œEven when one has been wounded by it, Harry?â€ asked the duchess after
a pause.

â€œEspecially when one has been wounded by it,â€ answered Lord Henry.

The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression
in her eyes. â€œWhat do you say to that, Mr. Gray?â€ she inquired.

Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed.
â€œI always agree with Harry, Duchess.â€

â€œEven when he is wrong?â€

â€œHarry is never wrong, Duchess.â€

â€œAnd does his philosophy make you happy?â€

â€œI have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have
searched for pleasure.â€

â€œAnd found it, Mr. Gray?â€

â€œOften. Too often.â€

The duchess sighed. â€œI am searching for peace,â€ she said, â€œand if I
donâ€™t go and dress, I shall have none this evening.â€

â€œLet me get you some orchids, Duchess,â€ cried Dorian, starting to his
feet and walking down the conservatory.

â€œYou are flirting disgracefully with him,â€ said Lord Henry to his
cousin. â€œYou had better take care. He is very fascinating.â€

â€œIf he were not, there would be no battle.â€

â€œGreek meets Greek, then?â€

â€œI am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.â€

â€œThey were defeated.â€

â€œThere are worse things than capture,â€ she answered.

â€œYou gallop with a loose rein.â€

â€œPace gives life,â€ was the _riposte_.

â€œI shall write it in my diary to-night.â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œThat a burnt child loves the fire.â€

â€œI am not even singed. My wings are untouched.â€

â€œYou use them for everything, except flight.â€

â€œCourage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.â€

â€œYou have a rival.â€

â€œWho?â€

He laughed. â€œLady Narborough,â€ he whispered. â€œShe perfectly adores
him.â€

â€œYou fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us
who are romanticists.â€

â€œRomanticists! You have all the methods of science.â€

â€œMen have educated us.â€

â€œBut not explained you.â€

â€œDescribe us as a sex,â€ was her challenge.

â€œSphinxes without secrets.â€

She looked at him, smiling. â€œHow long Mr. Gray is!â€ she said. â€œLet us
go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.â€

â€œAh! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.â€

â€œThat would be a premature surrender.â€

â€œRomantic art begins with its climax.â€

â€œI must keep an opportunity for retreat.â€

â€œIn the Parthian manner?â€

â€œThey found safety in the desert. I could not do that.â€

â€œWomen are not always allowed a choice,â€ he answered, but hardly had he
finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came
a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody
started up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in
his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian
Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.

He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of
the sofas. After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with
a dazed expression.

â€œWhat has happened?â€ he asked. â€œOh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?â€
He began to tremble.

â€œMy dear Dorian,â€ answered Lord Henry, â€œyou merely fainted. That was
all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to
dinner. I will take your place.â€

â€œNo, I will come down,â€ he said, struggling to his feet. â€œI would
rather come down. I must not be alone.â€

He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of
gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of
terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the
window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the
face of James Vane watching him.




CHAPTER XVIII.


The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the
time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet
indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,
tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but
tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against
the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild
regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailorâ€™s face
peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to
lay its hand upon his heart.

But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of
the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual
life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the
imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of
sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen
brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor
the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon
the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round
the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers. Had
any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have
reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vaneâ€™s brother had
not come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in
some winter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did
not know who he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had
saved him.

And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think
that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them
visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would
his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from
silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear
as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!
As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and
the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a
wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere
memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back
to him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and
swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in
at six oâ€™clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.

It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was
something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that
seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it
was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused
the change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish
that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle
and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions
must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves
die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows
that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had
convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken
imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity
and not a little of contempt.

After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden
and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp
frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue
metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.

At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey
Clouston, the duchessâ€™s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of
his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the
mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken
and rough undergrowth.

â€œHave you had good sport, Geoffrey?â€ he asked.

â€œNot very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the
open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new
ground.â€

Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and
red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters
ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that
followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful
freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high
indifference of joy.

Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front
of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it
forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir
Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the
animalâ€™s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he
cried out at once, â€œDonâ€™t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.â€

â€œWhat nonsense, Dorian!â€ laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded
into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a
hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is
worse.

â€œGood heavens! I have hit a beater!â€ exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. â€œWhat an
ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!â€ he
called out at the top of his voice. â€œA man is hurt.â€

The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.

â€œWhere, sir? Where is he?â€ he shouted. At the same time, the firing
ceased along the line.

â€œHere,â€ answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.
â€œWhy on earth donâ€™t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the
day.â€

Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the
lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging
a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It
seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir
Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of
the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with
faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of
voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the
boughs overhead.

After a few momentsâ€”that were to him, in his perturbed state, like
endless hours of painâ€”he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started
and looked round.

â€œDorian,â€ said Lord Henry, â€œI had better tell them that the shooting is
stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.â€

â€œI wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,â€ he answered bitterly. â€œThe
whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?â€

He could not finish the sentence.

â€œI am afraid so,â€ rejoined Lord Henry. â€œHe got the whole charge of shot
in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go
home.â€

They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly
fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and
said, with a heavy sigh, â€œIt is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.â€

â€œWhat is?â€ asked Lord Henry. â€œOh! this accident, I suppose. My dear
fellow, it canâ€™t be helped. It was the manâ€™s own fault. Why did he get
in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather
awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It
makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he
shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.â€

Dorian shook his head. â€œIt is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something
horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,â€ he
added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.

The elder man laughed. â€œThe only horrible thing in the world is
_ennui_, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.
But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep
chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the
subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an
omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel
for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have
everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would
not be delighted to change places with you.â€

â€œThere is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Donâ€™t
laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who
has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is
the coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to
wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! donâ€™t you see a man
moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?â€

Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand
was pointing. â€œYes,â€ he said, smiling, â€œI see the gardener waiting for
you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the
table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must
come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.â€

Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The
man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating
manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. â€œHer
Grace told me to wait for an answer,â€ he murmured.

Dorian put the letter into his pocket. â€œTell her Grace that I am coming
in,â€ he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the
direction of the house.

â€œHow fond women are of doing dangerous things!â€ laughed Lord Henry. â€œIt
is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt
with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.â€

â€œHow fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present
instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I
donâ€™t love her.â€

â€œAnd the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you
are excellently matched.â€

â€œYou are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for
scandal.â€

â€œThe basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,â€ said Lord Henry,
lighting a cigarette.

â€œYou would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.â€

â€œThe world goes to the altar of its own accord,â€ was the answer.

â€œI wish I could love,â€ cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in
his voice. â€œBut I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the
desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has
become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was
silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to
Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.â€

â€œSafe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what
it is? You know I would help you.â€

â€œI canâ€™t tell you, Harry,â€ he answered sadly. â€œAnd I dare say it is
only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a
horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.â€

â€œWhat nonsense!â€

â€œI hope it is, but I canâ€™t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,
looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,
Duchess.â€

â€œI have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,â€ she answered. â€œPoor Geoffrey is
terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.
How curious!â€

â€œYes, it was very curious. I donâ€™t know what made me say it. Some whim,
I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am
sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.â€

â€œIt is an annoying subject,â€ broke in Lord Henry. â€œIt has no
psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on
purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one
who had committed a real murder.â€

â€œHow horrid of you, Harry!â€ cried the duchess. â€œIsnâ€™t it, Mr. Gray?
Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.â€

Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. â€œIt is nothing,
Duchess,â€ he murmured; â€œmy nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is
all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didnâ€™t hear what
Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think
I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, wonâ€™t you?â€

They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the
conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,
Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.
â€œAre you very much in love with him?â€ he asked.

She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. â€œI
wish I knew,â€ she said at last.

He shook his head. â€œKnowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty
that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.â€

â€œOne may lose oneâ€™s way.â€

â€œAll ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.â€

â€œWhat is that?â€

â€œDisillusion.â€

â€œIt was my _dÃ©but_ in life,â€ she sighed.

â€œIt came to you crowned.â€

â€œI am tired of strawberry leaves.â€

â€œThey become you.â€

â€œOnly in public.â€

â€œYou would miss them,â€ said Lord Henry.

â€œI will not part with a petal.â€

â€œMonmouth has ears.â€

â€œOld age is dull of hearing.â€

â€œHas he never been jealous?â€

â€œI wish he had been.â€

He glanced about as if in search of something. â€œWhat are you looking
for?â€ she inquired.

â€œThe button from your foil,â€ he answered. â€œYou have dropped it.â€

She laughed. â€œI have still the mask.â€

â€œIt makes your eyes lovelier,â€ was his reply.

She laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet
fruit.

Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror
in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become too
hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky
beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to
pre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at what Lord
Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.

At five oâ€™clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to
pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham
at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another
night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there in
the sunlight. The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.

Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to
town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in
his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to
the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see
him. He frowned and bit his lip. â€œSend him in,â€ he muttered, after some
momentsâ€™ hesitation.

As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a
drawer and spread it out before him.

â€œI suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this
morning, Thornton?â€ he said, taking up a pen.

â€œYes, sir,â€ answered the gamekeeper.

â€œWas the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?â€
asked Dorian, looking bored. â€œIf so, I should not like them to be left
in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.â€

â€œWe donâ€™t know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of
coming to you about.â€

â€œDonâ€™t know who he is?â€ said Dorian, listlessly. â€œWhat do you mean?
Wasnâ€™t he one of your men?â€

â€œNo, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir.â€

The pen dropped from Dorian Grayâ€™s hand, and he felt as if his heart
had suddenly stopped beating. â€œA sailor?â€ he cried out. â€œDid you say a
sailor?â€

â€œYes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on
both arms, and that kind of thing.â€

â€œWas there anything found on him?â€ said Dorian, leaning forward and
looking at the man with startled eyes. â€œAnything that would tell his
name?â€

â€œSome money, sirâ€”not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any
kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we
think.â€

Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He
clutched at it madly. â€œWhere is the body?â€ he exclaimed. â€œQuick! I must
see it at once.â€

â€œIt is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk donâ€™t like to
have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings bad
luck.â€

â€œThe Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to
bring my horse round. No. Never mind. Iâ€™ll go to the stables myself. It
will save time.â€

In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the
long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him
in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his
path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.
He lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air
like an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs.

At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.
He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the
farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him
that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand
upon the latch.

There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a
discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the
door open and entered.

On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man
dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted
handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a
bottle, sputtered beside it.

Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take
the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to
come to him.

â€œTake that thing off the face. I wish to see it,â€ he said, clutching at
the door-post for support.

When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of joy
broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James
Vane.

He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode
home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.




CHAPTER XIX.


â€œThere is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,â€ cried
Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled
with rose-water. â€œYou are quite perfect. Pray, donâ€™t change.â€

Dorian Gray shook his head. â€œNo, Harry, I have done too many dreadful
things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good
actions yesterday.â€

â€œWhere were you yesterday?â€

â€œIn the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.â€

â€œMy dear boy,â€ said Lord Henry, smiling, â€œanybody can be good in the
country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people
who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not
by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by
which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being
corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they
stagnate.â€

â€œCulture and corruption,â€ echoed Dorian. â€œI have known something of
both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found
together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I
have altered.â€

â€œYou have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you
had done more than one?â€ asked his companion as he spilled into his
plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a
perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.

â€œI can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else.
I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She
was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was
that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, donâ€™t you?
How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of
course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I
am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we
have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a
week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept
tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone
away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her
as flowerlike as I had found her.â€

â€œI should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill
of real pleasure, Dorian,â€ interrupted Lord Henry. â€œBut I can finish
your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That
was the beginning of your reformation.â€

â€œHarry, you are horrible! You mustnâ€™t say these dreadful things.
Hettyâ€™s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But
there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her
garden of mint and marigold.â€

â€œAnd weep over a faithless Florizel,â€ said Lord Henry, laughing, as he
leaned back in his chair. â€œMy dear Dorian, you have the most curiously
boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now
with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to
a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met
you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will
be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much
of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides,
how do you know that Hetty isnâ€™t floating at the present moment in some
starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?â€

â€œI canâ€™t bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the
most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I donâ€™t care what
you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I
rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window,
like a spray of jasmine. Donâ€™t let us talk about it any more, and donâ€™t
try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years,
the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a
sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me
something about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to
the club for days.â€

â€œThe people are still discussing poor Basilâ€™s disappearance.â€

â€œI should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,â€ said
Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.

â€œMy dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and
the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having
more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate
lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbellâ€™s
suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.
Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left
for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor
Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris
at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has
been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who
disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful
city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.â€

â€œWhat do you think has happened to Basil?â€ asked Dorian, holding up his
Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could
discuss the matter so calmly.

â€œI have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is
no business of mine. If he is dead, I donâ€™t want to think about him.
Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.â€

â€œWhy?â€ said the younger man wearily.

â€œBecause,â€ said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt
trellis of an open vinaigrette box, â€œone can survive everything
nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the
nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee
in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with
whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was
very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her. Of course,
married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the
loss even of oneâ€™s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most.
They are such an essential part of oneâ€™s personality.â€

Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next
room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white
and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he
stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, â€œHarry, did it ever
occur to you that Basil was murdered?â€

Lord Henry yawned. â€œBasil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury
watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to
have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a
man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was
really rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he
told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you
were the dominant motive of his art.â€

â€œI was very fond of Basil,â€ said Dorian with a note of sadness in his
voice. â€œBut donâ€™t people say that he was murdered?â€

â€œOh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all
probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not
the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his
chief defect.â€

â€œWhat would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?â€
said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had spoken.

â€œI would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that
doesnâ€™t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.
It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your
vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs
exclusively to the lower orders. I donâ€™t blame them in the smallest
degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply
a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.â€

â€œA method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who
has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?
Donâ€™t tell me that.â€

â€œOh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,â€ cried Lord
Henry, laughing. â€œThat is one of the most important secrets of life. I
should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should
never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us
pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a
really romantic end as you suggest, but I canâ€™t. I dare say he fell
into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the
scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on
his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating
over him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I donâ€™t
think he would have done much more good work. During the last ten years
his painting had gone off very much.â€

Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began
to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged
bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo
perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of
crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards
and forwards.

â€œYes,â€ he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of
his pocket; â€œhis painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have
lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be
great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated
you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. Itâ€™s a habit
bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he
did of you? I donâ€™t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh!
I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to
Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way. You never got
it back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted
to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basilâ€™s best period. Since
then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good
intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative
British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.â€

â€œI forget,â€ said Dorian. â€œI suppose I did. But I never really liked it.
I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me. Why
do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some
playâ€”Hamlet, I thinkâ€”how do they run?â€”

â€œLike the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart.â€


Yes: that is what it was like.â€

Lord Henry laughed. â€œIf a man treats life artistically, his brain is
his heart,â€ he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.

Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.
â€œâ€˜Like the painting of a sorrow,â€™â€ he repeated, â€œâ€˜a face without a
heart.â€™â€

The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. â€œBy the
way, Dorian,â€ he said after a pause, â€œâ€˜what does it profit a man if he
gain the whole world and loseâ€”how does the quotation run?â€”his own
soulâ€™?â€

The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.
â€œWhy do you ask me that, Harry?â€

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,
â€œI asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.
That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the
Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people
listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the
man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being
rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A
wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly
white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful
phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lipsâ€”it was really very
good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet
that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he
would not have understood me.â€

â€œDonâ€™t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and
sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is
a soul in each one of us. I know it.â€

â€œDo you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?â€

â€œQuite sure.â€

â€œAh! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely
certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the
lesson of romance. How grave you are! Donâ€™t be so serious. What have
you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up
our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,
and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your
youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you
are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful,
Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You
remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy,
and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in
appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth
I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early,
or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. Itâ€™s absurd to talk
of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen
now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in
front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the
aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask
them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly
give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks,
believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that
thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca,
with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against
the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that
there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Donâ€™t stop. I want
music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I
am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that
even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is
old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.
Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You
have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against
your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been to
you no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are
still the same.â€

â€œI am not the same, Harry.â€

â€œYes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.
Donâ€™t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.
Donâ€™t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need
not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, donâ€™t deceive
yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question
of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides
itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and
think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a
morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that
brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you
had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had
ceased to playâ€”I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that
our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own
senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of
_lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the
strangest month of my life over again. I wish I could change places
with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has
always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of
what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am
so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or
painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has
been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your
sonnets.â€

Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.
â€œYes, life has been exquisite,â€ he murmured, â€œbut I am not going to
have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant
things to me. You donâ€™t know everything about me. I think that if you
did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Donâ€™t laugh.â€

â€œWhy have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne
over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the
dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she
will come closer to the earth. You wonâ€™t? Let us go to the club, then.
It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is
some one at Whiteâ€™s who wants immensely to know youâ€”young Lord Poole,
Bournemouthâ€™s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has
begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather
reminds me of you.â€

â€œI hope not,â€ said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. â€œBut I am tired
to-night, Harry. I shanâ€™t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I
want to go to bed early.â€

â€œDo stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was
something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than
I had ever heard from it before.â€

â€œIt is because I am going to be good,â€ he answered, smiling. â€œI am a
little changed already.â€

â€œYou cannot change to me, Dorian,â€ said Lord Henry. â€œYou and I will
always be friends.â€

â€œYet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.
Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It
does harm.â€

â€œMy dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be
going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people
against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too
delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we
are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,
there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It
annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that
the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.
That is all. But we wonâ€™t discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I
am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you
to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and
wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.
Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she
never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you
would be. Her clever tongue gets on oneâ€™s nerves. Well, in any case, be
here at eleven.â€

â€œMust I really come, Harry?â€

â€œCertainly. The park is quite lovely now. I donâ€™t think there have been
such lilacs since the year I met you.â€

â€œVery well. I shall be here at eleven,â€ said Dorian. â€œGood night,
Harry.â€ As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had
something more to say. Then he sighed and went out.




CHAPTER XX.


It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and
did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home,
smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He
heard one of them whisper to the other, â€œThat is Dorian Gray.â€ He
remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared
at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the
charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that
no one knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to
love him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her
once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that
wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she
had!â€”just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her
cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had
everything that he had lost.

When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent
him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and
began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.

Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing
for the unstained purity of his boyhoodâ€”his rose-white boyhood, as Lord
Henry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled
his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had
been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in
being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been
the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.
But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?

Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that
the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the
unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to
that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure
swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not
â€œForgive us our sinsâ€ but â€œSmite us for our iniquitiesâ€ should be the
prayer of man to a most just God.

The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many
years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids
laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night
of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and
with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some
one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending
with these idolatrous words: â€œThe world is changed because you are made
of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.â€ The
phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to
himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the
floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his
beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed
for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from
stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.
What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow
moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had
spoiled him.

It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It
was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane
was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had
shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the
secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was,
over Basil Hallwardâ€™s disappearance would soon pass away. It was
already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the
death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the
living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the
portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It
was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him
that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The
murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,
his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was
nothing to him.

A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for.
Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at
any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.

As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in
the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it
had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel
every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had
already gone away. He would go and look.

He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the
door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face
and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and
the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror
to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.

He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and
dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and
indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the
eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of
the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsomeâ€”more loathsome, if
possible, than beforeâ€”and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed
brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it
been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the
desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking
laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things
finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the
red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a
horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the
painted feet, as though the thing had drippedâ€”blood even on the hand
that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to
confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt
that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would
believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.
Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned
what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.
They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his
duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.
There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well
as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had
told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of
Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty
Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he
was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing
more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At
least he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing
more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the
mask of goodness. For curiosityâ€™s sake he had tried the denial of self.
He recognized that now.

But this murderâ€”was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be
burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only
one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itselfâ€”that was
evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had
given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had
felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been
away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon
it. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had
marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it
had been conscience. He would destroy it.

He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He
had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was
bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill
the painterâ€™s work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,
and when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous
soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He
seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.

There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its
agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.
Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked
up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and
brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no
answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all
dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and
watched.

â€œWhose house is that, Constable?â€ asked the elder of the two gentlemen.

â€œMr. Dorian Grayâ€™s, sir,â€ answered the policeman.

They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of
them was Sir Henry Ashtonâ€™s uncle.

Inside, in the servantsâ€™ part of the house, the half-clad domestics
were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying
and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.

After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the
footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They
called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force
the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The
windows yielded easilyâ€”their bolts were old.

When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait
of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his
exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in
evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,
and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings
that they recognized who it was.

CHAPTER I.

THE COUSINS.

On an evening in summer before the late siege of Paris, three
ladies--one a matron of mature years, the other two both young and
handsome girls, a brunette and a blonde--were seated in one of the
lofty windows of a stately room on the first _Ã©tage_ of the Grand
Hotel Royal, which immediately overlooks the Rhine at Cologne.

The senior of these--Adelaide, Countess of Frankenburg, a woman
grey-haired now, and with features somewhat of the heavy German
type--had just received a letter, and was intent upon it, while her
daughter Ernestine, and her orphan niece Herminia, watched her face
with interest, and forgot the little Tauchnitz editions over which
they had been idling.

'What does my brother Heinrich say?' asked Ernestine.

'That he has got extended leave of absence from Potsdam, and next
week will arrive at Frankenburg, to spend some time with us.  He
brings with him a young English friend, Carl Pierrepont, an officer
of his regiment.  I trust, Herminia, you will receive my dear boy
with all the affection he so justly merits.'

But Herminia made no reply, so the Countess repeated what she had
said, and fixed her eyes steadily and inquiringly upon her.  She only
sighed, opened, and then tossed aside her Tauchnitz edition of an
English novel.  The Countess's ideas of propriety would not permit
her to allow her girls to peruse any other light literature; but
having an idea that a married woman might read works of a
higher-flavoured nature, she sometimes read the works of MM. Dumas
and De Kock, to 'keep up her French,' as she phrased it

The cousins--known as 'the Belles of Frankenburg'--were alike in
stature and delicacy, but very dissimilar in style of beauty and in
complexion.  Herminia was dazzlingly fair, of a pure Saxon type, with
hair of that lovely brown tint which seems shot with gold in the
sunshine, and soft eyes of violet-blue, that seemed almost black at
night, and though brown her tresses, and wondrously fair her skin,
her eyelashes and eyebrows were dark, almost black; but her pretty
little nose bordered rather on the _retroussÃ©_.

Ernestine was a dark beauty, with black hair and clear, but
thoughtful and dreamy hazel eyes, which she inherited with the blood
of some Hungarian ancestor; her whole style was more classic than
that of her cousin.  Her nose was slightly aquiline, with dark
straight eyebrows that nearly met over it, imparting a great degree
of character to her face, which was suggestive of decision of mind
and firmness of purpose--a little self-willed and opinionated,
perhaps; for Ernestine was not without her faults.  She was fond of
admiration; but what pretty girl is not?  She liked dress and gaiety,
and would dance all night if her partners pleased her.

The Countess carefully folded her son's letter, and fixing her keen
grey eyes on Herminia, said, somewhat sententiously:

'Though an old man now, the father of my Heinrich was as brave a
soldier as ever trod the soil of Germany, and his name is yet
venerated among the Uhlans of the Archduke; and I am proud to say,
Herminia, that his son is worthy of such a father.'

'Were my cousin the Archduke himself,' said Herminia, wearily, for
she was pretty well used to hear these encomiums, 'he would be
totally indifferent to me.'

'Herminia!'

'Totally, I repeat.  Pardon me, dear Aunt Adelaide; but he has no
particular claim on my regard.'

'He is your cousin, your own blood relation--near almost as a
brother!' said the Countess, impatiently.

'But still, mamma, as I have said a hundred times before, he can have
no claim upon her hand,' urged Ernestine, who had not yet spoken on
the subject.

'Do you, Grafine, wish to abet Herminia in her strange contumacy?'
asked the Countess, severely.

'I speak but my thoughts, dearest mamma.'

'Her father, the Staats Rath, gave her away to him as a child; but
you, as well as I do, know the arrangement made by our family; they
were betrothed when she was in her cradle, and he a schoolboy at
Bonn; and now he comes to claim her hand, in virtue of that
betrothal,' added the Countess, who, though a German, had
considerable nobility and dignity in her bearing and aspect.

'Such foolish arrangements may have been made long ago, Aunt
Adelaide, when robber-barons lived in those ruined castles which look
down from every rock upon the Rhine; but such would be absurd in
these days of ours, when its waters are ploughed up by steamers, and
the lurlies and elves have all been put to flight.'

'Herminia,' said the Countess, with increasing severity, 'do you
revere the memory of the Baron and Privy Councillor your father?'

'I do, indeed, Aunt Adelaide; my father's memory is very dear to me,
even as that of my dead mother, whom I never saw,' replied the girl,
with her eyes growing moist; 'but I decline to admit the right of
either to give me, while yet a helpless child, away to anyone in
marriage.  The idea is eccentric; it is more, it is odious and
preposterous!'

'You use somewhat strong language, Grafine.'

'Surely not stronger than the situation merits?' replied Herminia,
her soft voice trembling with agitation and annoyance.  'If my cousin
Heinrich is unmanly enough to insist upon the fulfilment of this most
absurd family compact, I shall ever deem him most unworthy of my
regard, or, indeed, that of any woman!' added Herminia, whose tears
now began to fall.

'Then it is your resolution to violate, to trample upon, to utterly
disregard the affectionate contract made by your parents and by his?'

'But I have never seen this--this most tiresome cousin, Aunt
Adelaide!'

'That has been a misfortune caused by your being educated in England,
while he was at the university, and then with the army.'

'Hence he is to me a stranger, and must be greeted and received as
such.'

'I think my brother Heinrich is acting foolishly in bringing the
English friend (of whom he writes so frequently) to Frankenburg,'
said Ernestine.

'Why?' asked the Countess.

'Because Herminia, in the very spirit of opposition, may fall in love
with _him_.'

'My father could not have taken a surer way to make me shun and
loathe my cousin, and even do something more dreadful still, than by
forming this arrangement.'

'Something more dreadful still!' repeated the Countess, raising her
voice, and surveying her niece through her gold eyeglass.  'In
Heaven's name, what _do_ you mean, Herminia?'

'By compelling me to marry a man I don't love; for what happiness
could follow a union with a total stranger?  Besides, I don't want to
marry.'

'Your own cousin a stranger?' persisted the Countess.  'But though we
have discussed this subject a thousand times before, there is one
feature in it to which I have never referred, and which,
consequently, will be _new_ to you.'

'I am glad to hear _that_,' replied the contumacious little beauty,
shrugging her pretty shoulders and almost yawning.

'I mean a clause in your father's will, by which, if you do not marry
our Heinrich, your fortune will be divided between him and your
cousin Ernestine,--leaving you, in fact, without a silver groschen.'

'I would not have a kreutzer of it--neither, I am sure, would
Heinrich!' exclaimed Ernestine, emphatically.

'Neither of you would be consulted in the matter.  But now, Herminia,
will you brave the prospect of poverty--a life of utter
dependence--go back to England as a governess, perhaps?'

'Yes,' said the girl proudly; 'I would brave anything.'

'You love some one else!' exclaimed her aunt.

'I have never said so,' replied Herminia, with a perceptible tremor
in her sweet voice; 'but no doubt it is this fortune of which you
speak that Heinrich wants.'

'Did he want it when you were in your cradle, and he was carrying his
satchel at Bonn?'

'I should think not; but he may want it now, after some years spent
in the army.'

'Shame! you forget yourself, Herminia--forget that you speak of your
own cousin--of _my_ son.  It is much more likely that some
adventurous friend, some acquaintance, whom you have picked up here
is thinking of your fortune, than my dear Heinrich.'

The old lady's eyes were actually filled with tears, and after a
pause she said:

'I regret, Herminia, that I ever sent you to England.'

'Why, dearest aunt?'

'Because those English girls, your school companions there, have
indoctrinated you with preposterous ideas of female
independence--right of choice, and so forth; and now that I think of
it, _who_ is that gentleman with whom you waltz so frequently?'

'Waltz, aunt?' said the girl, in a low voice.

'And who gave you, last night, that rose which you now wear in your
breast?'

'Last night, aunt?' faltered Herminia, now blushing deeply, while
Ernestine laughed mischievously.

'Don't repeat my words, please.  Yes, last night, when the band of
the Uhlans was playing in the garden of the Prinz Carl?'

'Herr Ludwig Mansfeld.'

'And how came you to know him?' asked the Countess, severely, adding,
'I hope he is not an officer from the barracks?'

(Such dreadful fellows 'those officers from the barracks' seem to be
all the world over, from Canterbury to Cabul!)

'I met him first at a ball in the Kaiserlicher Hof, where the Master
of the Ceremonies introduced him to me when you were playing cards in
the ante-room.  We dance frequently; and the introduction was
unnecessary, according to our German ideas.'

'In--deed!'

'Is there any harm in all that when he dances so delightfully?

'And oh, how handsome he is!' exclaimed Ernestine.

'I fear some harm has been done already; and I do not think that any
gentleman should dance with a young lady before he has obtained the
permission of her chaperone.'

There was now a pause, after which the Countess said:

'The Count urges our return before Heinrich arrives; so we shall take
the train to Aix-la-Chapelle to-morrow.'

'So very soon, aunt?' said Herminia, growing pale.

'My dear, I am sorry to spoil your pleasure here; but to-morrow
morning _we go_,' said the Countess, rising haughtily; 'come with me,
Ernestine.  I need your assistance with my correspondence.'

The mother and daughter swept out of the room, their dresses--the
rustling moirÃ© of the Countess and the maize-coloured silk of
Ernestine--gliding noiselessly over the varnished floor, and Herminia
was left to her own sad reflections.

'Ich bin sehr bÃ¶se!' (I am very angry) she heard the Countess
exclaim, as the door closed, and then she heard her cousin make some
laughing response.

'How can Ernestine be so heartless?' thought the girl; 'but, alas!
she knows not what love is!  To-morrow,' she exclaimed
aloud--'to-morrow, I shall lose him, and perhaps for ever, my dear,
dear Ludwig!'

Her handsome eyes were now welling over with hot, salt tears.  She
had her arms above her head, with her white slender fingers
interlaced amid the coils of her beautiful brown hair; her eyes were
cast mournfully upward; then she tore her fairy fingers asunder with
a sob in her throat and let her hands drop by her side as she sank
back in her chair.

'Would to Heaven that I had never known him--that we had never, never
come to Cologne,' she exclaimed.

She felt that she must see Ludwig once again; but this dreadful
cousin, how was he to be avoided?

These two ideas filled her whole soul as she sat, silent and
motionless, looking out on the view that lay before the hotel
windows: the broad waters of the famous Rhine, shining redly in the
light of the setting sun, covered with sailing vessels and steamers
shooting to and fro, its great pontoon bridge, through which the
current surged, the wilderness of roofs that formed the city--that
Rome of the north which Petrarch apostrophized to Colonna--stretching
far away, with the great masses of the unfinished cathedral, the dome
of St. Gereon, with its three galleries, and the stately tower of St.
Cunibert rising high in the air and casting mighty shadows eastward.
But Herminia surveyed them all as one who was in a dream, and kept
repeating to herself, as she drew the rose from her breast and
pressed it to her trembling lips with all a young girl's fervour:

'Yes--yes--I must see him once again, and then all will be over--over
for ever!'

She glanced at her watch, took her hat and gloves from a console
table close by, and hastily and noiselessly quitted the room.
Descending the great staircase of the hotel, she issued into the
beautiful garden attached to it, and proceeded at once to a certain
fountain, near which a gentleman was lingering.  He hurried towards
her, and took both her tremulous little hands within his own.  He
gazed tenderly into her eyes, and then scanned the windows of the
hotel.  Alas! too many overlooked them, so the longed-for kiss was
neither given nor taken; and neither knew that at this very time,
they were both seen by the Countess and the laughing Ernestine.

Though in plain clothes, attired as a civilian, the soldier-like air
of Ludwig Mansfeld would not conceal.  He was dark-complexioned,
especially for a German, with straight handsome features.  He was
closely shaven, all save a thick moustache, and he had tender brown
eyes--tender, at least, when they looked into those of Herminia, who
was now weeping freely.

'Tears?' said he, inquiringly.

'Yes, Ludwig, tears; I have much reason for them.'

'How, darling?

'We leave Cologne to-morrow.'

'Ah! why so soon?'

'It is the resolve of my aunt.'

'And for where, darling?'

'Aix-la-Chapelle.'

Her lover's features brightened as she said this.

'Well, my own one, I shall be there in a few days,' he whispered
cheerfully; 'and if we are prudent, and watch well our opportunities,
it will indeed be a very remarkable thing if we don't meet as often
as we may desire.'

'But my cousin--this most odious _fiancÃ©_--Heinrich von Frankenburg,
joins us in a week from Potsdam, where, I understand, his regiment is
stationed.'

'I have seen Frankenburg, and know that he has the reputation of
being dangerously handsome; but I thought he was on leave of absence?'

'So he has been.  As for Aunt Adelaide, she is a tyrant, and I do
believe would keep me in pinafores, if she could!' said Herminia
bitterly.

'Herminia, dearest,' said the young man, while gazing at her
lovingly, earnestly, and very keenly, 'you have never seen this
wondrous cousin, to whom your family wish to assign you like a bale
of goods?'

'Oh, never even once, Ludwig; and to me he is an object of
abhorrence!' she exclaimed passionately.

'Excuse me, my love,' said Ludwig sadly; 'but I have a strange
foreboding--a presentiment which comes to me unbidden, and seems to
say that when you _do_ see him, your present abhorrence may pass
away, and--and a tender emotion take its place.  The propinquity and
charms given to a cousin are perilous for a secret lover like me.'

Herminia now wept bitterly.

'Ludwig, I could quarrel with you for such a cruel suspicion,' she
sobbed out, 'but that we are, I fear me, now speaking together for
the--the--the last time,' and, heedless of who might see the action,
in the abandonment of her great grief, her head sank on his shoulder,
and she nestled her sweet face in his neck.

'Your tears, my own darling,' said he, 'are a rebuke, and more than a
sufficient rebuke, for my suspicion; and bitter, indeed, would this
parting-time have been to me, but for the knowledge--the sure
conviction--that, even if a thousand cousins came, still we shall
meet at Aix.'

Herminia shook her head mournfully, and said, 'I pray to Heaven that
it may be so, and with the hope these words inspire, I must now,
dear, dear Ludwig, say--farewell!'

And so they parted, with hearts that doubtless were aching sorely,
for their future seemed dark and dubious.  Yet he seemed more hopeful
than her.  He kissed her very tenderly, and, though his naturally
brown cheek looked pale, she thought he smiled at their temporary
separation--if temporary it was to be--more than she could account
for.

But doubtless, lover-like, he had some bold plan in view.

'Yet it was a sad, sad smile my darling gave me,' thought the girl,
as, with her veil closely drawn, she slowly and wearily ascended the
great oak staircase to the _Ã©tage_ off which her bed-room opened;
'but no doubt he only thought of cheering me.'

Next morning the Countess's carriage took the trio to the
Eisenbahnhof for Aix-la-Chapelle; and as Herminia from the
swift-speeding train looked back to the sinking spires of Cologne, a
curtain seemed to have fallen between her past and present existence.

And oh! how weary was the night that followed, when tossing
restlessly, defiantly, and petulantly on her laced pillow, she lay in
broken slumber, with tears matting her long and lovely eyelashes.




CHAPTER II.

CHARLIE PIERREPONT.

A week after this, a drochski deposited a smart-looking young
officer, in the uniform of the 95th Thuringian regiment--blue with
red facings and silver epaulettes, spike-helmet and black belt--at
the entrance of the Pariser Hof of Cologne, a comfortable and
moderate hotel, suitable to that style of economy continental
military men are usually constrained to practise.

Though wearing the well-known uniform of the Prussian army, it was
impossible not to recognize in the new arrival, as he sprang lightly
up the steps of the hotel, that he was an Englishman, a genuine
Briton, for he was the Carl Pierrepont mentioned by young Frankenburg
in his letter to the Countess.  Carl--or Charlie, as he was known
when he was wont to hold his wicket in the playing-grounds of Rugby
against the best bowler in the three hundred, and to con his studies
in the white brick Tudor school-house, or in the long avenue called
Addison's Walk--was a great favourite with all his regiment, and
already had the honour of being specially noticed on parade by our
Princess Royal when her husband was reviewing the Prussian troops,
and of receiving from his hand the much-coveted Iron Cross when
almost in his boyhood.

One great cause, perhaps, of Charlie's popularity among the
Thuringians was, that as an Englishman he was destitute of that
aristocratic hauteur which causes the well-born German officer to
regard all under his command as an inferior order of beings, a style
of bearing and sentiment unknown alike in the armies of Britain and
France.

His face was fair, his features handsome, and he was verging on
thirty years of age.  His character, like his figure, was fully
developed and formed; the expression of his eyes betokened
intelligence and promise; while his lithe and manly form had all that
muscular strength and activity that women often prefer to intellect
in men, and which is frequently the result of the out-door sports in
the playgrounds of Rugby, Eton, and Harrow, a portion of our English
system of education.

Though the son of a fox-hunting Warwickshire squire, who knew every
cover in Stoneleigh, the Brailes, and the Edgehills, the head of an
old but certainly embarrassed family, so far as mortgages and so
forth went, he was barely deemed among the wohlgeborn, according to
the Prussian standard; and poor Charlie had nothing as yet but his
epaulettes and sword, his pay as a soldier of Fortune, with the
privileges usually accorded to Continental officers, such as going
everywhere at half-price in virtue of their being in
uniform--privileges which ours would decline 'with thanks.'

Charlie Pierrepont was everywhere a great favourite with the other
sex; and perhaps there was no species of flirtation in which he was
not a skilled hand, and he had carefully studied the whole 'scale of
familiarities, the gamut of love,' as he was wont to call it, from a
touch of the hand or the elevation of an eyebrow, upward, to the
extremity of tenderness; and thus much of his time had been passed
pleasantly for some ten years in every garrison town between the Elbe
and the Vistula; but he had always come off scot-free, for he was
possessed, as we have said, of but his epaulettes and sword, while
many of the girls he met were as finished flirts as himself; and
some, after a short acquaintance, would show their hands with a
laugh, and, as it were, throw up their cards.

'Kellner! let me have a room on the lowest _Ã©tage_ that is
unoccupied,' said he, as his portmanteaus were carried in by the
hausknecht.

'Yes, mein Herr,' replied the oberkellner, or head-waiter.

'Is the young Count Von Frankenburg here--an officer of the
Thuringians?'

'Yes; he is now at the _table d'hÃ´te_.  The bell has just rung, so
mein Herr is exactly in time for dinner.'

'Very good.'

'This way, mein Herr,' said the waiter, bowing; 'but, though in the
Prussian uniform, I think the Herr is an Englishman.'

'How do you know that I am so?'

'Because I myself am one, and I recognized you by your voice.'

And, sooth to say, Charlie was very unlike a German in that respect,
and had the pleasantly modulated voice of a well-trained English
gentleman, and few voices are more agreeable to listen to.

He entered the stately speise-saal, or dining-hall of the hotel,
where the landlord, in the kindly German fashion, sat at the head of
the table, presiding over all his guests, more than a hundred in
number, and already the waiters were busy.  A single glance showed
Pierrepont where his comrade sat--a smart and handsome young officer
in undress uniform, who was caressing a dark moustache, and making
himself agreeable to a lady beside him.  He rose and beckoned to the
new arrival.

'Welcome to Cologne, Carl!'

'Thanks, Heinrich.  How are you?'

They shook hands simply, as Charlie had a genuine English repugnance
to salute a man in the German fashion on the cheek.  He then took the
chair which his friend, the Count, had reversed and placed against
the table, for service beside his own.

'Kellner! die speise-karte!'  The wine card was called for next, and
the serious business of the meal began, amid all that noise and
hubbub peculiar to a German _table d'hÃ´te_, where Counts and Barons,
with ribbons and orders, may be seen handling their knives and forks
like English ploughmen, and pretty frauleins tugging away at chicken
bones with the whitest of teeth, and the most perfect air of
self-possession.  The first conversation was, of course, about the
expected war concerning the Spanish succession, the political
sketches in the _Kladderadatch_, the official accounts in the _Staats
Anzeiger_; how all Paris was brimming over with enthusiasm, rage, and
vengeance; that crowds were always in the streets shouting, 'Down
with Prussia!' 'To the Rhine! to the Rhine!' 'To Berlin!'  How the
'Marseillaise' was being sung, and the hotel of the Prussian
ambassador was only saved from total destruction by the intervention
of the gendarmerie; for the time had now come when the Prussians
spoke exultingly of Leipzig, even as the French did of Jena, and also
raised the cry of 'To the Rhine!' while the national songs of the
Fatherland were constantly sung in hoarse but martial chorus.

Dinner over, the lighted candles came, as a hint for the ladies to
retire, and rising like a covey of partridges they withdrew.  The
cloth was removed, and fresh bottles of wine, or lager-beer, with
tobacco and cigars, were provided on all hands, and the conversation
became more general, and, if possible, more noisy than before.

As the subject of the coming war was discussed, many eyes were turned
to the two friends in the uniform of the 95th Thuringians, for both
seemed gentlemen and soldiers, and no troops in the world look more
like our own in bearing, and in firm, manly physique, than the
Prussians.  Charlie Pierrepont had acquired many of the ways of the
latter, and would join, when on the march, 'Was is des Deutschen
Vaterland,' as lustily as if his father had been some Rhenish Baron,
and not a hearty Warwickshire squire.

'I am already sick of this subject of the war,' said Charlie, as he
lingered over a cigar; 'one hears so much of it everywhere.  By the
way, have you yet seen your fair cousin, Heinrich?'

'Yes.'

'And found her charming?'

'Beyond my fondest hopes; but she knew not that I had seen her, nor,
in truth, did I care much to intrude upon her.'

'Intrude!--upon your intended?'

'That is the word,' said the Count, with a strange smile.

'Why, Herr Graf?'

'Don't "Herr Graf" me.  Call me Heinrich.'

'Well?'

'A deuced fellow, named Ludwig Mansfeld (I found it so in the
_Fremden Buch_, at the Grand Hotel), has cut me out--quite.'

'Have him out in another fashion, and I am the man to measure the
ground for you.'

'Thanks, Carl, but I would rather fire at my own figure in a mirror,'
said Frankenburg, laughing.

'You are sure your friends expect me at the Schloss?'

'Yes, at Frankenburg; they are familiar with your name there.  I have
written so often of you to Ernestine, my sister.'

'She was educated in England, I believe?'

'With Herminia at the west end of London; so you and she will get on
famously together.  As you are a musician, you will like her
immensely, Carl.'

'I have no doubt of that.'

Little indeed could poor Charlie Pierrepont foresee all Ernestine was
yet to be to him.

'I am a bad fellow, I fear,' said the Count reflectively; 'I have
trifled with too many women in my time, and fear that I am not worthy
of this sweet cousin of mine, even if she would have me.'

'Nay, nay, Heinrich----'

'Somebody writes, that "if we were all judged by our deservings,
there is scarcely a man on earth would find a woman _bad_ enough for
him."'

'That is taking a low estimate of mankind in general.'

'And of the 95th Thuringians in particular,' added the young Count,
laughing; 'to-morrow we shall start for Frankenburg in an open
britzka--it is only twenty-five miles from this; and now, one bottle
more of St. Julian, and then we shall go and see the girls at the
gardens of the Prinz Carl.'

'Half German and half French--some of them are, no doubt, very
pretty.'

'Nay, I hope they are wholly German now.  It was in those gardens I
first met my beautiful cousin, with that devil of a fellow, who,
somehow, got introduced to her.  Let us go then; the band of the 76th
Hanoverians plays there every evening.  This time to-morrow will find
us at dear old Frankenburg, where, as I shall have the girl all to
myself, I hope to turn the flank of this Herr Mansfeld.  I am in love
with my cousin--actually in love with her at last.'

'My simple comrade, of what are you talking?  Is this any age of the
world in which to wear your heart upon your sleeve?  Is this fellow
Mansfeld good-looking?'

'Rather,' said the Count, twirling the points of his moustaches, and
eyeing himself complacently in the depths of a great mirror opposite;
'but I wish I had your general success, Carl.'

'In what--I took honours in nothing at dear old Rugby.'

'Indeed--not even in flirtation?'

'In that I might have had the golden medal, had golden medals been
given for such excellence.'

They assumed their spike helmets and swords, which the Prussian
officers wear through a perforation in the left skirt, as their belt
is worn under the coat, and thus bantering each other, cigar in mouth
and arm-in-arm, they proceeded laughingly towards the crowded gardens
of the Prinz Carl Hotel.

Next day saw them off for Frankenburg in an open britzka.  The day
was a lovely one in summer, and the scenery around them grand.
Charlie, of course, apostrophized the Rhine, and quoted Byron.  They
passed DÃ¼ren and the valley of the Ruhr, with the picturesque hamlet
of Riedeggen perched on its lofty rock; MerodÃ©, the cradle of the
Merodeur; industrious Stolberg, with its chÃ¢teau crowning a hill, and
the beautiful wood named the Reichswald.

Young Frankenburg was in excellent spirits, and bantered the driver,
calling him schwager (brother-in-law), a singular title for
post-boys, and so forth, the origin of which is unknown.  He was
rather too liberal to him in the matter of trinkgeld (drink money);
thus the britzka was driven at a thundering rate down that basin of
beautiful hills which surround Aix, while Heinrich waved his
forage-cap, and sung verses from the war-song of Arndt:

  'My own Fatherland, my brave Germany on!
    We'll sing them a terrible strain.
  For what ages ago, their vile policy won--
    Of Strasburg, of Metz, and Lorraine.
  They shall hand it all back to the uttermost mite,
  Since for life or for death they compel us to fight.
  To shout, "To the Rhine, to the Rhine, and advance!
  All Germany onward, and march into France!"'




CHAPTER III.

THE DREADED MEETING.

A week had passed away at Frankenburg, and the subject of the young
Count's return--that event so dreaded by poor Herminia, from motives
of delicacy, perhaps--had not been resumed, till the evening which
saw him and his comrade driving through the beautiful scenery just
referred to.

Dinner had been delayed, as the Count had telegraphed from the
Pariser Hof that he was coming, and both the young ladies had made
most careful toilettes, and perhaps sorely tried the temper of their
attendants--Herminia, to please her watchful and somewhat suspicious
aunt; Ernestine to please herself, and perhaps with a secret desire
to please her brother's boasted friend, who, being an Englishman,
would, she feared, be rather critical and fastidious.

And still further to achieve the laudable end of subduing him, she
was now at her piano, practising sundry vapid fashionable songs which
she had learned in England, just as our English girls strum German
and Italian, learned, perhaps, at second hand from some poor needy
governess.  Most warmly had Heinrich written to her again and again
about his English comrade, who had once actually fought a duel for
him at Altona, when he was too ill to fight for himself, so Ernestine
was all anxiety to know, receive, and thank him; for she doted on
Heinrich, her only brother, as a loving, tender, and devoted sister
alone can dote.

During all the past week, Herminia had but one thought, especially
when riding, driving, or walking abroad.  Her lover had confidently
promised to see her again, and to follow her to Frankenburg; but she
had seen nothing of him, and no letter or note, however brief, had
reached her.

Why was this?  She could find no answer in her heart, and doubt and
anxiety cost her many tears in secret.

There had been great bustle and anticipation all day long in the
somewhat secluded mansion in consequence of the expected arrival of
the young Herr Graf and his friend.  The family were to be 'not at
home' to any visitors.  Already Grunthal, Rheinburg, and sundry other
Grafs had called in their ramshackle old-fashioned coaches and
droschkies, covered with coats-of-arms exhibiting the usual German
infinity of quarterings; and certain officials of Aix-la-Chapelle,
with their wives, who, like other wives all over Germany, insisted
upon taking the titles of their husbands' occupation, had been day
after day leaving their cards, having heard that 'the Belles of
Frankenburg had returned;' but now all were to be denied, and this
afternoon was to be devoted to the only son of the house.

The Countess, who, though a modern lady of fashion, requiring her
novels, cushions, Spitz lap-dog in a basket, and the _Kladderadatch_
to get through the day, was nevertheless, on the other hand, as
thrifty a German housewife as any of the old school, had bustled
about overseeing the culinary preparations, while her husband, Count
Ulrich, who was passionately addicted to the pleasures of the chase,
spent only half that day in the woods, and was now, with a huge pipe
(having a china bowl and tassel) in his mouth, watching, like a
sentinel, from a terrace before the drawing-room windows, the road
that wound away towards Aix-la-Chapelle.

The once smart officer of Uhlans, who had ridden on old Blucher's
staff at Waterloo, on that eventful day when the 'Iron Duke' wept
with joy to hear the boom of the Prussian cannon--the smart Lancer,
of whom the Countess had boasted at the Grand Hotel, was somewhat
obese now.  He was, in fact, a very stout, bald-headed, and rather
coarsely featured old Teuton, with a red ribbon (of course) at his
button-hole, and a thick plain hoop on his marital finger, as all
married men wear one in Germany.

He had been kept uninformed, so far as Herminia knew, of her aversion
to his son, and her very decided preference for a certain obscure
Herr Mansfeld, whose image was rising painfully before her, as she,
too, from time to time, looked down on the distant view, to where the
spires of the Dom Kirche of Aix rose darkly up amid the ruddy haze of
evening.

The Countess could detect in the face and deportment of her niece
that which the preoccupied or uninformed Count did not.  It was but
too evident that Herminia had passed a disturbed night, a restless
and feverish day.  Indeed, Ernestine admitted that she had heard her
sighing and moaning in her sleep, and Herminia had quitted her couch
that morning resolving to appeal to the chivalry, the manhood, the
charity, and honour of her cousin to release her from the yoke, the
thraldom his family had placed upon her, even with the loss of her
fortune.

Ignorant of this resolution, the Countess took her niece's passive
hand--and a lovely little hand it was--in hers, and said kindly but
firmly--

'Meine liebe, I trust that when our dear Heinrich arrives, you will
not exhibit any unpleasant coldness towards him.'

'Can you expect me to exhibit warmth?  Is he not an utter stranger
save by name?  Would warmth in me be modest or becoming, aunt?
Besides----' she paused, for tears choked her utterance.

'Do not be alarmed, mamma,' said Ernestine, as she looked laughingly
back from her seat at the piano; 'I know our Heinrich to be so
handsome and winning, that he will soon obliterate all recollection
of our friend at the Grand Hotel.'

'Ernestine,' said Herminia reproachfully, while she glanced nervously
at the portly figure of her uncle, who was still watching the Aix
road from the lofty terrace, where the box-trees were cut into
strange and fantastic shapes, like lions and egg-cups, and where some
stately peacocks strutted to and fro.

Frankenburg is situated on the summit of a tall rock that towers
above the line of the Antwerp railway.  The actual castle is a ruined
and ivy-mantled tower of unknown, but fabulous, antiquity, as it is
actually averred to have been a hunting seat of Charlemagne.  A more
modern edifice has been engrafted on it, and this formed at the time
the residence of the Count's family.  It had all the usual comforts
of a fashionable German household; but there was still attached to it
a banqueting-hall of the seventeenth century--the pride of Count
Ulrich's heart--with its black oak roof, its rows of deer skulls and
antlers, with all the implements for fishing, shooting, and hunting,
hung upon the walls, pell-mell with fragments of armour and weapons
of every kind, from the great glaives of the middle ages to muskets
and sabres gleaned up by the Count at Ligny and Waterloo.

And there, at Christmas time, a tall fir-tree from the Reichswald;
covered with toys and cakes, grotesque masks, _papier-machÃ©_ dolls,
candles and shining lights, gladdened the hearts of the little
tenantry, who were cuddled and kissed up and down by the hearty old
Baron acting Father Christmas, with a mighty white beard, a cowl, and
long wand; while Ernestine and Herminia glided about like good
fairies, dispensing viands and wine to the sturdy Teutons and their
blooming fraus, when the trees of the Reichswald were leafless and
bare, and the branches glittered like silver and crystal in the
frostwork, and the first snowdrops of the season were peeping up in
sheltered spots, and the brown stacks of the last harvest were
mantled with snow.

And on these annual festive occasions there was seen the Countess
Adelaide, as lively and jovial at fifty, if not so pretty, as she was
at fifteen.  There, too, were the grim ancestry, the men and women of
other days and years, looking down from their garlanded frames, in
ruffs and stomachers, in breastplates or fardingales, just as Hans
Holbein, Rubens, and others had depicted them, and looking as demure
as if they had never flirted, squeezed hands under the tablecloth,
known the use of the mistletoe, or been like other folks 'world
without end.'

'Hoch! hoch!  Gott in Himmel! here they come--here is our dear boy at
last!' exclaimed the Count, clapping his fat pudgy hands, as the open
britzka, drawn by a pair of sparkling bays, came suddenly in sight,
with two officers in blue uniforms occupying the back seat.  One of
these--Heinrich, no doubt--was waving his forage-cap, and the vehicle
was driven straight to the grand approach.  The enthusiasm of the old
veteran of Waterloo swelling up in his breast when he saw the uniform
of the 95th, for

  'He thought of the days that had long since gone by,
    When his spirit was bold and his courage was high.'


Herminia grew deadly pale, and took advantage of the Countess
hurrying out upon the terrace to retire to her own room, whither,
however, her watchful aunt almost immediately followed her.

'Dearest Aunt Adelaide, oh! spare me this great mortification!'
intreated the trembling girl.

'Spare you?' repeated her aunt, now seriously angry, in expectation
of a public scene before Charlie Pierrepont, a stranger.

'Yes, I implore you to spare me the horror of this meeting.  Oh,
Ludwig!' she moaned in her heart, 'my own Ludwig!'

'I do not know whether you are most weak or defiant,' replied her
aunt.  'I give you a quarter of an hour to recover your composure and
to make your appearance properly in the drawing-room, with such a
bearing as will not be an insult to my son, to the memory of your
father, and our whole family.'

And with these words the Countess swept haughtily away.

Herminia bathed her face and hands with eau-de-cologne and water,
gave a finishing touch to her hair, kissed the envelope which
contained the now dry and faded leaves of Ludwig's rose, placed it in
her soft white bosom as a charm to strengthen her for the purpose she
had in hand, and descended noiselessly to the drawing-room, when the
sound of several voices, laughing loudly, jarred sorely on her ears
and excited nerves.

She entered with her heavy eyelids drooping, and advanced with her
gaze bent on the oak planks of the polished floor; then she shuddered
as some one approached and took her unresisting hand.

'Herminia, dearest, look up! look upon _me_!' said a familiar voice.

'Ludwig! my own Ludwig!' she exclaimed in astonishment--almost
terror, to see him there, and in the uniform of the Thuringians, as
he said--

'And now, cousin, let me introduce you to my dear friend, Herr Carl
Pierrepont of ours.'

'Ludwig?' said the thoroughly bewildered girl.

'No Ludwig at all,' he replied, laughing, and embracing her; 'but
your own cousin, my belle--Heinrich of Frankenburg.'

'Aunt Adelaide!--Ernestine!--what _does_ all this mean?'

'It means, my dear child,' said the Countess, laughing heartily at
her niece's perplexity; 'it means that it was all a plot of
Ernestine's and Heinrich's, too.  They had early learned your
repugnance to the plan of betrothal, when you were too young to
consent or refuse, and we all saw the folly of a constraint that
seemed so heart-sickening to you.  Thus we arranged that you should
meet him as a stranger under an assumed name.  You have met, and know
and love each other, so the tie of that love alone binds you now.'

'Oh, Ernestine, my sweet cousin, forgive and forget my reproaches!'
exclaimed the blushing and trembling, but happy girl, as she laid her
head on the bosom of the beautiful brunette, who laughed and kissed
her, fondling her as if she were a child.

'Well, Carl,' said Heinrich, 'what do _you_ think of all this?'

'That I wish you every joy; but I must own, that when proposing to
"have out" this Herr Mansfeld, your reply about shooting at
_yourself_ in a mirror puzzled me,' said Pierrepont, laughing
heartily at the whole situation, and enchanted with the happy scene
amid which he was introduced to two such beautiful girls as the
famous Belles of Frankenburg.

But now the bell clanged for dinner.  The Countess took his arm, the
Count leading with his niece, Heinrich and his sister following, all
laughter and smiles.

The only silent one there was the radiant Herminia, who had been, as
her affianced said, 'so pleasantly tricked.'




CHAPTER IV.

CHARLIE IN LOVE.

That night, at the very time the three gentlemen were in the
smoking-room busy with their china-bowled pipes, and with silver
tankards of beer before them--Heinrich full of happy dreams about his
fair-haired cousin and the trick they had played her; the old Count
full of memories of Waterloo and the coming war, French insolence,
the Vaterland, and all the rest of it; Charlie thinking how divinely
Ernestine sang and played, how sweet her downcast lashes looked, how
bright her upward glances, how lovely were the white hands that
wandered over the ivory keys, and made the said keys look very dark
and yellow by comparison, and while to him and Heinrich it seemed
that life at Frankenburg would be almost insupportable without the
two 'belles' thereof.  While all this was being thought of in the
smoking-room, we say, the two young ladies were comparing their notes
in their mutual dressing-room before retiring for the night to their
beds--those most uncomfortable couches which, in 'the Vaterland,' are
mere wooden boxes with pillows half-way down, and so arranged that
one can neither sit nor lie at full length therein.

That Charlie was handsome, agreeable, pleasant, and so forth, was
voted and carried _nem. con._, and Ernestine was full of fun and
pleasure at the success of her scheme--for with her it
originated--for luring Herminia into love with her brother by having
him introduced to her as a stranger.

'But oh, Herminia!' she exclaimed, 'to think of you getting the start
of me!'

'In what way?' asked Herminia, putting the whitest of feet into the
daintiest of slippers.

'In getting engaged _first_; it is most unkind!' continued Ernestine,
laughing, as she let down the masses of her dark silky hair.

'You forget, dear cousin, that I was engaged when in my cradle or
berceaunette.'

Then the two girls, now nearly half-undressed, laughed as only young
and happy girls can laugh, and with two snowy arms upheld, and
dimpled elbows shown, Ernestine went on brushing out that thick, dark
silky hair of hers.

'I declare, Herminia, I _do_ think I am pretty,' said she, suddenly
pausing and surveying herself in her laced night-robe in the long
cheval glass.

'You are too beautiful not to be quite aware of it,' replied Herminia.

'I wonder if Carl Pierrepont admired me?'

'Why?'

'Because--I should like him to do so.'

'Who could fail to admire you?' responded the happy Herminia.

'How sweetly he sang that song with me.'

'Heinrich tells me he is poor,' was the suggestive remark of Herminia.

'Alas!' after a pause, the former said, smiling.

'Herr Pierrepont scarcely took his gaze off you all the night; when
you sang alone he seemed entranced, and when with you, in those
duets, his voice became tender and tremulous.'

'Herminia, do you really think so, or do you jest?'

'I do not jest; hence my suggestion about his being poor, for that
man is loving you at first sight.'

'Your own sudden happiness, and the revulsion of feeling consequent
to the great _dÃ©nouement_ of to-day, lead you to think so,' replied
Ernestine, her smile brightening nevertheless, for she liked the idea.

'Nay, nay, his visit is to last some time; and time will prove that I
am right,' persisted Herminia, twisting up her coils of golden brown
hair.

Ernestine sat for a time toying with a velvet slipper half on and
half off her pretty foot, and then suddenly she said--

'Oh, Herminia, how can such a man care for me?'

'Why not, cousin dear? who would not, or could not, fail to care for
you?'

'But he seems so proud and cold, and so very English.'

'You quite mistake, and only wish to hear me contradict you.  He is
much less so than your special admirer, Baron GrÃ¼nthal, the Director
of the Upper Consistorial Court.'

'A hideous old frump!' said Ernestine, tossing her head.

'Old!  He is only forty.'

'But that is more than twice my age.  My husband must be young and
handsome.'

'Like Carl Pierrepont?'

'Yes, like Carl Pierrepont.'

'He certainly seems to have impressed you,' said Herminia.

'You forget how often and how much Heinrich has written of him in his
letters to me.  He seems quite like an old friend.  How strange it
would be,' continued the girl, while a dreamy expression stole into
her beautiful dark eyes, as she sat with her slender fingers
interlaced over her knees, 'how very strange it would, if in him I
should have met--met----'

'What, cousin?

'My fate.'

'Let him take heed, that, in meeting you, he has not met with his
own,' said Herminia merrily.

'I have been longing to go to a wedding, and yours more than all,
dear Herminia; for being aware of your betrothal, it was one to which
I always looked forward.  I shall be one of the bridesmaids, of
course; and the two daughters of the Justiz-rath, and the two girls
from Rheinberg, though their toilettes are odious, and Hermangilda's
hair is always muffled up like a mop.'

'A golden mop, though; but, dearest cousin, how your tongue does run
on!  Does it never occur to you that no marriage can take place with
this French war--oh, meine Gott!--before us?'

And her eyes of violet blue suddenly filled with tears as she spoke,
as vague images of death and battle rose before her.

'Forgive me, Herminia.  Yet I was not jesting.'

'Forgive you, dear?  Yes.  I may as well do so,' replied the other
girl, kissing her cousin on both cheeks; 'for to you and aunt I owe
the love that Heinrich bears me--the love that I bear him.'

'And which Herr Mansfeld so nearly carried off!'

'And now, as we have our prayer's to say, good-night.'


Herminia was right; the girl, indeed, a close observer, was seldom
wrong in her deductions, for 'Herr Carl Pierrepont' was hopelessly
smitten at last by Ernestine, who, like the lively blonde, her
cousin, was rich in those charms, and mere than all, those pretty
mannerisms, or tricks of women, that win and secure a man's love for
ever.

Charlie was neither proud nor reserved--only a little shy at first;
he had been engaged in many _affaires du coeur_, but a genuine attack
of the tender passion was new to him.  He soon found himself
regularly installed and adopted, an _ami du maison_, with this
delightful family at Frankenburg.  As an Englishman, his natural love
of hunting, shooting, and fishing won him the friendship of the old
Count, with whom he drank as many flasks of Rhine wine and jugs of
beer as he wished; but he had one blot in the eyes of the latter--he
could never take cordially to _saur kraut_.

He was a prime favourite with the Countess from his general
_bonhommie_ of manner; and with Ernestine--ah! well, with
Ernestine--he speedily became more of a favourite than the girl would
have dared to acknowledge even to herself.

Society at Frankenburg was narrow and monotonous; most of the
visitors who came, especially Baron GrÃ¼nthal and the Justiz-rath,
spoke only of politics, of Bismarck's plans, and the coming war,
which did not interest the ladies, save in so far as the 95th
Thuringians were concerned.

The days were devoted to rides and rambles amid the beautiful scenery
around the old Schloss; the evenings to music, to singing, and
frequently to dancing when the daughters of the Justiz-rath, or those
of Baron Rhineberg, were present; and then our two 95th men were
always in full uniform, _Ã  la Prussien_; and the ladies were all
unanimous that Charlie looked _so_ handsome.

Those epaulettes! those epaulettes!  To many a young English officer
the pride and glory of wearing them was only secondary to the kiss of
the first girl he loved; and where are they _now_?

So Charlie was proud of his epaulettes.

Heinrich had fairly won his lovely cousin--under 'false colours,'
certainly; but, nevertheless, he _had_ won her; perhaps, from the
girl's peculiar temperament and pride, he might never have done so
otherwise; but having so won her, he was compelled to be thankful,
for with this odious French war on the _tapis_--a war which, but for
his love, he would have hailed with genuine German ardour, and the
95th under 'orders of readiness' for the Rhine--marriage, as Herminia
herself had said, was not to be thought of: so they had but to trust
to time and wait.

The Countess being always busy about the management of her household,
the Count having frequently to visit Aix about a lawsuit in one of
the courts there, and Heinrich being usually much with his _fiancÃ©e_,
threw Charlie and the young Grafine so much together that their
hearts were hopelessly entangled; yet no word of love escaped the
latter: he knew too well his lack of civil rank, and how many, or
rather how _few_, kreutzers he had per diem as a Prussian lieutenant
of infantry.  He could but abandon himself to the witchery of her
society, to dream of the joy of loving and being loved by her, and
drift away on the tide, too well aware that the charm of such a life
and the tender influences of such society could not last for ever.

With all their exalted and somewhat absurd ideas of their own family,
their rank and antiquity, the household of the Count and Countess Von
Frankenburg was a homely and kindly one; and, after his garrison
life, there was, to Charlie, a wonderful charm in accompanying the
cousins, Ernestine especially, to see the plough and carriage horses
taken to water at a certain pond below the old Schloss, to feed the
peacocks on the terrace, to throw corn to the hens, and watch them
picking and pecking between the stones in the yard at the home farm.

And Ernestine was to him the Eve of this Eden!

But for the soft and gentle influences under which Charlie and his
friend were at Frankenburg, they would certainly, like Prussian
officers in general (though gaming is strictly forbidden in the
army), have spent many an hour at the New Redoute, or Gaming House,
in the Comphausbad-Strasse, where games of hazard, rouge-et-noir,
roulette, and so forth, are played from morning till midnight.

In lieu of this dissipation, they had quiet walks in the woods or
visits to old ruins in the neighbourhood; and Ernestine, who was
German enough to have a strong love of the mystic, the ethereal, and
the romantic, and a desire to dabble with the unseen world, told
Charlie many a strange weird story; and though with all an
Englishman's mistrust of such things, it was impossible not to be
charmed by her earnestness, the modulation of her voice, the bright
expression of the dilated hazel eye, and the occasional but perfectly
innocent pressure of her pretty hand upon his arm, when she sought to
impress him by some remarkable episode.

In the old ivied tower at Frankenburg she showed him the window of
the room in which the third wife of Charlemagne, Fastrada, daughter
of Count Raoul, died, while the Emperor was absent at Frankfort; and
told how he caused her body, which was so fair and beautiful, to the
end that it might never decay, to be enclosed in a coffin of the
purest crystal, which he kept in that chamber, and he never quitted
it by day or by night, neglecting his empire and government, and
forgetting all the concerns of war or peace, till Turpin the Wise
resolved to cure him.

Watching his opportunity, while the Emperor slept, he opened the
coffin, and took the golden wedding-ring from the finger of Fastrada,
and cast it into the lake below the castle, and thus broke Charles'
spell of sorrow.  From that day the great lake into which the magic
ring was cast, and which quite surrounded the Schloss, began to
shrink, and nothing of it remained but the tiny horse-pond already
mentioned.

And while she was telling this legend, a little grey owl sat in the
window of the ruin, winking and blinking in the sunshine, as if he
was weary of having heard the story so often.

The ruin, too, was haunted by the spectre of a former Count of
Frankenburg, who, resolving to get rid of his Countess, to the end
that he might marry again, invited her to share a dish of love-apples
with him.  These he divided with a silver-knife poisoned on one side;
but by some mistake, he ate all the poisoned halves himself, and so
fell dead at the table; and there in the upper story of the tower,
his cries of pain and despair were sometimes heard on the wind in the
stormy nights of winter.

So, amid this sweet intercourse--like one gathering beautiful flowers
on the brink of a giddy precipice--did Charlie Pierrepont drift into
a deep and hopeless passion.

He never spoke of it, but surely his eyes must have told, and his
manner too, that he loved her.  Oh yes, how he loved her, this
earnest and warm-hearted young Englishman, yet was silent.  He dared
not seek to lead her into a promise to wait till the sun of Fortune
shone on him, to waste her young and happy life till slow promotion
came: and even were he a colonel, the Count might--nay, would--look
for wealth or rank, or both; and while he--Charlie--was thus waiting,
could he ask a girl so lovely to trust to the doctrine of chances,
for a lucky spoke in the wheel of the blind goddess, and to grow
_fade_ and withered with the sickness of hope deferred?

Yet the sweet face, the dark shining hair, the tender, bright eyes,
the pretty winning ways--oh, those pretty winning ways, that twine so
round the heart of a man!--haunted him in the waking hours of the
night, and in his tormenting, yet delicious, dreams by day.




CHAPTER V.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DOM KIRCHE.

Strong though the sentiment of friendship that existed between him
and Heinrich, Charlie shrunk from making a confidant of him, as he
knew but too well that his aristocratic prejudices and native
ambition would preclude him from having any sympathy with such a
secret love, or giving it the least encouragement.

So the days of joy stole away at Frankenburg, till Charlie began to
reckon sadly the few that yet remained, when time would inexorably
separate him from Ernestine, and, too probably, for ever.

Did she suspect that he loved her?

A hundred times had Charlie asked this question of himself in doubt:
he was not an egotist; but every glance of her soft hazel eyes--that
seemed, he knew not why, something between a caress and a compliment,
together with a dash of entreaty--might have told him that he was
far, far indeed from being indifferent to her.

In the spirit of the old song, he often thought,

  'He either fears his fate too much,
    Or his desert is small,
  Who dare not put it to the touch
    To win or lose it all.'


If 'things did not turn,' in time--and for him how could they turn?
it was torment to think of losing her by his own silence and
diffidence; of seeing her, perhaps, won by another, far his inferior
in bearing and spirit, while he hungered for her smile, doted on her
shadow, and alternately blessed and _banned_ the hour that brought
him to the Castle of Frankenburg.

He thanked Heaven that there was this impending war with France
before them.  On the banks of the Rhine, or before the walls of
Paris, if he ever reached it, a French bullet might end it all for
him, and he would never have the horror and sorrow of knowing that
she was the bride of another; and so on, and on, day by day, when by
her side, talking with her and enjoying all the sweet charms of her
society, did this honest fellow torment himself, for we may, in the
matters of love and jealousy, torment ourselves far more than others
can.

Of this, a terror of every possible _parti_ who approached her was
one element, especially if rich or titled.

There was Baron GrÃ¼nthal, who came about Ernestine more than Charlie
relished.  He was a man of great influence, and Oberconsistorial
Director of the Court at Aix, not over forty, and rather
good-looking.  Even the daughter of a Count might be pleased to
become Baroness GrÃ¼nthal.

Then one or two young Counts, friends of Heinrich, were among the
frequent visitors, and Charlie gnawed his moustache viciously, as he
pictured to himself, perhaps meeting her years hence, as the wife of
one of these, when he was getting grey, weary of waiting for the
promotion that never came; or if it did, he would value so little
then: for with her, the glory of life would depart.

Getting grey?  But she would be a matron then in years; and does not
Jean Jacques Rousseau tell us that a pair of grey-haired lovers were
never known to sigh for each other?  But Charlie thrust that thought
aside; he preferred to live in the pleasant present than to picture
the gloomy future.  No romantic incident, no runaway horse, no death
averted from accident, or other melodramatic episode to draw largely
on the young lady's gratitude, as in novels, led to Charlie's avowal
of his love.

It all came about suddenly, in the most unromantic way, a quick
outpouring of passion, a rush, as it were, of the heart to the lips,
through the influence of which he told her that he loved her, her
only, and craved her love in return; and it all came to pass in this
fashion.

One day--Charlie Pierrepont never forgot it--they had contrived to
get away alone, to visit the great Dom Kirche at Aix, the shady
aisles and vast depths of which, with all its sequestered chapels,
were as well calculated to lure them into sweet and earnest converse
as the leafy alleys of a forest.

They had visited the tomb of Charlemagne, where, as Ernestine, while
leaning on Charlie's arm, and looking up in his face, from under one
of the prettiest of hats, told him with bated breath, that when it
was opened in the tenth century, the Emperor was not found in the
usual fashion of the dead, reclining in his coffin, but seated on a
throne as if alive, clothed in imperial robes, a sceptre in his hand,
and the gospels on his knee.  On his fleshless brow was a crown, and
by his side his famous sword, Joyeuse.

'And now,' added his charming guide, 'I shall show you the throne on
which he was seated; it stands in the Hoch Munster.'

Now the said Hoch Munster is a gallery running round the octagon,
facing the choir, and to reach it a narrow stair had to be traversed.
Charlie, who, strange to say, had drawn off his gloves, held out a
hand to guide Ernestine, who, by another coincidence, had drawn off
one of hers, and when Charlie's fingers closed on her soft and
velvet-like little hand, the desire to press it naturally occurred to
him, but a thrill, as if of electricity, went to his heart, when he
felt--with the gentlest assurance in the world--the pressure returned!

The stair to the Hoch Munster was surely steeper than usual, they
ascended it so slowly.  Amid its obscurity, Charlie pressed to his
lips twice the accorded hand, which was not withdrawn, and ere they
gained the upper step that led to the gallery, the great secret of
Charlie's heart had escaped him, and flushed and palpitating;
Ernestine heard him with downcast eyes.

The vehemence with which the avowal was made, though his voice was
low and earnest, and the tender expression with which he regarded
her, when they did emerge into daylight, bewildered her a little,
which, perhaps, was the reason that she permitted Charlie to take
prisoner her other hand; but after a time she regained her composure,
and, looking up at him with a most bewitching expression in her
tender brown eyes and pouting lip, said, as if she had doubted her
ears, in a whispered voice,

'You--you love me?'

'Yes--oh yes!  Dearest Ernestine, you must have known from the
first--from the very first hour I saw you, that I loved you.'

'I always thought,' she continued, in the same low and certainly
agitated voice, 'that you preferred my society to that of Herminia or
the Rhineberg girls.'

'Preferred your society--oh, Ernestine!'

'I did think that you were very fond of me--yes, very fond of me; but
that you actually loved me, I could not conceive.'

So the lovely little gipsy pretended, and cast her eyelids down,
while her soft bosom heaved so much with emotion that her diamond
brooch sparkled like prisms.  After a pause, the tender eyes were
again uplifted to Charlie, and as if she rather liked the sound of
the avowal, she said timidly,

'And so you love me--love me, Carl?'

How Charlie's heart now leaped to hear his Christian name uttered by
her lips for the first time!

'Ernestine, my own darling!' (et cetera, and so forth).

They remained--as the sacristan who was patiently waiting for his
fees said--quite long enough to have made an acute archaeological
investigation of the whole place; but somehow their minds were
otherwise occupied.

Singularly enough, they had forgotten all about the throne of
Charlemagne, and actually descended--slower than they had
ascended--the stairs of the Hoch Munster without having seen it.

They were both very silent on the drive homeward, but their young
hearts were brimming over with joy, and deep blushes suffused the
face of Ernestine, and her lips were trembling; and as if her
mother's eye might read how they had been occupied in the Dom Kirche,
she hurried upstairs to her own room, to seek in solitude the power
of reflecting over all that had passed, and her new position, for
within an hour she had passed a certain rubicon in life.

Charlie, too, desired to be alone, and ascended into the recess of
the ruined Schloss, where, among the owls and the ivy, he slowly
lighted a cigar, and while his heart was full of love and happiness,
and of gratitude to Ernestine for returning his passion, he began to
consider what was to be done next.

He first abandoned himself to a dream of joy.  In imagination
Ernestine was with him still; her hands so soft and small yet
lingered in his; her lips were still before him, and the perfume of
her dark hair came back to him, as he rehearsed, over and over again,
all that episode in the Dom Kirche.

The secret that had trembled so long on his tongue--the secret that
cold prudence and dread of German pride withheld so long, had escaped
him at last.  His love had been avowed; that love was accepted and
reciprocated.

But now, alas! there came home to Charlie's heart those thoughts that
had occurred to him before--thoughts that had not, as yet, entered
the mind of Ernestine.  The future--how and what was it to be?  How
cold and miserable was reflection--miserable, but for a time only.
Was not the fact of mutual love and perfect trust existing between
them enough to make all seem glorious, and the path of life most
flowery?

She loved him--that bright and beautiful girl!  Beyond that love she
might never be his; but with that love for him, she would never be
the wife of another.  Yet, as he before asked himself, was it just or
generous that her young life should be wasted, and for him?

If he suggested an elopement, in what light would such an episode
place him with his friend Heinrich, with her whole family, with his
regiment, and society, even, which was very, very doubtful, if she
would accede to such a measure.

So long as he had not spoken of love to Ernestine, but lingered on
the pleasant borderland that adjoins the realms of Cupid, Charlie
felt that he was guilty of no breach of faith with her family, and no
violation of the hearty hospitality extended to him.  But _now_ his
position seemed entirely altered.  Their love was a fact; he had won
her heart without the consent of her parents, and that consent, in
his subaltern rank in social and military life, he knew but too well
would never be accorded to him.

'Well, well,' thought he, with something of grim joy, 'the war is
before me, and who can foresee what honours I may win in defending
Germany, or on the soil of France!'

When the party in the Schloss met at dinner that evening, there was a
conscious expression in the faces of Charlie and Ernestine that they
alone could read, and to which their hearts had alone the key; and to
both there was something novel, joyous, and inexpressibly sweet in
this secret understanding between them.  Each felt a delicious
interest and right of proprietary in the other.

Among the visitors was Baron GrÃ¼nthal, the Oberdirector of the
Consistory Court at Aix, a stout and florid, but rather handsome man,
in the prime of life, with an ill-trimmed moustache hiding his whole
mouth, and the inevitable red ribbon at his button-hole, who
mentioned incidentally that he had seen the Grafine and Herr
Pierrepont leaving the Dom Kirche by the great door, on either side
of which are a she-wolf and a fir apple in bronze.  Ernestine stooped
over her bouquet to hide her conscious blush.

'You know, mamma,' said she, in a tone of explanation, though none
was required, 'we drove into town, Herr Pierrepont and I, that I
might show him the tomb and throne of Charlemagne.'

'Ah! yes,' said the Baron, making his champagne effervesce with a
piece of biscuit; 'did you think the marble slabs of a good colour,
Herr Pierrepont?'

'Beautiful!' said Charlie.  'The finest black I ever saw,' he
desperately added, at a venture.

'Black?' said two or three voices.  'Why, they are of the purest
_white_!'

'Exactly; that was what I meant to say.  My German is not perfect,
Herr Baron,' said Charlie.

And Ernestine, who had grown pale, now laughed and glanced furtively
at her lover.

Dinner over, the Count and Baron retired to smoke and talk politics;
but the latter, whose suspicions had been roused by the confused
manner of Charlie, and the evident absorption of him and his fair
companion when quitting the Dom Kirche, began to talk of something
that might seriously affect their happiness.

Charlie and Ernestine betook themselves to the piano, where eye could
look into eye, and finger touch finger occasionally in the duet, or
soft whispers be exchanged amid a sonata of Beethoven; the Countess
retired to doze in the boudoir, with her Spitz pug on her knee; while
Herminia and her betrothed found sufficient attraction in each other;
so the evening of this eventful day passed off peacefully and
happily, as many others had done.

During the protracted progress of the sonata, the two antiquarians
from the Dom Kirche agreed that their engagement--for such they fully
considered it now--should, as yet, not be divulged to anyone, not
even to Herminia, from whom Ernestine had never before had a secret
to withhold.

Outwardly, our hero and heroine seemed merely intimate friends who
were soon to part; inwardly, they had their own happy thoughts, while
the family had not the slightest suspicion of how matters stood,
though that night all was on the very verge of discovery!

In the recess of a window, whither they had gone to study the stars,
Charlie suddenly pressed Ernestine to his breast.

'Oh, dearest, don't do that again!' she exclaimed.  'Aunt Adelaide
may see us; and she has the eyes of a lynx!'

After this night, matters progressed fast with the lovers.  In the
same house, they had a hundred means of meeting each other, were it
but for five minutes at a time.  Rings and locks of hair, of course,
with coloured photos--the best that could be got in
Aix-la-Chapelle--had been exchanged; promises were made and vows
exchanged again and again, with other delicious tokens equally
intangible.

In the flush of his love, Charlie forgot for a time the cruel doubts
that had at first oppressed him.  Ernestine should be his wife at all
risks, even if he carried her off to England; and, in the ardour of
his imagination, he began to marvel whether his father's old place in
Warwickshire would ever be free from those debts which drove him to
become a wanderer, a soldier of fortune, and to feed himself by his
sword in the ranks of the Prussian army.




CHAPTER VI.

AN ALARM.

Amid the pure satisfaction arising from the knowledge that Ernestine
loved him, and the natural anxiety to discover how she was ever to be
his wife, there was fated to come to Charlie Pierrepont the fear of
greater opposition to his--as yet--secret hopes and wishes, in the
person of a formidable rival, who, in a few weeks after the visit to
the Dom Kirche, came suddenly into the field.

One evening, when the Count, his son, and Charlie were seated cosily
in a place which the former called his study (but which more
resembled a harness and gun room, and littered with pipes of all
kinds, as the literature there consisted of a few volumes on hunting,
shooting, farriery), with their pipes and flasks of Rhine wine, which
they drank from silver tankards, the Count startled our hero by a
revelation which he made to him as a friend of the family.

A wealthy and great man--an intimate friend of the house of
Frankenburg, who, though not noble, was nevertheless Hochwohlgeboren,
had made proposals for the hand of Ernestine.

The cloud of smoke in which the trio had enveloped themselves perhaps
prevented the father and son from seeing the sudden contraction of
Charlie's brow on getting this unpleasant information.

'Does it meet with your approval, Count?' he asked, with a violent
effort to appear calm.

'In every respect.'

'And yours, Heinrich?'

'No, Carl.'

'Why?'

'Because the man is more than double her age,' replied the young
Count.

'That is----' Charlie was about to say 'unfortunate;' but the fib
remained unuttered.  Then after a pause he asked, 'And what says the
Grafine?'

'She dismissed him with kind words, certainly,' replied the Count,
'and well-bred wishes for his happiness.  He then came to me, begging
me to use my authority over her as a parent, which I shall certainly
do.'

'Herr Graf!' exclaimed Charlie, who felt a keener interest in all
this than his hearers imagined; for even Heinrich, in the absorption
of his passion for his cousin, had not the faintest suspicion that
his friend did more than admire his sister; 'Herr Graf, would you
actually attempt to control your daughter's affections?'

'Der Teufel! attempt it?  I shall do it!' replied the Count angrily,
as he laid his hand emphatically on the arm of his chair.

So this was the first intimation Charlie had of the coming storm.  A
rival in the field, and his leave of absence on the verge of expiry!
The situation--with all his trust in Ernestine--was, to say the least
of it, alarming.  Would she actually be torn from him after all?
Fearing to speak, he remained perfectly silent; but, as his curiosity
was irrepressible, he asked after a time--

'May I ask, Herr Graf, who this suitor is?'

'The Baron GrÃ¼nthal, Oberdirector of the Consistory Court in
Aix-la-Chapelle.'

Then Charlie remembered that the Baron had been at the Schloss that
morning, and been long in the Graf's 'study' in consultation, and
that he failed to see Ernestine as usual, save at dinner, after which
she had hastily left the table.  It occurred now to Charlie, too,
that she had seemed both disturbed and taciturn during the progress
of the meal.

Such an offer was deemed flattering, even for a daughter of the house
of Frankenburg.  Ernestine had dismissed the Baron; but, backed by
her father's authority, he returned to the charge, and came the
following day to dinner; and until the bell rang for that meal,
Charlie, to his perplexity and annoyance, could see nothing of
Ernestine, who remained sequestered in her room.  Had her mother any
suspicions? thought he; but as yet the Countess had none.

On this day, in honour of the suitor, whose aspirations met with her
full approval, her white hair was done over a _toupÃ©e_ that was
higher than usual, her train was longer than ever, and she wore the
best of the family diamonds.

This was the most miserable meal ever made by Charlie Pierrepont.
The Count was rubicund, smiling, and conscious.  He had smoked many
pipes and imbibed much beer over the idea of having such a
son-in-law.  The Baron had made a careful study of his costume, and
was most gracious to the ladies, but more especially to the Countess,
who addressed nearly all her conversation to him--the winner of one
of 'the Belles of Frankenburg.'  Herminia looked waggish, Heinrich
somewhat provoked, as he deemed the suitor too old, and that his
sister's wishes should be consulted; while Ernestine--whose toilette
(a golden-coloured silk, trimmed with black lace), a most becoming
one for a brunette, had been made under the critical eye of her
mother--looked pale, 'worried,' and worn, and, like Heinrich,
provoked too, for, as we have said elsewhere, she was a self-willed
little beauty, and somewhat opinionated.

In spite of the desire of all to appear at their perfect ease, the
meal passed off awkwardly; the conversation flagged, and was unequal;
and if the eyes of Ernestine met those of Charlie, he would read in
them an imploring and sad expression, and when they looked down, they
seemed to sparkle with anger.

At last the meal passed over--and it proved the last that Charlie
Pierrepont was to consume in Frankenburg; the ladies rose from the
table to retire.

As Charlie opened the dining-room door for them, Ernestine contrived
to be the last who passed out, and swiftly and unseen, she slipped
into Charlie's hand a tiny scrap of folded paper.  This he hastened
to open and read covertly, on resuming his place at table.  It
contained but one pencilled line--

'Be in mamma's boudoir to-night at eleven, when all are in bed.'

He would have pressed it to his lips, but for the presence of those
who were with him.  Eleven o'clock?  The hour was then eight, as a
great ormolu clock on the side buffet informed him, and so he had
three long hours to wait for this most coveted interview!  And for
two of those hours he would have to endure the society--or rather the
presence--of this most obnoxious rival who had so suddenly started up
in his path, and with whom he felt a violent desire to quarrel, but
that such an episode would have been alike unseemly, unwise, and
calculated to excite suspicion.

They could meet in conversation on the neutral ground of the French
war; but in everything he stated, Charlie could not suppress a keen
desire to contradict the Baron.  The latter asserted that King
William would lead the Prussian army in person.  To this Charlie gave
a contradiction as flat as if he had it from the royal lips.  Metz
would be, undoubtedly, the chief base of the French operations.  This
idea he utterly scouted!  England would take part in the war, through
the influence of the Crown Princess.  England would do nothing of the
kind, said Charlie--what was the Rhine to her?

The Baron began to elevate his eyebrows, and became silent.  The
Count looked uneasy; one glass more, he suggested, and then they
would join the ladies.  They did so; but on entering the drawing-room
found the Countess asleep as usual, with the Spitz pug in her lap;
Herminia idling over the piano, while longing for Heinrich; and that
Ernestine was--which was never her wont--absent.

She had pleaded a headache, and retired to her own room.  The Baron
looked glum and disconcerted.  He had been framing many fine speeches
to make to his intended; but now they were no longer required.  He
should see her no more for that night.

Charlie fingered the little note in his waistcoat-pocket, and felt
defiant and jubilant.

The truth was that the Countess and her daughter had almost had high
words on the subject of the Baron.

'Mamma,' the latter had said, 'the idea of such a thing is
intolerable and absurd!'

'Why absurd, Grafine?' asked her mother, with asperity.

'A man of forty or more, getting bald already,' said Ernestine
mockingly; 'a stout man in a blue coat and brass buttons, with a red
ribbon, of course, at his lapelle; a man who, for twenty years, has
never made up his august mind to marry, comes now to make a
matrimonial victim of me.  Thanks--no.  I am the Grafine Ernestine of
Frankenburg, and such I shall remain.'

'Do you prefer anyone else?' asked the Countess, her eyes glittering
with sudden suspicion.

'No--none,' she falteringly said, with her cheeks aflame.

'Is there not _one_?'

'What do you mean, mamma?'

'I mean this,' said the Countess, with grim asperity, hiding her
suspicions, if she had any, 'my dear child, the regiment of Heinrich
is under orders for foreign service! his leave is conditional, and
may be cancelled by telegraph at any moment; so that if we wish his
presence at the marriage, the ceremony must be performed without much
delay.'

'It shall never take place with me,' replied Ernestine resolutely.

'To your room, Grafine,' said the Countess with hauteur; so her
daughter gladly withdrew, leaving her to make excuses for her absence
as she pleased, so the usual female ailment of a headache came at
once into play.




CHAPTER VII.

AMONG THE BREAKERS.

The Baron had been driven home to Aix in his britzka, promising to
return for some final arrangements on the morrow, when he hoped to
find the health of the Grafine restored; prayers were over; the
household were all a-bed, or supposed to be so, and Charlie sat in
his own room, looking sadly out upon the distant lights of Aix, which
seemed to twinkle like the stars above them.

He had ample food for reflection.  Fear of the Baron's influence on
Ernestine he had none; but he had real fear of the influence her
family, and long-trained habits of implicit obedience, might have on
her, and genuine love and truth are commodities too scarce and
valuable in this world to be wasted.

How much, thought Charlie, were Herminia and her cousin to be envied;
they had been, and were, so successful in their love, and all through
the fortunate little scheme of the Countess and Ernestine.

How he longed to show the latter to his sisters; for Charlie had
three, in that dear old home in Warwickshire, all softly featured and
gently mannered girls, such as England excels in, more than all the
world besides.  Would they love her?  But could they fail to do so?
Well, his father might, perhaps, oh, no! he could not look coldly on
her, because she was a foreigner.  Pure innocence and beauty belong
to no country in particular; and Ernestine looked more thoroughly
English than many an English lady Charlie had seen in Regent Street
and the Row.

What was to be the end of all this?

In spite of all his prudence and the suggestions of reason, Charlie
had fallen madly in love, without considering what a costly whim a
high-born wife would prove to a Prussian subaltern; or how the prize
was to be obtained, the whim gratified.

Eleven was struck by the great old clock in the hall of the Schloss,
and Charlie, who had been awaiting it, watch in hand, took his wax
taper, and softly and swiftly descended the great staircase to the
boudoir of the Countess, a small octagonal apartment that opened off
the drawing-room.

It was, of course, without a fireplace; but, in lieu thereof, in one
corner stood the prettiest of little German stoves, a black iron
cylinder, or column, surmounted by a large coronet of ornamental
brass, and set on a block of white marble.  Numerous statuettes under
glass shades, and pretty bijou articles, littered all the marble and
marqueterie tables, with Dresden china vases of flowers, gathered
fresh that morning by Ernestine and Herminia in the garden at the
foot of the castle rock.  The furniture and hangings were all pale
blue silk, trimmed with white lace or silver; water-colours decorated
the wall, and, in a place of honour, hung a Berlin engraving
representing the meeting of Wellington and Blucher at La Belle
Alliance.

A moderator lamp, upheld by a bronze Atlas, was suddenly flashed up,
and Ernestine stood before Charlie Pierrepont.  She had let all her
hair down, probably previous to coiling it up for the night, and now
its silky masses floated over her shoulders far below her waist, and
out of their darkness, her pale, minute, and delicately cut face came
with strong distinctness in the subdued light of the lamp.  How
lovely she looked just then; her form, though _mignonne_, round and
full.  She threw her arms round Charlie, and putting her head on his
shoulder, in a way she had like a petted love-bird, placed her sweet
face amid the masses of her hair on his neck, and her lover gazed at
her for some seconds ere he seated her by his side, with a kind of
adoration, for she was in all the pride of her beauty and purity;
and, as a writer says, with truth, 'There is nothing in the universe
so exquisite, so fascinating, so irresistibly alluring, as a young
girl!  A girl in the first dawn of earliest womanhood, fresh and
fragrant as a flower, and, alas! as fragile, for that bloom of youth
is as evanescent as it is lovely, and its loss is never, to my mind,
compensated by any maturer charm.  Let who will inhale the perfume of
the opening rose, but the sweet shy mystery of the folded bud for me!'

And some such thoughts ran through the mind of Charlie as he gazed
upon her.

In the perfect confidence of this love, they did not at first speak
of this sudden suitor (who had come like a thunder-cloud into their
sunny summer sky), for rival he could scarcely be deemed by Charlie;
but they referred to the last time they had been happy together in
each other's society.  Oh, _so_ happy! and but two days ago!

They had ridden to Stolberg, after losing Heinrich and Herminia
together in the wood (rather a common occurrence, by the way, when
these four went out on excursions), and had taken shelter from a
storm of rain in a village church, where a marriage ceremony had been
performed before them, and they now recurred to this little episode.

'How sweetly pretty the bride looked!' said Charlie, playing with her
rippling hair.

'And how happy the bridegroom!' she added, pulling Charlie's
moustache, in her momentary joy, forgetful of the tears she had been
shedding.

'How I envied them, Ernestine!  Will our day ever come?'

'We can but hope.'

'And if it never comes?'

'I shall die--I shall die faithful to you, Carl.  Faithful in life
and in death!' said Ernestine, with passionate energy.

'You say this so often that you alarm me,' said Charlie, with great
tenderness of tone.

'How can my promises of faith alarm you?'

'Nay.  It is these references to death.'

Her eyes were tender, dreamy, and sad, yet full of love, as they
looked into his.  After a pause, he said,

'I, Ernestine, am more in danger of death and peril than you,
dearest.'

'Oh, say not so!  And yet, of course, it must be, Carl, my darling
Carl!' she exclaimed, throwing herself upon his breast, in a passion
of tears and affection.

'Heaven and earth!  So _these_ are the terms on which you two are!'
exclaimed a shrill, stern voice behind them, and a low wail of terror
escaped from Ernestine, on perceiving the Countess, her mother,
standing there in her _robe-de-chambre_, a wax taper in her hand, and
her usually pale cheeks and cold grey eyes inflamed with indignation.
On this night she had, unfortunately, forgotten her unlucky Spitz cur
(who was quietly looking on the scene from his basket of
mother-of-pearl) and had descended from her room in search of him.

'So! so!' she exclaimed again, 'these are the terms on which you are;
and such are the hopes in which you dare to indulge!'

How long she had been there, or how much she had heard or seen, they
knew not.  They had but one common thought--that they had been
discovered, and all was over!  This _dÃ©nouement_, occurring
immediately after the proposal of the Baron, was too much for the
patience or equanimity of the irate Countess.  Even Charlie's
friendship for her son Heinrich, and the duel he had fought in
defence of his honour, were forgotten now.

There was a pause, during which they all surveyed each other with
undisguised signs of discomposure.  At last Charlie spoke, while
Ernestine withdrew a little way from him.

'GnÃ¤dige Frau' (gracious madame), he began, 'blame not your daughter,
but me, for all this; and pardon me for having so far forgotten my
position in this house as to love her without your permission; but
could I resist doing so--even without the hope of obtaining it?  What
can I say to mitigate your probable severity to her--your resentment
to me?  What am I to do?'

'Much!'

'Oh, say it!'

'Leave my roof at once!'

'Mamma, it is close on midnight,' urged Ernestine piteously.

'Silence, minx!'

Charlie's face had flushed to the temples at a tone and command so
unusual and so humiliating.

'Oh, mamma,' urged Ernestine, attempting, but in vain, to catch her
mother's hand, 'spare me and pardon him!'

'Him?  Who!'

'Carl.'

'You call him Carl already--and this to my face!  This intruder, who,
though in the king's uniform, is little better in the scale of
society than a poor Handwerks-Burschen!'

Charlie now grew deadly pale at this insulting comparison, but
restrained his rising anger for the sake of Ernestine, who said,
piteously:

'Dearest mamma, I implore you not to adopt this tone to Heinrich's
firm and tried friend.  It is inhospitable!  It is rude!  It is
cruel!' she added, amid a torrent of tears.

'You are no judge, _now_, of what is rude or not rude--proper or
improper--to a violator of our hospitality.  Oh, Herr Pierrepont, how
little could I have foreseen all this!'

Unless the old lady had been as blind as a mole, she might, or ought,
very well to have foreseen it.

'You know my views of all this matter, and I am certain they will be
fully shared by the Count,' said the old lady, with intense hauteur.
'You also know the measures we expect you to take with as little
delay as possible.'

She made a brief and haughty half-contemptuous bow, and taking her
daughter by the hand, and, without permitting her to give even one
farewell glance, led her away.

Charlie stood for a moment as if rooted to the spot.  He then very
quietly extinguished the moderator lamp, in a mechanical kind of way,
and, taking his taper, ascended the great gaunt staircase to his
room, where, with his heart torn by the contending emotions of love
and sorrow, rage and mortification--for the insult to which he, an
English gentleman, had been subjected by that intolerant and
insufferable old German woman--he sat for a time without thinking of
undressing.

Were she not the mother of Ernestine, he would have scattered a few
pretty hard adjectives with reference to her.  He then suddenly began
to pack his portmanteau.  He had but one desire and craving--to get
as far away from Frankenburg as possible, though it was the cage that
held his love-bird!  And as if his wish had been anticipated, just as
twelve o'clock was struck by the sonorous timepiece in the echoing
hall, a knock came to his door.

'It is Heinrich,' thought he; 'come in!'

The visitor was not Heinrich, but the old family butler, who entered,
bowing low, and looking very sleepy, cross, and very much surprised.

'The Herr Graf's compliments to the Herr Lieutenant.  At what time
would he require the carriage to take him to Aix?'  (He called it
Aachen.)

'Now!'

'Now--at this hour, mein Herr?'

'Now, I repeat--instantly--thanks; you may go.'

The old butler, who had served as man and boy in the Frankenburg
family from shortly after the days of Waterloo and Ligny, who had
attended Marshal Blucher when on a visit, and had made the fortunes
and honour of the denizens of the Schloss his own, as hereditary
retainers of the Caleb Balderstone type occasionally do, even in this
age of iron, opened his grey eyes very wide, alike at the fierce
energy and the order of Charlie Pierrepont, but vanished at once to
rouse the grooms and comply.

So he was actually turned out of the house, however politely, at
last; thrust out from _her home_ as if his presence there degraded
it.  He thought of the old arms of the Pierreponts carved about his
father's gate--the lion rampant _sable_, between two wings, the
mullets _semÃ©e_, and the motto '_Pie repone te_,' though he had never
valued such things much; and his anger boiled up--nor did it cool
down till he found himself on the eve of departure.

Why did Heinrich not appear? for good or for evil?  Had he also been
informed, and, like his father, mounted a high horse?  It seemed so.
The carriage was duly announced, at last.

As Charlie descended to it, the silver-haired butler appeared again
with a salver, on which were a decanter and glass, saying:

'The Herr Graf requests that mein Herr will take a little glass of
cognac, before leaving the Schloss; the night is cold.'

To have declined to accept this last act of old German hospitality
would have been churlish, and the cause of comment among the
domestics; so Charlie, with the name of her he loved on his lips,
drained a _petit verre_, and sprang into the carriage.

'Aachen,' said the butler to the driver, as he closed the door, and
bowing, said--

'Gute nacht--leben sie wohl, mein Herr.'

And Charlie, as he thought, turned his back on Frankenburg for ever.

Ernestine was as much, if not more, than any _only_ daughter could be
to Count Ulrich.  He was selfish enough to have looked with stern,
black, and utter discouragement on any swain who had no high rank;
then how much more with anger on a penniless soldier of Fortune--a
sub. of the Thuringians, like Charlie Pierrepont.

'All is at an end between the Frankenburgs and me,' thought the
latter, as the carriage bowled on in the dark; 'but the war once
over, if I escape it, I shall carry her off at all hazards--by
Heaven, I shall.'

As a soldier accustomed to change of quarters, billets, camps, and
barracks, Charlie could make himself at home anywhere; but nowhere
(save his father's house) had he found himself so much at home as in
that old German castle: a shrine he deemed it--a shrine of which
Ernestine was the idol; and now he was exiled from it.




CHAPTER VIII.

CHARLIE'S VISITOR.

The carriage deposited Charlie Pierrepont at an hotel in
Aix-la-Chapelle, where he meant to remain for a little to make some
attempt to see Ernestine once more--to arrange, if possible, about
their future correspondence, and then to rejoin the Thuringians.

The dawn stole in over the city, and the Rhine began to glitter in
light--the dawn of that day on which the Baron GrÃ¼nthal was to return
to Frankenburg, and 'the final arrangements' were to be made.  What
would they be?

Five o'clock tolled from the great bell of the Dom Kirche.  But five
hours since she had been in his arms, with her head resting on his
breast; how long it seemed ago; what storm of alarm, bitterness, and
mortification had agitated his heart since then!  The bell of the Dom
Kirche brought instantly back to memory that day in the stair of the
Hoch Munster, when the returned pressure of her little hand, though
ever so lightly, nearly put him beside himself with joy, and lured
him to divulge the great secret of his heart.

So all their stolen glances and sweet daily intercourse were at an
end now; all the quaint weird stories that she had been wont to tell
him in their rides and rambles, of sprites and elves, of lurlies and
knights, who had loved and been drawn thus into peril, all their
mutual songs and music, would never come again!

Too probably their paths on earth might lie for ever apart.  A chasm
separated the past from the present; still more did it seem to yawn
between the present and the future; so Charlie could but wring his
hands, and wish, at times, that Heinrich had never brought him to
Frankenburg.

Ah, those lovely eyes that were ever varying in expression, now
dreamy and tender, and anon bright with mischief, or soft with
inexpressible love; the pouting rosebud lips, that were so firm and
delicately cut; the skin, smooth as satin; the hands, of velvet: the
pinky tint on the rounded cheek; the winning ways and the quaint
sayings of Ernestine--were they all, indeed, to be as things of the
past to him?  It was intolerable!

They would be all as air-drawn pictures--nothing more.  To
Pierrepont, it seemed as if all the brightness had gone out of his
life; or, as if half that life had left him.  Would time ever cure
this, or must it be war or death?  God alone knew!  In his sorrow for
the loss he had sustained, and for the terrible emotions which he
knew she would be feeling--torn from him on one hand, and menaced by
a hateful marriage on the other--he could almost have wept, and
perhaps would have done so, but for a glow of wrath and indignation,
at the manner in which the imperious Countess had treated him.

He had been bluntly turned out of the house!  That was what the
termination of his visit plainly amounted to.  Charlie felt that his
epaulettes had been insulted, and his native English pride revolted
at the idea.  He felt his blood boiling at times, but against whom?
It could not be against the father or the mother of her he loved so
tenderly.  Oh no! for surely they would relent in time, on seeing how
deep and tender was his passion for their daughter.

'_How_ would it all end?' he asked of himself a hundred times.

The day without was bright and sunny, but to Charlie Pierrepont it
seemed as if the hours stole dully, darkly, and drearily on.  The
guests in the Speise-saal were numerous and noisy.  Their voices
irritated him; and often he started to his feet with the intention of
vaguely proceeding to the vicinity of Frankenburg, and as frequently
relinquished the idea; for he dreaded lest he should meet the Baron,
and be tempted into the commission of some wild outrage.

With much of the same gloom that Herminia had in her mind, when, from
the windows of the Grand Hotel, on the evening our story opens, she
looked dreamily down on Cologne, on city, church, and river, did
Charlie, from a balcony of his hotel, opposite the new theatre, look
down upon the strasse that leads to Borcette, and the crowded
boulevard that now occupies the place of a levelled ditch and
rampart, and is prettily laid out with pine trees, and many tiny
sheets of water.

Dinner was set before him under the awning which shaded the balcony,
and there was a bottle of hock.  Yes; he had ordered the kellner,
mechanically, to serve it up; but the dinner remained untasted,
though the hock was drained in draughts, as if to drown the
ever-recurring thoughts--would he never again see that sweet girl
whose witcheries were entwined around his heart? should he never more
look into her eyes, whose tender glances were magnetic; never feel on
his lips those clinging kisses, while he pressed her hand to his
breast?

Near him, under an awning in front of the hotel, seated on hard
wooden stools, at a bare deal table, were some poor
Handwerks-Burschen, or travelling workmen, in blue blouses and wooden
sabots, smoking, drinking beer, and making merry with their wives or
sweethearts, and singing--

  'Draw the social chair yet closer;
    Vow by this full draught of mirth,
  That all evil is forgiven,
    Hell is banished from our earth.'

It was Schiller's beautiful 'Song of Joy' they were singing to the
clanking accompaniment of their cans and wooden shoes.  How happy
those humble fellows seemed; and how much he envied them!

But Charlie was roused from his reverie by the Oberkellner
announcing--

'Der Graf von Frankenburg.'

'Which?' asked Charlie, starting; 'Count Ulrich?'

'No, mein Herr--Count Heinrich.'

'Very good--show him up.'

Charlie would rather that the old father of Ernestine had come than
her brother, whose errand would no doubt be a hostile one.  That
Heinrich, his friend and comrade, came on such an errand seemed
horrible and unnatural.  The wild justice of the pistol, as some one
has named it, was ceasing to be appreciated even in Germany.  The
time had gone past when the pistols of skilled homicides were notched
as registers of the lives they had taken, or had cards attached to
them, with the names of the slain, the date and the place of meeting,
and the distance of fighting, all neatly written thereon.

Let Heinrich taunt him how he would, a duel must not take place.  'In
the battle-field,' thought Charlie, 'I shall cheerfully meet death,
front to front and face to face; but I shall not carry there the mark
of Cain, by perhaps shooting the brother of her I love--my brother in
the spirit.'

Charlie forgot that in the Heilinghaist-feld at Altona he had fought
a duel for that brother, and winged an officer of the King's
Grenadiers; and he was just remembering that if hostilities were
contemplated, a messenger would have been sent by Heinrich, when the
latter entered the room, and coming quickly forward to Charlie,
grasped both his hands with his usual frankness.

'Well, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance--' he was beginning, when
Charlie said--

'How can you jest, Heinrich, at a time like this?'

'I do not jest; but have come, in defiance of all family views and
prejudices, to cheer you, and have some conversation over this
wretched affair.  Poor Ernestine!  I wish you and she had taken me
into your confidence.  By our past and present friendship, I surely
merited that from you, at least.'

'A bottle of wine, Heinrich?

'Thanks--I have just galloped in from the Schloss, and had some
difficulty in finding your quarters.'

'There are cigars, and here is an easy-chair.  I am thankful you did
not come on a hostile visit.  To decline would have been disgraceful,
to accept might have been fratricide; but I should have fired in the
air.'

'What stuff you are talking!' said Heinrich, as he manipulated and
lit a cigar, while the waiter was pouring out the wine.

'Now let us talk,' said he, when the latter had withdrawn.

'And how are the ladies this evening?' asked Charlie, trying, with a
swelling heart, to talk common sense.

'As you may suppose, the Grafine, my mother, is in a furious pet; and
I knew nothing about your sudden departure till I found your place
vacant at the breakfast table.'

'And--and your sister, Heinrich?'

'Has been all day fretting in her room.'

'And the Grafine Herminia?'

'With her.  I saw Herminia for a little time to-day, and she desired
me to assure you of her fullest sympathy.'

'God bless her!' exclaimed he, whilst his eyes became moist.

'The poor little thing endured too much, when she believed me to be
Herr Mansfeld, and knew me not in my proper person, to be without due
sympathy for all afflicted lovers.'

'You do not speak of the Herr Graf.'

'Oh, he is inexorable!'

'And our infernal Baron--no doubt he was at Frankenburg to-day,
hoping to play the lover,' said Charlie viciously.

'He was not.'

'How so?'

'His Excellency has a violent fit of the gout!'

'Long may it continue!' said Charlie fervently.

'Amen!' added Heinrich, lying back in his chair and laughing
heartily; 'the idea of an adoring swain having an ailment so
unromantic!  And now for the object of my visit.  I have simply come
to apologize for all that has occurred at the Schloss; but I might
have foreseen it, had my own affairs not occupied too much of my
attention.  Ernestine is too enchanting a girl to have failed to
attract.  What is done cannot be undone.  I do love you, Carl, and
deplore all that has taken place.'

The two friends shook hands warmly.  With Charlie, his comrade,
brother officer, and most particular 'chum,' was now the link between
him and Ernestine--between him and Frankenburg--the Eden from which
he had been banished, and without his Eve.  How he loved the generous
fellow!  How gladly he would lay down his life for him; but in doing
so, he would leave Ernestine, and, perhaps, to another.  Another?
Oh! that was not to be thought of!  Heinrich began again--

'Herminia says that Ernestine has never closed an eye since last
night, which I am sorry to say, because if troubles can be slept upon
they are curable.  However, don't be alarmed about Ernestine,' he
added, laughing, 'she's very low and sad, no doubt; but there is no
chance of her drowning herself in Fastrada's pool below the
Schloss--that odious pond where I used to puddle for many a day with
a crooked pin and a string, catching many a cold, but never a fish.'

'Why, Heinrich?'

'For a very sufficient reason.  There was none in it.'

'Do you think your mother will ever forgive me?

'Heaven alone knows.  Time will show.  She has the most absurd ideas
concerning alliances and family rank.  As for my father, he storms
and gets into rages that I call apoplectic ones; but he'll sit in his
study among the saddles, dogs' collars, and so forth, and smoke
himself into quietude ere long.  He is a wonderful hale and hearty
old fellow for his great age; but he married late in life, and has
only had a silver wedding, when his comrade, old Field-Marshal
Wrangel, has had a golden one.  And, then, you are a soldier,
Carl--and to be a soldier is always a trump card with him.  You have
heard how he saved Blucher's life at Ligny?'

'Only vaguely.'

'It is a matter of history: Prussian history, at least; and was one
of those impulses, or inspirations, which, if not acted on instantly,
may never come again.  It was at Ligny where the Prussians and French
were engaged on the 16th of June, on that dreadful day of tempest;
rain, and wind, when the British were retreating from Quatre Bras to
their position at Waterloo.  Victory was evidently declaring for the
Emperor, when Blucher strove to arrest his success by consecutive
charges of cavalry.  In person he led on a regiment of Hussars, who
were repulsed; his horse fell beneath him wounded, and the great
Marshal could not be extricated, and the enemy were pressing on!  The
last of his flying Hussars had left the brave old man, who lay
helpless on the ground; but his aide-de-camp, the Count, my father,
resolving to share his fate, flung himself by Blucher's side, and
covered him with his horse-cloak that he might not be recognised.
Over them swept a brigade of Brass Cuirassiers, so named from the
metal of their helmets and corslets.  The routed Hussars rallied
suddenly, wheeled about, and attacked their pursuers, and again
passed their fallen leader, and the old Graf--a young Graf, then--in
their pursuit of the French, whom they routed.  My father instantly
seized the opportunity.  He dragged Blucher from under the fallen
charger, mounted him on a dragoon horse, and thus saved his life!'

While Heinrich, with something of exultation, was detailing this
episode of the Count's early life, the thoughts of Carl were very far
away from the events of Ligny and Waterloo.

'Next week will see us on the march for France,' said he, 'and I may
cross the purposes of your family and the path of Ernestine no more!
You, Heinrich, who are so successful and so happy in your love, might
surely pity us.'

'I do, Carl.  A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.'

'Arrange for me,' continued Charlie, with great earnestness, 'that
Ernestine and I may have one more interview.  Our last farewell--our
separation, was so cruelly abrupt.'

'A meeting!  When and where?'

'When and where you choose.  See her once again, I must at all
hazards; and you alone can arrange this for me.  Dear friend, don't
deny us this last melancholy pleasure!'

'Where, then, think you?'

'Settle that with my darling; and may God bless you, Heinrich!' said
Charlie, in a choking voice, as he patted his friend on the epaulette.

'I shall write you to-night, to-morrow at the latest; for we must not
lose time while the Baron's gout lasts.'

And Heinrich ordered his horse and departed, leaving Charlie
Pierrepont in a more contented mood of mind than he had been in since
he left the boudoir of the Countess.

So he should _see_ her once again!




CHAPTER IX.

FOR LIFE AND DEATH.

Eagerly did Charlie Pierrepont await the arrival of the Brieftrager,
or letter-carrier, who brought him a brief note from Heinrich, saying
that he meant to take his sister for a drive that evening, and that
Charlie would find her in the little church at Burtscheid at the hour
of seven.  The note was signed, as usual, '_Ihr treuer Freund_,
HEINRICH.'  After all that had occurred, how delightful and
encouraging it was to find her brother signing himself 'Your devoted
friend,' as of old!

'The little church of Burtscheid?' said Charlie, after perusing the
note for the third or fourth time; 'it is a strange place to choose.'

But Ernestine was a strange girl, and, with regard to this farewell
meeting, had that in view which Charlie could not foresee.  Ten hours
had to elapse before the appointed one came; and to Charlie, who
passed the day almost watch in hand, the time seemed interminable.
Evening came, however, at last; and the shadows of the church spires
were falling eastward when Charlie set out for the trysting-place,
which is a mile and a half from the gates of Aix, and connected
therewith by a handsome avenue of trees.  The village is now chiefly
celebrated for its mineral waters; but 'the abbey of Burtscheid,'
says Forster, a writer at the close of the last century, 'is
beautifully situated, and finished with all ecclesiastical splendour.
Close by, a small wood runs towards a large reservoir, and as you
advance you come to a narrow valley enclosed by woody hills, where
several warm springs are soon discovered by the vapour that rises
from them, and the large reservoir is quite filled with hot water.
As you walk along a series of beautifully shaded reservoirs you see
the romantic ruins of the old castle of Frankenburg.'

Thus the trysting-place selected by Ernestine was quite near her
home.  The church was an appendage of the abbey mentioned by Forster.
It was a lonely place, surrounded by a burial-ground, where, as usual
in German cemeteries, the inventions of the mason and carpenter
rarely go beyond an urn, a cross, or a broken pillar in fashioning a
tombstone, and where, for reasons to be afterwards mentioned, few
came to promenade, as the public usually do in public burying-grounds.

At the gate stood a handsome britzka, with a pair of horses, the
reins of which were held by Heinrich, who was without groom or other
attendant.

'Ernestine?' said Charlie, grasping the hand of his friend.

'She is in the church.  We have not been here three minutes.  Do not
detain her long, Carl, as I would not have suspicion excited.
Meantime, I shall smoke a cigar.'

Charlie hastened into the edifice, for the Herr Pastor of which, in
happier times, Ernestine and Herminia had worked many altar-cloths,
pen-wipers, slippers, and smoking-caps.  It was a plain, whitewashed
edifice, ancient Gothic in some parts, patched with modern brickwork
elsewhere; and a subdued light stole through the windows on the
portraits of certain defunct Herr Pastors hung upon the pillars, the
oaken pews, and the rows of black iron spittoons in some, with
kneeling hassocks in others.  Before the rail of the altar, Ernestine
was kneeling, in prayer apparently.

There was no one else in the church, and on hearing Charlie approach,
she threw herself into his arms, and for some time could but sob
passionately and utter his name in a choking voice, while he patted
her cheek and kissed away her tears.  Then she became more composed,
and taking Charlie's face between her soft and ungloved hands, gazed
into his eyes with a tender smile.

'You will yet love me, Carl, in spite of all that mamma has said?'
she whispered.

'Love you!' he exclaimed, 'what on earth could make me cease to love
you?'

'How enchanting it is to be with you again, my own Carl!  You will
write to me from--from France, when Heinrich writes to me or
Herminia, and I can reply in the same manner.'

'Thank you, darling, for the delightful promise.'

'No power on earth must separate us, Carl.  I have resolved that such
cannot, shall not be.'

'The Baron----'

'Ah, don't speak of him at this precious time,' said she,
contemptuously; 'that odious GrÃ¼nthal--such a mouth he has!  When he
laughs you can almost see it behind him.'

'Behind him, darling--how?'

'The corners of his mouth might meet behind his head.'

This was somewhat of an exaggeration, but as it was like some of
Ernestine's speeches in merrier times, she made Charlie laugh.

'Yet, to such a man _they_ would assign you!' said he.

'If they dare!' she replied, with a little gesture, peculiarly her
own, as it was partly imperious and partly child-like.

Her tears began to flow again, and she said:

'It is in vain that the Graf storms, and that mamma tells me every
vow that has passed between us must be forgotten, that when you left
Frankenburg you lost all claim on me, and I was, and am, perfectly
free.  I am not free, Carl; I have promised to become your wedded
wife, and no other shall have my heart or hand while I live!'

She spoke with strong passion, and as she lay in the arms of her
lover, her whole delicate form was trembling violently.

'But for this war, I would implore you to take me away with you, and
make me your wife in spite of them all--your dear little wife, Carl.
Wherever you went, there Ernestine would be with you, and we should
live but for each other, and love each other as we have always done.'

'And this war once over, if God spares me, I shall come, at every
risk, at every hazard, and take you away--on this I had already
resolved, darling.'

'When that time comes, dearest Carl, I will live on your smiles by
day, and rest my head on your bosom at night.'

There was a smile on the eyes and on the lips of the girl as she
spoke, though her heart was torn by the misery of the coming
separation.  Suddenly she said:

'Kneel with me before this altar, ere some one interrupts us.  Let us
make a promise to be true to each other in life and in death----'

'Death, darling?'

'In sorrow and joy, peril and safety; sickness and health, in death
and in life!  Repeat after me, what I say.'

Clasped hand in hand, and kneeling face to face, they each promised
to be faithful, loving and true to the other, under all
circumstances, exactly as if they had been wedded, till death parted
them.  The words she dictated were strangely nervous and
solemn--solemn even to being fantastic--chilling, yet somehow
charming, and they were never forgotten by Charlie, who repeated them
after her as one in a dream.

In the usually tender eyes and soft face of Ernestine there was, for
a time, a sad yet stern expression of resolution and self-mastery,
which Charlie failed to analyze, though the memory of it long haunted
him.

'We have forged our spiritual chain, beloved Carl,' said she, 'and
cannot break it now.'

'Nor shall it ever be broken!' he replied, caressing her tenderly.

'_For life and death_ our bond be recorded in Heaven!' said the
strange romantic girl; 'kiss me, Carl, kiss me--I feel much happier
now.'

'Surely Heaven will spare me for your sake, my love.'

'If not, we shall meet there, Carl--for I should not be long behind
you, there, where there are no harsh parents, "where there is neither
marriage, nor giving in marriage,"--then we shall be re-united, Carl,
and live our dreams of love over again.'

The girl's manner was exquisitely tender, yet sad, and so earnest
that there came a time when Charlie remembered it, occasionally with
terror.  The voice of her brother was now heard.

'Heinrich is very impatient,' said Charlie.

'One moment, Carl.  If I were to come to you when dead, would you
fear me?'

'When dead?' said Charlie, looking down on the sweet upturned face
that lay on his shoulder; 'what _do_ you mean, Ernestine?'

'I scarcely know; but I should not fear _you_, love.  I have some
strange emotions in my heart this evening.  I do not think even the
grave would keep me from you; but would it keep you from me?'

'I fear it would, darling,' said he, with a half smile, though rather
bewildered by all this; 'battle trenches are often pretty deep and
full.'

'Oh, horror, Carl; don't talk of such an end as that!'

He regarded her anxiously, fearing that sudden sorrow was affecting
her mind.  Again the voice of Heinrich was heard.  She drew down the
veil of her hat to conceal the redness of her eyes, and Charlie led
her out to the britzka.  All was over now, and they were separated
till Fate or Chance should enable them to meet again.

Those who saw Ernestine looking back from the britzka, and Charlie
lift his hat more than once, as he walked slowly down the avenue that
led to Aix, could little have imagined the strangely solemn betrothal
that had just taken place between these two, in the little church of
Burtscheid.




CHAPTER X.

TO THE RHINE!

'To Paris!  To Paris!  Hoch Germania!'

Such were the cries that rang along the line of march, when on the
1st of August the various columns of the German army began to meet
those which left Paris shouting 'To Berlin!'

After detailing much that savours of what may seem romance, we have
now to borrow a paragraph or two from the history of Europe.

Perfect in organization, the forces which the Prussian Government
were able to bring to the frontier a few days after the declaration
of war against France were divided into three great armies, making a
grand total of four hundred and twelve thousand infantry, and
forty-seven thousand eight hundred cavalry, with one thousand four
hundred and forty pieces of cannon.

The first of these three armies was commanded by Major General
Steinmetz, the second by Prince Frederick Charles, and the third by
the Crown Prince--the whole being under the orders of the King of
Prussia, assisted by General Count Von Moltke, a distinguished Dane,
as chief of his staff.

Strong reserves were posted at Hainau, Frankfort, at the old
electoral city of Mayence, and amidst the vast defences of Coblentz
between the Rhine and the Moselle.  Another army defended the north,
under Von Falkenstein; so taken altogether, including the Landwehr,
Prussia, with her million and a quarter of well-drilled soldiery,
seemed impregnable.

Charlie Pierrepont's regiment was formed in brigade with the 7th, or
King's Grenadiers, and the 37th, or Westphalians.  The war
establishment of a Prussian regiment is never less than 3,006 men,
with 69 officers.  His brigade was among the first troops actively
employed, with orders to occupy the line of the Saar, resting its
right on SaarbrÃ¼ck, with advanced posts at that place and in the
schloss of the Princes of Nassau, at Saarlouis, which had been
fortified by Vauban, at Bliescastle, where the Prussians and French
fought a great battle in 1793, and at Merzig.

The second army, with the royal headquarters, crossed the Rhine at
Mayence, and took a position on the left of General Steinmetz,
occupied Zweibrucken (which the French had named Deux Ponts), and
Pirmasens, with its main body echeloned along the line of railway
from the ruined castle of the Counts of Sickingen at Landstuhl to the
strong fortress of Landau.

The third army came on by the way of Mannheim and Germesheim, and
formed to the left of the second, at the latter place, Speirs,
Neustadt, and Landau.  All these formidable columns could communicate
with each other by railway, and were well secured in the rear in case
of having to retreat.  But no thought of retreating was in the
Prussian ranks.

From the suddenness and efficiency of these arrangements, it was
clear 'that Count Bismarck and his master had been long and actively
preparing for war, and had not been entirely absorbed in peaceful and
innocent designs, as we were constantly assured by certain writers in
this country, who desired to present France to the world as a crafty
and ravening wolf, and Prussia a meek and inoffensive lamb.'

Something of this kind was said by Heinrich to Charlie, as their
brigade approached SaarbrÃ¼ck.  But the latter would scarcely admit
it, as his love for Ernestine, and his high military enthusiasm, made
him, for the time, 'German all over--German at fever-heat,' as he
said.

And splendid was the aspect of the strong brigade, with the King's
Grenadiers in front, the Westphalians in the centre, and the 95th
Thuringians in the rear, as it defiled across the bridge that led to
the suburb of St. Johann, each battalion with its carts of reserve
ammunition, drawn by six horses.  After each battalion, also, came
thirteen baggage and one canteen waggon, all the brass drums beating
smartly to make the men step quick.  The colours of the King's
Grenadiers, black and white; of the other corps, black, white, and
red--the standard of the North German Confederation--were floating in
the wind, above the long lines of spiked helmets, and of bright
bayonets and brighter musket barrels sloped in the sunshine, for the
Prussian arms are not browned as ours are now, but pure, white steel.
Hence the glitter over all the column was great, though the uniforms
were sombre and blue.

Anon the brass bands struck up between the echoing streets of
SaarbrÃ¼ck; but amid all the enthusiasm of the time, the crash of the
martial music, the measured tramping of thousands of marching feet,
Charlie's mind could not help reverting to those happy moments in the
stair of the Hoch Munster, and the sadder ones in the quiet little
church of Burtscheid, and, in memory, he still saw the rosy,
trembling lips of the girl he loved, and the full bosom that rose and
fell with sobs and sighs.

When would he be marching home, and what might happen then?  Would it
come to pass that he might never return, but find a grave in the soil
of France?  They were now within thirty miles of Metz.  He cast a
backward glance to where the rearguard was descending a slope, and,
as if to reply to his surmises, there came marching with it a corps
of grave-diggers, for a force of this kind was attached to every
column, while 'by an arrangement characterised by a grim horror, yet
unquestionably useful,' every Prussian officer and soldier was
ordered to wear round his neck a label, to establish his identity in
case of his being killed.

These reflections were but momentary, so Charlie's spirit rose again,
and his heart beat responsive to the sharp and regulated crash of the
drums; for there is much elasticity of mind in healthy twenty-eight
or thirty years, and Charlie's were no more.

The enthusiasm all over Germany was unquestionably great at this
time, and as a specimen of it, Heinrich told Charlie, exultingly, how
his father's old comrade and brother officer, Field Marshal the Count
Von Wrangel, then in the eighty-fourth year of his age, on seeing his
old regiment, the 3rd Cuirassiers, marching through Berlin, had
petitioned the king for leave to join them as a private, as he was
now too aged to lead; but the king declined the offer of the brave
old man, and requested him to remain in Berlin, and make himself
useful in a more peaceable way.

On the early morning of the 2nd of August, Charlie Pierrepont was
subaltern of the out-picket posted on the road that leads direct from
the open town of SaarbrÃ¼ck towards Metz, where then the Emperor
Napoleon III. commanded in person.  He had returned from visiting his
line of advanced sentinels, all of whom stood motionless, with musket
ordered and bayonet fixed, with their faces turned in the direction
of Metz, each longing, no doubt, for the relief and a pipe.  Stiff,
and chilled with the rain and dew of the summer night, Charlie shook
himself, as a dog might do, and proceeded to light a cigar and look
around him, as the dawn brightened, little foreseeing that this would
be one of the most important days in the new current of events.

He could see the Saar winding in and out at the foot of a chain of
hills, covered to their summits by beautiful oaks and beeches.  Here
and there the red precipices started up from the bed of the stream;
for the rocks and the soil were red, and even the river was red, too,
for rain had fallen overnight.

The scene looked lovely and peaceful.  Red stones, spotted with
orange-coloured lichens, lay plentifully in the bed of the Saar,
where a solitary kingfisher wound about among the water-weeds.  Here
and there at the narrower parts of the stream, an occasional peasant
was fishing with a tub and sink-net, and beyond lay the plain, where
Saarlouis' ramparts rose above the swampy fields, where herds of
cattle plashed disconsolately about.

'Guten morgen, Carl!' cried a familiar voice, and on looking up, he
saw Heinrich hurrying towards him.  'I have news for you.'

'Are the enemy in motion?

'As your post is an advanced one, you should be the first to know of
that.  My news is from the rear.'

'From the rear!'

'How dull you are, Carl--from Frankenburg!  Here, take a pull at my
bottle; your own is, no doubt, empty by this time.'

'Thanks!'

Charlie took a few mouthfuls from the metal flask of brandy-and-water
that Heinrich wore slung over his shoulder in a belt, and said--

'Now for your news, friend; it is not pleasant, I fear, when you
fortify me thus.'

'Anything must be pleasant that comes to us from the girls we love.
The field-post has just come.  I have a letter from Herminia, Carl,
with a little enclosure for you.'

It was a note--merely a note, on scented and tinted paper, for
Ernestine was not above these feminine prettinesses, written in her
graceful style and lady-like hand--to say that he was never absent
from her thoughts, and how she and Herminia had wept and prayed in
secret on the night the army crossed the Rhine.

'I fear, Carl, that I am looking ill and pale,' she continued, 'but
sunny-haired Herminia seems to thrive on her grief; but you know she
is ever all dimples--dimples on her white elbows and chin, cheeks,
and hands--soft jolly dimples.  Mamma, tired of knitting--she always
knits as if her livelihood depended upon it--has dozed off to sleep,
with her Spitz pug under her lace shawl in the boudoir.  (The
boudoir!  Do you ever think of it, and that horrible night when she
surprised us while searching for that miserable little cur?)  Papa,
as dinner is over, is smoking in his study, among his fishing and
shooting gear, pistols, guns, whips, collars, and whistles, no doubt
drinking to the health of the Kaiser and studying the _Staats
Anzeiger_.  All is unchanged since you left Frankenburg, from whence
my heart goes with this to you, my dearest Betrothed of Burtscheid.'

Charlie was perusing this for the third time, Heinrich was lolling
beside him on the grass, humming '_Du du_,' and idly playing with his
silver sword-knot, while watching the bright morning sunshine
stealing along the wooded hills and winding river, when suddenly
there was the report of a needle-gun in front.  Another, another, and
a third followed, as the whole line of advanced sentinels opened
fire, and the out-picket rushed to their arms and fell in their ranks.

'Sapperment!' exclaimed young Frankenburg, springing to his feet; 'it
has come at last!  This is war!  The French are in motion in front;
there will soon be work for the grave-digger corps!'

So opened the day on which the young Napoleon was to receive his
'baptism of fire.'




CHAPTER XI.

SEPARATED.

For a time the preparations for her marriage had gone on
openly--though Ernestine, in her tenderness of heart and reluctance
to wound one she loved so well, made no reference to this in her
short letter--so openly that there were times when she contemplated
flight; but whither could she fly? and then she shrunk from the
dreadful _esclandre_ of such a proceeding; so settlements were made
and deeds signed, and from time to time she found beautiful ornaments
and jewels, the gifts of the Baron, on her toilette tables; but she
never wore them, and the morocco cases remained unopened; till at
last a serious illness, or sickness of the heart, in fact,
supervened, and the espousals were delayed, and the Count cursed the
hour that his thoughtless son had brought his troublesome English
comrade to Frankenburg.

She was no longer _espiÃ¨gle_, as of old; the piano remained unopened
now, and no entreaties on the part of her father could lure her into
playing 'Die Wacht am Rhein,' the war-song of Arndt, or any of those
stirring and patriotic airs with which all Germany was resounding
now.  The very sound of the instrument fretted her.

Times there had been when she had tried over some of those songs she
had loved to sing to Charlie Pierrepont--the same that she had been
rehearsing on the evening of his arrival (how much had happened since
then!)--but she fairly broke down and made the attempt no more.

A summons from Prince Bismarck, for the Baron GrÃ¼nthal to attend at
Berlin, in consequence of some affairs connected with the
Oberconsistory Court at Aix, gave poor Ernestine a temporary respite
from the annoyance of his presence and clumsy attentions; and as she
was at times easier in mind, and more content to wait the issue of
events, after that remarkable and somewhat solemn interchange of
promises at Burtscheid Church, her parents began to hope that all was
at an end between her and the Herr Lieutenant of Infantry, and that
she would be content to receive the Baron as her husband in time,
perhaps when Heinrich returned, if God spared him ever to return.

This was satisfactory to her on one hand, while on the other she had
the pleasure of sharing her secret sorrows and hopes of future joy
with Herminia, with whom she had now a double link and bond of
sympathy.

They led but a dull life now in the old Schloss.

Baron Rhineberg, 'a beer-bloated Teuton' of the first class, came
occasionally to talk politics with the Count, over a pipe and flask
of Rhine wine; the two daughters of the Justiz-rath, and a few other
visitors, dropped in, but Ernestine found it weary work to talk
commonplaces with these people, not one of whom had any vital or
particular interest, beyond a national one, in the army now in the
field; and to chat of music and books, of Berlin wools and soup for
the poor, when, perhaps, _at that very moment of time_, the bullets
might be whistling about him she loved; or when he might be stretched
wounded, dying or dead, upon the bloody sod--to talk, we say, of
aught that was frivolous, with such fears in her heart, was
impossible.

Strong, yet tender, was thus the bond of sympathy between the
cousins; for those whom they loved--the one openly, the other
secretly--and to whom they were affianced, were facing side by side
the foes of Germany, and risking the same perils and toils.

Once only did she rouse herself thoroughly and feel startled when the
portly Baron Rhineberg, taking his vast pipe out from his bushy
moustaches, asked her abruptly if she 'ever visited the church of
Burtscheid.'

'Sometimes,' said she, colouring deeply for a moment, and then
becoming pale as before; 'but why do you ask, Herr Baron?'

'Because Herr Pastor Puffenvortz is preaching a series of stirring
sermons there just now.'

Poor Ernestine, who had begun to fear that her interview there with
Charlie had been overheard or overseen by some eavesdropper unknown,
felt greatly relieved by the Baron's simple reply; but her sudden
change of colour was not unnoticed by the Countess, who drew certain
conclusions therefrom, though she could scarcely give them any form.

The sudden and blunt reference to the church at Burtscheid, the scene
of her last and farewell interview with Charlie, gave her so sudden a
shock--her sensibility had become so delicate now--that she had to
retire to her room.

Burtscheid!  All the scene then came again before her--when words
were spoken that were known to Heaven and themselves alone!  He was
gone--torn from her, the first and only man she had ever loved, so
the girl pined in her heart.  So now she sat, as she had been wont to
sit for hours, listlessly, as if without consciousness of thought;
yet her mind was keenly active and full of images of the absent one.

To the latter, variety of occupation, change of scene in a foreign
land, the activity of a military life, the incessant stir and alarms
of war, would, in spite of love, separation, and fear of rivalry and
of her family, draw in fresh moods of thought and afford thereby a
certain healthy relief; but she was left amid the scenes of her
departed joy, with the additional affliction before her of domestic
persecution and the odious addresses of a would-be lover!

How eagerly she hoped that he would be detained for months at Berlin!

'Oh, Herminia!' she would sometimes say to her cousin; 'I was so
happy--so happy, that it is a sin to make me so miserable!'

'Be calm, darling, be calm; Heinrich will bring him to you once
again,' replied the girl, embracing her.

'It will be miraculous if they _both_ escape the dangers of this
mighty war.'

'Do not speak thus, I implore you,' said Herminia, passionately, and
somewhat scared by her cousin's tone of voice and expression of eye.

'My sufferings are indeed great, Herminia.  Do you remember,' she
asked, with a sad smile, 'all you endured at Cologne, when you only
knew Heinrich as Herr Mansfeld?'

'Never, never shall I forget them, and the agony that I suffered on
one particular evening, when I heard you laughing, and deemed you
heartless, dear cousin.  How I then loathed the name of Heinrich--it
seems wonderful now!'

'So now do I loathe that of the Baron.  Oh, Herminia, few like me
have to endure misery without the prospect of relief!'

In the evening after Rhineberg had withdrawn, the Countess, whose
mind was still running on her daughter's evident emotion at the name
of Burtscheid, gave vent to the anger and suspicion that excited her.

'Did you ever _go_ to Burtscheid with Herr Pierrepont?' she asked
abruptly.

'Never, mamma,' replied Ernestine, blushing again, but at her own
quibble rather than the question of her mother, who, after eyeing her
narrowly, almost sternly for a minute, said--

'You still pine for that insolent young man.  I can see it in your
face, Ernestine!'

'Oh, mamma!' said the girl, with a wonderful tenderness of tone, 'is
it a crime to love?'

'Not if it is a proper love.'

'Then why, mamma darling, are you so severe on _me_?' asked
Ernestine, nestling in her mother's neck in the most endearing manner.

'I wish to protect and guide you, and to teach you that you must not
love one who is beneath you.'

'But, dear Carl----' (The adjective escaped her unconsciously.)

'Grafine!' exclaimed the astonished Countess.

'Well, mamma, Carl Pierrepont is not beneath me.'

'This is new to me--how?'

'Because, even if he were so, love makes all equal.'

By kisses and caresses she strove to win over her mother; but the
latter almost thrust her back, saying:

'This is folly--worse than folly; crush, forget, dismiss such
thoughts.  They are unworthy of you, Ernestine--unworthy of _my_
daughter!'

'And of mine, too,' added the Count, who had come unnoticed upon the
scene.  'Der Teufel! much as I liked that English lad, I hope some
French bullet may rid us of him for ever.'

'Oh, father,' implored Ernestine, 'spare me such terrible remarks.
Think of his old father and his three sisters in England.  Think that
our Heinrich shares his dangers.'

'True--true; God forgive me the thought; but go to your room, child,
and let us have no more scenes like this,' replied the old Count, who
had long outlived the memory of what a young love was, and Ernestine
gladly obeyed.

The expression of her face changed at times; its softness seemed to
pass away, and then contempt and anger mingled with sorrow on her
white lips.  She was a spirited yet a gentle girl; she felt that she
had been insulted, and treated like a child; that her natural freedom
had been trampled on, her wishes ignored, and in the long waking
hours of the silent night, when no sound was heard but the hooting of
the owls in the ruined tower close by, she brooded, almost
revengefully, upon the pride and tyranny of her parents, and the
gross insolence--for such she justly deemed it--of the Baron
GrÃ¼nthal, seeking her hand without her affection--her hand in
defiance of herself and her avowed love for another!

Then it was, in times such as these, that wild and impotent schemes
of flight and freedom occurred--schemes from which she shrank when
daylight came.

Ernestine looked ere long careworn and became ill; her physician
recommended the baths at different places, and the mineral waters
elsewhere; but they were resorted to in vain.  One little enclosure
from Carl, received secretly in the letters of Herminia, was worth
all the baths and wells in Germany to Ernestine.

One evening Baron Rhineberg came galloping to the Schloss, and from
his vast rotundity was ushered into the drawing-room when on the
verge of an apoplectic fit.  His features were purple, his eyes
rolled wildly in their sockets, and from mingled excitement and
enthusiasm, the burly old Teuton could only splutter and utter some
incoherent sounds, while the Spitz pug barked furiously.

'Ach Gott!' exclaimed the Count; 'what is the matter?'

'Have you not heard the news, Herr Count?' he gasped.

'News!' repeated Frankenburg, changing colour, and mechanically, or
by use and wont, playing with the pipe that dangled at his button,
for even he did not smoke in the drawing-room, though a thorough
German.

'But of course you could not, for I have just come from the city,'
said Rhineberg.

'Der Teufel!' said Frankenburg, angrily, 'and what may the news be?'

'The advanced column of the German army has come to blows with the
French at last.'

'At last!' said the Count, with something of pride mingling in his
irritation; 'I don't think the Kaiser has lost much time.'

'Our troops were attacked, at least so the telegram says, by the
French, led by the Emperor Napoleon in person.'

'Where--where?' asked all his listeners, while the three ladies grew
very pale indeed.

'At SaarbrÃ¼ck.'

'The devil!' exclaimed the Count; 'that is actually on our Prussian
ground.'

'SaarbrÃ¼ck?' re-echoed the Countess and Herminia, in faint voices,
for they both knew that Heinrich was with the advanced column there.

Ernestine knew that her Carl was there too; but no sound left her
white and quivering lips.

'And what were the results of the conflict--the casualties, and so
forth?' asked the old Count, his mind flashing back to the days of
Ligny, Wavre, and Waterloo.

'Unknown as yet.  The first man killed is said to be an _Englishman_.'

'Gott in Himmel!' cried the Count, 'my girl has fainted!'

So at Frankenburg, as at many other places, where the hearts of the
people were with the flower of Germany, they could but wait and
pray--pray and be patient till true tidings came.




CHAPTER XII.

THE BAPTISM OF FIRE.

It was no false alarm that, as related in a preceding chapter, made
the advanced sentinels of the 95th, all hardy fellows from the
Thuringerwald, open fire in quick succession.

The Emperor Napoleon, who had recently arrived at Metz, looking old
and ill, with his head sunk on his breast, and who, on the 28th of
July, had issued that famous bulletin, 'Soldiers, the eyes of the
world are upon you!  The fate of civilization depends upon our
success.  Soldiers, let each one do his duty, and the God of armies
will be with us!'--the Emperor, we say, finding that the time had
come when something must be done to stimulate the spirit of those
troops whom he had massed in and about Metz, as well as to appease
the fiery impatience of the French people, being aware that SaarbrÃ¼ck
was of importance to the Prussians, who there had command of three
lines of railway for the conveyance of troops and stores, resolved to
carry the place by storm.

Hence, about nine o'clock on the morning of the 2nd of August, the
gleam of bayonets was seen on some heights that overlook the town,
and the dark columns of the French, in their long blue coats, and red
or madder-coloured breeches, became visible, and by that time the
whole Prussian force in and about SaarbrÃ¼ck was under arms, and their
cannon went thundering to the front.

Over the brass-spiked helmets, the brass-pointed pickel-haubes, with
the spread eagle, rose forests of bayonets, a steelly sea flashing in
the sunshine, the Uhlans riding with pennons furled and lances down
on the flanks of the massed close columns.  Anon the drums beat
sharply, then the hoarse German words of command rang out on the
clear air, the colours rustled on the morning breeze, and rays of
light seemed to pass over all the force as the columns deployed into
line, elbow touching elbow, loosely, and the order was given to
load--to load those terrible needle-guns which carried death and
destruction into the Austrian ranks in the war of 1866.  They are
simply breech-loading rifles, in which the charge is exploded by the
projection of a piece of steel, called 'the needle,' on the
detonating powder.  The Prussians, whenever they encountered the
French, allowed them to exhaust the fire of their chassepots at long
range; then they poured in their own with deadly accuracy; and next
came the bayonet charge--and those who have seen the Prussians charge
will never forget the impression conveyed by their levelled ridge of
steel, the shining helmets, the hoarse hurrahs, the flushed, yet
resolute faces, the whole physique of the rushing infantry, and the
roar of the trumpets as the Uhlans went thundering on their flanks,
whirling their tremendous spears, as if impatient to close with the
foe.

All this did Charlie Pierrepont see on this eventful day at SaarbrÃ¼ck.

Ere the Prussians formed line, the booming of their artillery was
heard in front; a great deal of wood surrounded the town, and from
this, as from an ambuscade, their cannon were fired, and high in the
air rose the white smoke above the green foliage* With shouts of '_A
bas la Prusse!_' the 2nd French corps, under General Bataille, came
rushing on, only to be checked and decimated by the biting cannonade;
the grassy slope that led to the heights was soon dotted by killed
and wounded, and the stretchers and ambulance waggons made their
appearance along the whole line of route.

'What is the meaning of those cheers on the right?' asked Captain
SchÃ¶nforst, a tall soldier-like fellow of the 95th, of Charlie, who
was busy scanning the enemy through his field-glass; 'are those
dragoons coming in from Forbach?'

'By Heaven, I think it is the Emperor in person, surrounded by a
brilliant staff, with a little boy riding by his side!' was the
excited response of Pierrepont.

And the Emperor it was, accompanied by the Prince Imperial, then in
his fourteenth year.

'Tell the officer commanding that gun near us who these new arrivals
are,' said SchÃ¶nforst, a veteran of the Austro-Prussian war,' and
desire him to send a few doses of grape in their direction.'

Charlie promptly delivered the order; the direction of the gun was
altered, and thus it was that the young prince received what was
popularly known as his 'baptism of fire.'

'He was admirably cool,' wrote the Emperor to the Empress; 'we were
in front of the line, and the bullets fell at our feet.  Louis has
kept one which fell close to him.  Some of the soldiers shed tears on
seeing him so calm.'

Filled with enthusiasm by all this, General Froissard despatched two
battalions of the 67th regiment, under Colonel Theobaudin, to attack
the hamlet of St. Arnaul, which was occupied by our friends the
Thuringians, and was further defended by batteries of guns on the
right flank of the Saar.  The 15th French regiment made a rush at
those batteries, and captured them with great bravery.  Theobaudin's
battalion, supported now by the 40th and 66th regiments, and some
mitrailleuses--those horrible weapons, now for the first time tried
in active warfare--made a furious attack on the village of St. Arnaul.

Shoulder to shoulder stood the resolute Thuringians--the lineal
descendants of the ancient Hyrcinian foresters--volleying over wall
and bank and hedge with their deadly needle-guns; but the French came
rushing up the slope with glorious _Ã©lan_, though hundreds went
rolling down, dead or dying, and choking in blood.

With those dreadful showers of balls, the mitrailleuses, 'those
master-pieces for death and carnage,' were heard amid the roar of the
musketry by the strange noise of their discharge, which was dry,
shrieking, and terrible!

Their balls in continuous streams tore thtough the Prussian ranks,
mowing them down as scythes mow a field of corn.  Everywhere the
smoke was dense.  Heinrich had an epaulette torn off by one bullet,
and the spike of his helmet by another, while Charlie was twice on
the point of being taken prisoner, when his company was skirmishing
in front, at the time when the 8th and 23rd French regiments were
also in skirmishing order through some thickly wooded ravines.  Two
powerful soldiers attacked him--in fact, he had run against them in
the smoke--and he must inevitably have been killed or taken had he
not rid himself of one with his revolver, while Captain SchÃ¶nforst
passed his long straight sword through the body of the other.

But the Prussian drums were now beating a retreat.  It was impossible
for the small force in SaarbrÃ¼ck--a mere weak advanced guard--to
withstand the many battalions sent against it by the Emperor,
especially as the attacking force was supported by an entire battery
of mitrailleuses.

The affair was a skirmish rather than a battle, and ended by the town
being set on fire, and the thick columns of smoke from the burning
houses rose from amid the trees, rolled along the railway
embankments, and added to the obscurity and confusion.  Amid this
rang the roar of the red flashing musketry, and the horrible
shrieking of the mitrailleuse.  The latter we may describe for the
information of the reader is a four-pound gun, divided into
twenty-five compartments by as many rifle barrels, all loaded at the
breech by cartridges, and all discharged at once, the loading only
requiring five actions, by which seven thousand eight hundred balls
can be discharged in one hour into a circle of twelve feet in
diameter.

It was by the fire of one of these that Charlie saw an event which
was one of the most touching scenes in the war.  His skirmishers had
been driven by the French 23rd close to the railway bank, and near
them lay a Zouave, terribly wounded in the lungs apparently.  The
poor man's agony was frightful.  He was past speech, and could only
clasp his hands in prayer, cross himself, and point imploringly to
his mouth.

A kindly sergeant of the 95th uncorked his water-bottle, and raising
the Frenchman's head, was about to slake his thirst, when the
shrieking sound was heard amid the smoke close by.  Out of that smoke
came the leaden storm of the mitrailleuse, and the Prussian and the
Zouave were literally blown to fragments.

Over the railway bank the Thuringians were now driven, and everywhere
the whole Prussian line was giving way!  The moment the Emperor
became aware of this, with generous humanity he ordered the
mitrailleuses to cease firing, and thus arrested the useless carnage.

As yet Charlie Pierrepont had escaped without a scratch, though
frequently the very sod beneath his feet was torn and sowed by balls.
Though the French obtained possession of SaarbrÃ¼ck--the last troops
out of which were the Thuringians--the Prussians still continued to
lurk in the village of St. Johann, on the further side of the Saar,
and in the thick woods beyond it, from whence the white smoke spirted
out in incessant puffs as their well-concealed skirmishers kept up a
galling fire on the enemy.

This gradually ceased, and the shadows of evening began to deepen
over SaarbrÃ¼ck, and on the faces of the dead and dying who lay by the
sedgy banks of the once peaceful river.  The fishers had fled,
abandoning their tubs and baskets; no figures were seen moving on
either side now save those of men in various uniforms; and terrified
by the unnatural din that then had seemed to rend the sky, the little
birds were seen to grovel amid the reeds and grass, as if too scared
to seek their nests in those thickets around which the tide of
carnage rolled.

The advanced sentinels were posted for the night, and under the
shelter of a shattered cottage wall.  Charlie Pierrepont, Heinrich,
and Captain SchÃ¶nforst congratulated each other that they all escaped
untouched, and sat down amid the _debris_ of what had once been a
cabbage-garden, to enjoy an humble repast, some German sausage, a few
slices of bread, and the contents of their water-bottles, dashed with
cognac.

The telegram which, on that same evening, the Baron Rhineberg so duly
reported at Frankenburg, thereby piercing, as with a poniard, the
heart of Ernestine, was correct in some of its details, as the
_first_ man killed in the Franco-Prussian war was an Englishman--but
not Charlie.

Prior to the affair at SaarbrÃ¼ck, twenty Baden troopers, led by a Mr.
Winslow, made a dash into France at Lauterburg, and galloping on as
far as Niederbronn, in open daylight, cut all the telegraph wires
along the line of railway there.  They halted next morning to
breakfast at a French farmhouse, when they were surprised, and, in
the combat that ensued, Winslow was cut down and slain.

The terror and anxiety of Ernestine were, however, short-lived, as
Heinrich's letter, written next morning, contained an enclosure for
her that gave her a blessed relief.




CHAPTER XIII.

THE DREAM IN THE BIVOUAC.

In talking over the stirring events of the past day, Captain
SchÃ¶nforst sat drawing out his fair fly-away whiskers to their full
length, and then stuffing them into his mouth, as if to stifle his
indignation at the Emperor Napoleon, for, like many other German
officers at this time, he was loud in condemning him for bringing the
Prince Imperial, a mere boy, under fire.

'You forget, Herr Captain,' said Charlie, 'that princes have a great
political game to play in this world, and that the heir of a throne
should always be a soldier.'

'But a boy--a mere boy--to be brought into action!' persisted the
Captain.

'Well.  The sooner his nerves are strung, the better, I think; and we
must remember that boys are employed in navies as well as in armies,
and it is no more inhuman to have a prince under fire than a
midshipman or drummer boy.'

So the worthy captain was convinced, though much against his will.

We have no intention of afflicting the reader with a history of the
terrible Franco-Prussian war; but we cannot omit the details of some
of those events in which Charlie Pierrepont and his comrades, the
Thuringians, bore a share.

Serious disasters followed the slight success won by the French at
SaarbrÃ¼ck, when the Crown Prince of Prussia, two days after, made a
furious attack on their right flank, which rested on a high hill
called the Geisberg, just within the frontier of France and a little
south-east of SaarbrÃ¼ck.  All round the Geisberg the country is hilly
and woody, with cultivated fields, detached cottages nestling among
vines and flowers, and here and there pretty little hamlets.

Just as grey dawn stole in on the morning of the 4th of August, and
when the French troops on the Geisberg were cooking their breakfasts
and drinking their coffee quietly between their piles of arms, and
looking from time to time into the beautiful pastoral valley,
suddenly a storm of shells burst over them.  The air seemed alive
with fire and falling bombs, while, at the same moment, the whole
town of Weissenburg, close by, burst into flames.

Unseen by, and unknown to the French, the Crown Prince of Prussia had
established a terrible battery of guns on the heights of Schweigen, a
village on the other side of the river, and these guns were supported
by a vast force, variously estimated from 50,000 to 100,000 men.

On and about the Geisberg were only 10,000 French troops.

The country on the Bavarian side of the Lauter is so thickly wooded,
that the approach of the Crown Prince's army was quite concealed; not
a bayonet flashed out from amid the foliage; not a standard was seen
to waver; hence the men on the Geisberg suddenly found themselves
confronted by a vast host that crossed the river at various points,
the first to plunge in being the Thuringians, with stentorian shouts
of

'Vorwarts!  Vorwarts!  Hoch Germania!'

A young fÃ¤hnrich (or ensign), a mere boy, carrying the King's colour,
was shot through the head, and was being swept down the stream with
the pole in his grasp, when SchÃ¶nforst wrenched it away; and the
standard, all bloody and dripping, was shouldered by another
subaltern.

Pierrepont could see nothing of what was being done at any other
point than where his regiment crossed; but in a few minutes he found
himself out of the water, and into clouds of smoke, through gaps in
which, when made by the morning breeze, he could see the dusky
columns of the enemy--the red-breeched Zouaves in their variegated
Oriental costume, their necks bare, and their bearded faces dark and
brown, and a corps of Voltigeurs in blue faced with white.

Up the Geisberg went the Prussian troops, cheering, and with a
rush--up so fast that the mounted officers were cantering their
horses--and with a rush the hill was carried, after a short, sharp
hand-to-hand conflict, though here the dark, savage Turcos fought
with desperation and incredible bravery, charging many times with the
bayonet, though their ranks were torn to pieces by grape-shot.

General Douay, commanding the French, was here killed by a shell.
His fate was a very melancholy one, and a noble instance of
self-sacrifice.

On seeing the battle hopelessly lost, he stood sadly apart on a
little mound, watching the last desperate struggles of his
fast-falling infantry.  He then issued some final orders to the
officers of his staff, and began to descend the slope of the mound
alone.  At its base he dismounted, and slaying his horse, as Roland
did at the battle of Roncesvalles (but with a pistol), he drew his
sword, and began to ascend the opposite slope of the Geisberg.

'Where are you going, Monsieur le General?' cried some of his
soldiers, in astonishment.

'To meet the enemy,' he replied, through his clenched teeth.

They continued to dissuade him, but in vain.  Sword in hand he
continued to advance, calmly and alone, till a passing shell struck
him dead.

General Montmarie, and many other brave officers, fell at the head of
their men; and, on this day, was inaugurated that series of rapid
disasters to France that never ended till the Prussian drums woke the
echoes of the Arc de Triomphe at Paris.

The troops were considerably broken as they fought their way up the
hill, and some of the King's Grenadiers got mingled among the 95th.
Carl missed Heinrich from his place on the left of the company.
'Heavens!' thought he, 'has he fallen?'

Looking round, even at the risk of being struck by a bullet from
behind, he saw him about fifty yards in the rear, in the grasp of a
savage-looking and powerfully built Turco, whose left hand was on
Heinrich's throat, while, with his unfixed bayonet, the socket of
which he grasped dagger-fashion in his right, he was making vain
efforts to stab and thrust--we say vain efforts, for, though Heinrich
had lost his sword in the fray, he had firm possession of the Turco's
right wrist.

While the two were wrenching and swaying to and fro, the black eyes
of the swarthy Turco flashing fire, and his teeth glistening white as
he hissed and muttered curses through them, a second Turco, not far
off, took aim at Heinrich with his chassepot, and fired, but missed.
He threw open the breech of the weapon to insert another cartridge;
but ere he could close it, Pierrepont, quick as thought, snatched a
needle-gun from the nearest soldier, took steady aim at him, and
fired.  The ball pierced the left side of the Turco, who bounded
three feet from the ground, made a kind of half-turn in the air, and
then fell flat on his face motionless.

When the smoke cleared away, Charlie saw his friend with a breathless
and half-strangled expression hurrying towards him, having been freed
from the Turco by the bayonet of a Westphalian.  He had saved her
brother; and from that gory field, his heart--his thoughts--flashed
home to Ernestine.

It was now two o'clock p.m.; by this time the French were in full and
rapid retreat, followed by the Prussian flying artillery, as they
fell back upon the line of Bitsch.  The Geisberg was won, but the
slaughter on both sides was terrible.  The French fought nobly.
Fourteen men of the 24th regiment were all that were left _alive_ of
that corps at the close of the day; and even those refused to
surrender, but kept fighting on at the point of the bayonet until the
Prussians, not liking to kill them, rushed upon them in a body and
threw them down by wrestling.

On the corpse-encumbered Geisberg the glorious old valour of France
was conspicuous as ever; but her troops were badly officered and
badly led.

Night came down on the field; the quiet stars were reflected in the
placid bosom of the river, and heavy were the moans, and loud
sometimes the screams of anguish from the wounded.  The sisters of
charity began to flit about like good angels, and the bells were rung
in Weissenberg to muster the firemen for the burial of the dead.

To follow the 96th in detail through all the subsequent operations
would be foreign to our story; suffice it that after the attack by
the Crown Prince on the 6th of August, and the outflanking of Marshal
MacMahon, after the desperate battle at Worth, Charlie Pierrepont and
young Frankenburg found themselves still without a wound, hurrying in
pursuit of the fugitive French, who were in full retreat towards
Strasburg.

Their brigade halted for the night, and bivouacked among some
vineyards near a little village.

Now that he had been so often under fire, Charlie Pierrepont looked
back with surprise to the days when, in Frankenburg, he had hoped
that a French bullet might kill him!  But that was before he had told
his love and had been accepted; before that happy day in the Dom
Kirche.

Life seemed very different now; it was both precious and valuable!

The staff officers occupied all the cottages in the village, so
Charlie, like other regimental officers, had to sleep among his men;
and thus, weary and worn, Charlie muffled himself in his ample blue
cloak, and with his sword and revolver beside him, went to roost
under the shelter of a haystack.  Undisturbed by the falling dew, by
the occasional beat of a drum or sound of a trumpet, as the
field-officers of the night paraded and inspected the out-pickets,
the hoarse challenges of the German sentinels, and the clatter of
ambulance waggons carrying wounded to the rear, he slept soundly, yet
not so soundly as not to have after some strange rambling flights
about old Rugby, and a delicious dream of Ernestine, which from its
vividity made a great impression on him then, and was to make a still
greater, when a future episode came to pass.

In the visions of the night she came to him as distinctly as she had
ever appeared to him in reality, and bent over him tenderly and
pityingly, as he lay there in that miserable bivouac, with a bundle
of hay under his head, and he heard her murmuring softly--oh, so
softly, in his ear--

  'My darling, my own darling!'


Then, as a gush of her nature, which was ever passionate, deep, and
earnest, came over her, she knelt by his side ere he could rise, and
drew his head lovingly and caressingly on her soft breast, with her
hands clasped under his chin--

'Oh, my Carl, how weary and how worn you look!' she continued,
kissing his cheek, on which her tears were falling, while the light
of love, triumph, and joy shone in her beautiful eyes.

'I think of you by day and night, my love, my wife, my own wife that
is to be,' murmured Carl in his sleep; 'you are indeed my guardian
angel.'

He pressed her to his breast, and starting, awoke, to find it all but
a _dream_; that the clock of the French village was striking the hour
of _three_, and that around him were the weary Thuringians, sleeping
in their blue greatcoats and spiked helmets, between their piles of
loaded muskets, but to his half-awakened senses her voice seemed to
linger in his ear, and he still felt her soft warm kiss on his lips.

He closed his eyes and strove to sleep, in the hope of that dear
vision coming back again; but he strove in vain: he was thoroughly
awakened now; so dreams or slumber come no more to Charlie Pierrepont.

The dawn of the 7th August came in, and the Prussian troops began
their march on Forbach.




CHAPTER XIV.

THE LETTER OF ERNESTINE.

The events of the war succeeded each other with frightful speed.
Marshal MacMahon's spirited address to the army and his promise,
'with God's help, soon to take a brilliant revenge,' failed to
inspire with courage the troops of France, whose military prowess
seemed gone.  The excitement in the army and at Paris grew terrible.
SaarbrÃ¼ck was retaken by the Prussians; the French were again
defeated at Forbach; vast bodies of prisoners taken in battle or by
capitulation began to pour through the towns of Germany, where they
were kindly received; the once great Empire of France seemed
tottering to its fall, and on the 13th of August the Prussian scouts
were at Pont-Ã -Mousson, on the Moselle.

Then, more fully to cut off MacMahon's communications with Metz, the
95th Thuringians, now greatly reduced in strength by fighting, and
other troops, took post in the pleasant valley where the river
divides the town in two parts.  The town was soon filled by Prussian
troops, but the hardy Thuringians pitched their tents near a village
on the bank of the river, on a pretty wooded slope; and there on the
first evening of the halt, Charlie received some intelligence from
Frankenburg, which caused him much perplexity and thought.

Most of the furniture from the village had been brought into camp;
before the tent of Captain SchÃ¶nforst stood a table and chairs, and
there he, with Charlie, Heinrich, and two other officers, sat smoking
and drinking, and making merry, while their servants prepared a
repast for them.

The aspect of the camp was very picturesque; it was now the beginning
of evening, the August sun was sinking behind a wooded mountain
range, the 'blue Moselle' looked bluer than ever between its green
and fertile banks, and the rooks were cawing noisily overhead in the
stately old beeches, amid which the tents of the 95th were pitched.

A single day's halt had enabled the officers to remove all the mud of
the march; parade suits of uniform with fresh lace had been donned in
lieu of old 'fighting jackets;' boots were polished and spurs
burnished, and SchÃ¶nforst wore a sword of which he was justly vain,
as he had received it from the hands of King William after a battle
in the campaign of 1866, when he was but a feldwebel, but won his
silver shoulder-straps by bravery.

On all sides the men were cleaning their muskets, cutting wood,
lighting fires, carrying water from the stream, singing merrily, and
many of them in chorus.

'Well, SchÃ¶nforst,' said one of his guests, Herr Donnersberg, a
thoughtless young fÃ¤hnrich, 'I feel that I have an appetite--what is
your speise-karte for to-day?'

'The bill of fare shows rather an omnium gatherum,' replied the
Captain, thrusting nearly half a pound of tobacco into the bowl of
his pipe; 'but the chief feature in it is a goose, now broiling on
ramrods.  One of our foragers gave it to me this morning for a couple
of kreutzers and a bottle of cognac.'

'Excellent!' replied the other, 'though it is a bird, which an
English gourmand said "was too much for one, but not quite enough for
two."

'Here is my contribution to the repast,' said Heinrich, producing
from his tent a square case bottle of prime Geneva 'per Johann de
Kuy, Rotterdam,' which he had picked up somewhere on the march.

'So, as we have nothing better than Geneva and beer,' said the
Captain, 'it will be useless to discuss the question as to the aroma
of Veuve Clicquot, as compared with that of sparkling hock or
Sillery.'

'Hock!' cried the other; 'wait till our drums are ringing among the
vineyards of Champagne!'

The goose was pronounced excellent, and soon disappeared with all
SchÃ¶nforst's own viands; the bowled pipes were again resorted to, and
when Charlie produced a bottle of cognac from his tent, the serious
business of the evening began, with the usual amount of rough
military joking; and SchÃ¶nforst was making them all laugh noisily and
heartily, with an account of how Herr Major Rumpenfalz, just before
the Westphalians marched, had married the frolicsome widow of a
Hofrath, and on waking in the morning found his bride's golden hair
on the toilette table, and her pearly teeth in the tumbler out of
which the Herr Major was about to take his matutinal draught of cold
water.  While they were still laughing at this, or rather at the
manner in which SchÃ¶nforst related it, an officer who was passing
suddenly paused, and--

'A glass with you, gentlemen!'

'With pleasure,' replied SchÃ¶nforst, handing him a bumper of brandy
and water.

'The Kaiser!' said the stranger, on which all started to their feet
and drank the toast, standing with their caps off.  Though wearing
the usual spike-helmet, a plain blue surtout, with silver
shoulder-straps, and a little eight-pointed cross at his neck, in the
closely shaven face, the resolute mouth and square jaws, the stern
grey eyes and aquiline nose of their visitor, they all recognised the
Count Von Moltke--the spirit of the war, 'that embodied fate who
prepared in mystery and gloom the blows that were to fall on mighty
armaments, and in a few weeks to reduce great military powers to ruin
and humiliation.'

'I have news for you, gentlemen,' said he.  'The Emperor has resigned
the command of the French army to Marshal Bazaine, so he will have to
make the great stand at Metz, where he has one hundred and forty
thousand men, with two hundred and eighty pieces of cannon.'

He then put two fingers to the peak of his helmet, and walked slowly
away, leaving them to discuss the probable turn events might take
now; but jollity was soon resumed.

Charlie was rather silent and thoughtful; for sooth to say, the vivid
nature of his dream still haunted him; and Heinrich, who knew well
where his thoughts were, gave him a clap on the epaulette, and began
to sing a verse of an old love song:

  THE CARRIER PIGEON.

  'They that behold me little dream
  How wide my spirit soars from them,
  And, borne on fancy's pinions, roves
  To seek the glorious form it loves.

  'Know that a faithful herald flies
  To bear her image to my eyes,
  My constant thought for ever telling
  How fair she is, all else excelling!'


'Pass the bottle, Carl,' he added; 'let us be merry; weep when you
must, but laugh when you can.  Vive la bagatelle! as these Frenchmen
have it.'

At that moment a Uhlan came spurring into camp with letters for the
brigade from the field post; those for the 95th were soon
distributed: there was one for Heinrich from Herminia, with another
for Charlie enclosed, and both became at once deep in their contents
by the last light of the sun.  Ernestine's letter was very long, and
so crossed and recrossed that the perusal of it occupied a long time.
Ere he had read a few lines, Heinrich said:

'I do not know whether I should show you this, Carl.'

'What?'

'A passage in Herminia's letter.'

'About whom?' asked Charlie anxiously.

'Ernestine--my sister.'

'Read it, pray; anything is better than suspense.'

'Herminia writes, "Poor Ernestine seems to fret fearfully.  There is
a flush on her cheeks such as often precedes but more often follows
pallor; and all her actions, figure, and manner are indicative of
listlessness and ill-health."'

'My poor darling!' said Charlie, in a low agitated voice.

'"Surely her mamma will have some pity upon her," continued Herminia;
"the Baron GrÃ¼nthal has returned to Aix, and though his gout still
continues----"'

'Praised be Plutus!' commented Charlie; 'I wish the nasty old beast
was at the bottom of the Red Sea.'

'"And though it does not improve his temper, he has become very
anxious and importunate."'

'Curse him!  I hope the gout may get into his Excellency's stomach.'

'"The Count and Countess begin to hint now that as the war will too
probably be a protracted one, it was unwise to wait for Heinrich's
presence at this odious marriage.  How Aunt Adelaide pores over the
_Gazettes_--those dreadful _Gazettes_!"  And now, Herr Carl, all that
follows are little _bon-bons_ for my own perusal.'

Innocent Herminia little knew that her aunt watched the war
_Gazettes_ with the double hope that Heinrich's name was not in them,
and that Charlie's _was_--or might be.

Poor Charlie!  Her ladyship was to be gratified one day, however.

'What news from Ernestine?' asked Heinrich, when Charlie had finished
the perusal of _his_ letter; 'I feel as anxious about these girls at
Frankenburg, as if I was Rip Van Winkle after his long snooze in the
Sleepy Hollow.'

But Charlie made no reply; he sat with the letter in his hand, and
lost in thought.

'What is the matter, my friend?' asked Heinrich.  'There is something
more in your letter than there is in mine?'

'There is, indeed!' replied Charlie, in a strange voice, as he
drained his glass.

'Good news?'

'No, Heinrich.'

'Bad news, then?'

'No, thank Heaven!' replied Charlie fervently.

'What, then, agitates you?'

'That which I cannot tell you.  That which you cannot understand.'

'Carl!' exclaimed Heinrich.

'Pardon me--another time, and I may tell you.  Oh, Heinrich, your
sister, Ernestine, is indeed the world's one woman to me!' he
exclaimed, with deep emotion; and, heedless of SchÃ¶nforst and the
rest, he rose from the table, walked into his tent, and threw himself
on the pallet which was his couch, to re-peruse the letter of his
betrothed.

The following was the passage at the end of her letter which caused
him so much thought and bewilderment:

'Oh, Carl!  Carl! what is separation but a living death--a blank in
life--a place vacant?'  ('How prone the girl is to speak of death!'
thought Charlie.)  'But I am ever and always with you in spirit, my
love.  Do you ever dream of me, Carl?  I ask this because last night
I had such a delicious dream of _you_.'

'_Last_ night,' thought Charlie, glancing again at the date of her
letter--'7th' August; 'last night must have been the 6th, when we
bivouacked in the stackyard, and I had such a vivid dream of her.'

'I imagined, love, Carl,' continued the letter, 'that I came upon you
suddenly, when you were lying on the cold earth in your cloak, as I
fear you too often are compelled to do.  A great horror seized me!  I
thought you were dead, you looked so white and wasted; but a sudden
joy came into my poor heart when I found you were but asleep.  I drew
your dear head upon my bosom, as a mother might do her baby's, and
caressed you, calling you "My darling!"  "My very own darling!" so
distinctly that Herminia heard me speaking in my sleep.

'And then you kissed me, Carl, with such tender and passionate kisses
as you gave me on that dear day in the Hoch Munster, and called me
your little wife and your guardian angel.  I was then startled by the
great hall clock striking three in the morning, and awoke to weep on
finding that it was all a dream, but a dear, dear dream to me.'

These were the actions and words of Charlie's dream, and he
remembered that when he awoke the hour of _three_ was tolled in the
village spire!

'What can it mean?' he exclaimed, tossing his thick curly hair back
from his forehead, impatiently--a way he had; 'the mystery of dreams
is unfathomable; they are, indeed, "strange--passing strange!"  The
same dream, yet we are miles upon miles apart!  The same words spoken
and heard!--the same night!--the same hour and moment of time!'

Was there some magnetic influence at work?  Some spiritual affinity,
born of this great love, between these two?  It almost seemed so.

Charlie Pierrepont, a matter-of-fact young officer, knew as little of
the famous Dr. Emmerson's theories of polarity and odic force, as he
did of the Philosophy of the Infinite, or any other abstruse
speculation of the present day.

Though bewildered and perplexed, as we have said, it gave him a
thrill of strange delight to think how strong, and yet how tender,
must be the tie of love between him and Ernestine to produce a
spiritual intercourse like this; and lest they might be laughed at by
the heedless Heinrich, it was not until some days subsequent to the
arrival of her letter that he revealed its contents to her brother,
to whom, fortunately for the corroboration of the story, he had told
of his vivid dream on the morning it occurred, before the regiment
marched from the village.




CHAPTER XV.

WHAT THE 'EXTRA BLATT' TOLD.

A few days after the Thuringians and others advanced from the
Moselle, the quiet family in the old Schloss of Frankenburg assembled
as usual at breakfast.  The old butler had cut and aired the morning
papers--the _Staats Anzeiger_, the _Cologne Gazette_, the _Extra
Blatt_, and so forth, and laid them beside the Count.  The two young
ladies were there in most becoming morning toilets, and there, too,
was the Herr Baron GrÃ¼nthal.  The hour was an unusual one for his
Excellency to be at Frankenburg, but he had been dining there the
evening before; a storm had come on, and, to the infinite annoyance
of Ernestine, he had accepted the Count's invitation to remain all
night.

With the single exception of absurd family pride and the consequent
tyranny over Ernestine, the general tenor of the Count's household
presented a fair example of German domestic life.

'The serious character of a people,' says the translator of
Schiller's poem 'The Glocke,' 'who begin the common business of
everyday life with prayer, who attach importance as well to the
manner of performing an action as to the action itself, the custom of
travelling, either in their own or in foreign countries, in the
interval between the completion of their education and their
settlement in life, the domestic manners, where great attention is
paid to the minutiÃ¦ of domestic economy,' are all, he maintains,
peculiar to the German people.

As southerns, the family of Frankenburg were more gay and lively in
manner than Germans usually are, for being nearer the Rhine they had
been for generations insensibly under French influences; yet they
were all German, to the heart's core.

Ernestine was looking crushed and pale.  The self-conscious air that
a really beautiful girl usually possesses had nearly left her now;
while Herminia, happy in her love, and having but one anxiety--the
safety of Heinrich--looked bright and radiant as ever.

In a letter from Heinrich to her, Ernestine had been told the story
of the strangely coincident dreams; and to a romantic and
enthusiastic girl like her--one deeply imbued, too, with German
mysticism--the idea that she had thus communed and met, and might
again commune with and meet her lover in the spirit, was a source of
the purest joy.  Every night she laid her head on the pillow in the
hope that her soul might fly to him; but as yet no more such visions
had come.

And this brave-hearted and handsome young Englishman--Carl, her own
Carl--he was risking wounds and death, enduring toil and suffering
for the Kaiser, for Germany, and for _her_; for well she knew that
Charlie Pierrepont identified her image with the Fatherland.  Then
how cruel it was of the Countess to view him so, and to treat him as
she did; and again and again she asked in her heart--

'Is it a crime to love?'

But rank was the _joss_, the idol that was worshipped in Frankenburg.

However, she had Charlie's ring on her finger, and a curly lock of
his hair in a gold locket, reposing in the cleft of her white bosom,
all unknown to the Herr Baron, and to all, save Herminia, who could
now see the blue ribbon at which it hung encircling her slender neck;
and in her bosom, too, she had his last letter, a mere scrap, but
full of love and truth and great tenderness; and yet he wrote of pay
and poverty.  Ob, how hard it was when youth alone should be money,
beauty, wealth, and everything.

'Ernestine, meine liebe,' the Countess would say from time to time,
'attend to the Herr Baron--assist him with your own pretty hands.
Dear girl! she is always so bright when you are here, GrÃ¼nthal.  She
must be doubly happy to see you this morning, after only leaving you
last night.'

But poor Ernestine looked anything but happy or bright either, and
the Baron, though a lover, was middle-aged; hence his raptures did
not spoil his appetite, and he made genuine German breakfast,
demolishing steaks, potatoes, rolls, eggs, and coffee, in the most
unromantic way in the world.

His hair was turning iron-grey, and on his pericranium was a bald
spot the size of a Prussian dollar.  He limped a little in his
gait--there was no concealing that devilish gout--yet he looked
surprisingly young.  He was attired in an elegant morning-coat with
pale-coloured trousers, a scarlet flower as well as a red ribbon at
his button-hole.  His hair was brushed up into a stiff bristly
pyramid in front; but his face looked flabby now, and his coarse
moustache, like that of a walrus, overhung his mouth.

Though suspicious, as we have said elsewhere, concerning that visit
to the Dom Kirche, and the mistake about the colour of the marble of
Charlemagne's throne, he had not the slightest idea that he had a
rival so formidable as Charlie Pierrepont, or that he, Herr Baron
GrÃ¼nthal, Oberdirector of the Consistory Court, could have any rival
at all!

Yet there was one thing he could not help remarking--that of all the
many handsome presents he had sent Ernestine, from Berlin and
elsewhere, not one was ever to be seen on her slender wrists, her
fairy-like hand, or round her delicate throat.

This surely boded ill for him as a lover!  He found himself, however,
highly acceptable to her family, and the marriage once over, all that
was necessary would be sure to come after.  Whenever he was present
or expected, the Countess always seemed, somehow, unusually large and
rustling, and on this morning was especially so, in white lace over
back moirÃ©, with her high _toupÃ©e_--it was quite an evening costume
she had donned.

The meal was taken somewhat silently, for at times:

  'When great events were on the gale,
  And each hour brought a varying tale;'

and when newspaper correspondents were often fallacious and fallible,
the gazettes were unfolded with fear and trembling, and the arrival
of a telegram was quite sufficient to terrify the quiet household at
Frankenburg.

The Count and Baron, with spectacles on nose, had skimmed over the
papers, which contained nothing to alarm them in the way of friends'
names among the lists of killed and wounded in the action of the 14th
of August; but the Baron read aloud, with peculiar unction, some of
those barbarous reports and stories with which the French and German
papers then teemed of cruelties perpetrated on both sides.  No one
knew then whether they were false or true; but they served to fan and
inflame the hatred of the adverse parties to fever heat.

The Baron read that many of the dead Arabs and Turcos at Freshweiler
were found with fragments of human flesh--torn from the German
wounded--between their jaws; that a Saxon officer, who had been
struck by a bullet, and taken shelter in the house of a peasant,
where he fainted from loss of blood, had his eyes torn out by a woman
armed with a fork.  These and many other details of atrocities, which
actually found their way into the London papers, he read for the
edification of the ladies, while Ernestine and Herminia exchanged
glances of horror and commiseration, as much as to say how awful it
was to think that those they loved so dearly had to run the risk of
perils such as these!

Even the Countess forgot her Spitz pug, and a piece of mysterious
crochet, that seemed endless as the web of Penelope, while listening
to the news, and far away from her peaceful home her thoughts
followed her son, to where in the fields, the lanes, the valleys, and
pretty hamlets of Alsace and Lorraine, and in places then rendered
deserts, there lay in hundreds--yea, in thousands--the hopes of
families, the heads of homes, the source of many a broken heart!

Suddenly the Baron raised his voice, and a strange gleam passed over
his face.

'Der Teufel!' he exclaimed; 'here is the name of a friend of
yours--in the _Extra Blatt_?

'Of mine--who?' asked the Count.

'We regret to learn by a recent telegram from the seat of war that a
party of the 95th Thuringian Regiment met with a severe misfortune,
and lost two officers.  Herr Lieutenant Pierrepont fell, it is
believed, mortally wounded----'

The Baron paused and changed colour; the Countess grew pale, but with
a smile of grim satisfaction on her lips; the Count said:

'Poor fellow--poor fellow!'

A low cry escaped Ernestine, who fell forward with her face on the
table, and her arms stretched upon it at full length; but this
emotion failed to avert the attention of the Baron, whose eyes, now
dilated, were fixed on the newspaper.  He was very pale, and shook
his head slowly, as he said to the Count:

'Ach Gott--the worst is yet to come.  Compose yourself, my dear
friend.'

'Read--read--it is the name of my son--my Heinrich, that you see,'
said the Countess, in a breathless voice.

'It is, madam.  "Herr Lieutenant Pierrepont fell, it is believed,
mortally wounded----"'

'You read that already; what matters it to me?'

'"And the Herr Graf Von Frankenburg was taken prisoner, and _hanged
by the Francs Tireurs_!"  Oh, my friends,' added the Baron, 'I
beseech you to suspend your grief for a time; it may all be some
terrible mistake, to be cleared up in the end.'

'We seem fated to have startling tidings here!' groaned the poor old
Count, as his wife flung herself in a passion of tears upon his
breast.




CHAPTER XVI.

IN FRONT OF METZ.

And now to relate that catastrophe which caused such grief and horror
to the hearts of all in that hitherto peaceful German home.

We have said that on the 13th of August the Prussian advanced guard
was at Pont-Ã -Mousson.  The following day saw them defiling, with
drums beating, colours flying, and bayonets flashing in the sun,
across the great bridge which there spans the Moselle, and gives its
name to the town.  This was on a Sunday morning, after the Herr
Pastor of the 95th had preached on the text of 'Peace on earth and
goodwill to all men'--French excepted, apparently--as the Colonel,
while the regiment was yet in a hollow square, issued special orders
as to the cleaning of the needle-guns and mode of carrying the
ammunition in the pouches.

General Steinmetz having orders to make a demonstration against the
French troops lying between him and the great fortress of Metz, at
two o'clock on the afternoon of Sunday ordered his seventh corps,
including the Thuringians and Westphalians, under General Von
Zastrow, to proceed to the attack.

As if inspired by one of those presentiments of coming evil that come
unbidden to many, and at times to the bravest of soldiers, on this
day Charlie Pierrepont was unusually taciturn, thoughtful, and sunk
in reverie.  'Rouse yourself, Carl, rouse!' Heinrich said to him,
cheerfully; 'you have had a little romance that is not yet ended.
The enemy is before us, and war brings promotion and glory.'

'To some.'

'And to others, Carl?'

'Death, perhaps.'

'Why so gloomy in an hour like this?' asked his friend.

'Life, Heinrich, is, alas! so full of the unforeseen!'

'Of course; but life has pleasant things in store for you yet.  You
have been having some gloomy dream of our Ernestine again.'

'I have not,' replied Charlie, with a sad smile.

'All will yet be well and happy for you both.  _My_ sister does not
require to look for wealth or position.  These she had already, and
the Baron of GrÃ¼nthal is lower in rank than a Grafine of the family
of Frankenburg,' he added so proudly, that there was much in his tone
and bearing which reminded Charlie of the Countess, his mother.

'This brigade will deploy into line, and throw forward skirmishers
from the flank of each regiment,' were now the orders of General Von
Zastrow; 'the other brigades will deploy in succession.'

And, on the spur, his aides-de-camp went skurrying hither and thither
to the commanders of battalions to have the requisite formation
completed with as little delay as possible.

'Take courage, Carl,' said Heinrich; 'my dear sister shall yet be
your wife--or the wife of no one else.'

'You forget that, save my pay, I am all but penniless.  A terrible
crime in the eyes of the Grafine Adelaide.'

'Penniless girls are often married for their beauty,' said young
Frankenburg, laughing; 'why should not a penniless man be married for
his talents or bravery?'

And, as the subdivisions were somewhat apart, those two brothers in
heart shook hands, saluted each other with their swords, and took
their places in the new _alignement_.

The day was a bright and beautiful one.  Over all Lorraine the green
woods and vineyards seemed to be sleeping in the glowing summer
sunshine, and the scared peasant near Courcelles Chaussy paused in
his work with the sweat on his brow, and spoke with bated breath, as
the marching troops went past to death and slaughter, and his honest
sunburnt face grew pale, perhaps at the thought of what might be.

Around Ars and Grigy, Borny and Colombey, and many other hamlets and
picturesque chateaux, the cattle, rich in colour and sleek in hide,
were chewing the cud among the knee-deep pastures; the fresh blue
streams ran on their course as if rejoicing to escape the scenes of
blood that were about to ensue; the blue kingfishers flitted about,
and the sparrows twittered in the green hedge-rows, the branches of
which were matted and intertwined with gorgeous wild flowers.  The
corn was waving in the ripening fields, the swallows skimmed in the
air, and from their cottage doors the buxom peasant girls, their
cheeks dusky with southern blood and their black eyes sparkling with
tears and terror, stood by their mother's side and watched in sorrow
and terror the forward march of the Prussian troops to conquest and
carnage, and the village bells, from more than one Gothic spire, rang
out the hour that was to be the death-knell of thousands closing in
the shock of steel.

The moment the formation of the infantry in line was complete, the
cavalry scouts went galloping to the front, and in a few minutes a
green ridge in front of the Prussian infantry was studded by Uhlans,
with their figures and tall lances clearly defined against the pure
blue of the sky.  Anon, these weapons were slung, and pistols were
resorted to, and a sharp cracking of these announced that the enemy
was in sight.

In a cloud of dust, a body of dragoons in close column of troops now
poured along the broad highway, with swords and helmets flashing in
the sun.  There were the escort of the artillery, which came rumbling
along, with rammers and sponges ready for use, the limber-boxes
unlocked, the gunners ready to leap down, and wheel their muzzles to
the enemy.

When deploying from close column into line, the companies marched
over everything, treading to mud and mire the golden grain--the hope
of the husbandman and farmer; while the horses of the cavalry ate it
standing in their ranks.

Resolutely marched on the Prussian infantry, each man with his blue
greatcoat rolled over his right shoulder, the deadly zundnadelgewehr
with bayonet fixed, sloped on his left shoulder, the chain of his
helmet down, lest it should fall off in the mÃªlÃ©e.  The Uhlans fell
back round the flanks, and then the French were seen lurking in
rifle-pits, which on one hand afforded them protection, and, on the
other, enabled them over the little earthen banks to take sure aim at
the invaders.

These rifle-pits and other defences extended over a considerable
space of ground, from Colombey, with its fields of scarlet poppies,
to Ars-sur-Moselle (so famous for its red wines), including
Laguenxey, Grigy, and Borny, all pretty little hamlets.  The firing
first began at the village of Ste. Barbe, within seven miles from the
walls of Metz, in front of which were the principal corps of the
French army under Marshal Bazaine, according to the Prussian account.

The fire from the chassepots was deadly, and in their eagerness to
come to close quarters, the Prussian officers were seen brandishing
their straight-cutting swords and heard crying--

'Vorwarts! vorwarts!  Hoch Germania!'

On the other hand the French were not slow in crying--

'En avant! en avant! Ã  bas la Prusse, et vive la France.'  For they
were ceasing to shout the Emperor's name now.

The whole of the villages had to be stormed by the Prussians in
succession.  The French resisted nobly; hence the slaughter was
terrible.  In one rifle-pit alone there lay seven hundred and
eighty-one corpses; the chateau of Colombey was taken and recaptured
three times at the point of the bayonet.

The livelong day the battle lasted over all the ground before Metz,
seven and a half miles in length.  The air was loaded with the smoke
of cannon and musketry, enveloping alike the dead and wounded, who
lay everywhere, in fields and gardens, under hedgerows and hayricks,
in vineyards and rifle-pits.

The Prussians were every moment receiving fresh reinforcements, and
the troops of Bazaine, unable to check their advance, fell slowly
back upon Metz, but fighting every foot of the way.

The 95th were at the third capture of the Chateau of Colombey, out of
which the French Voltigeurs were driven in a fair hand-to-hand
conflict, leaving behind them a vast number of wounded and slain.
Among the former, supporting himself against a fragment of the
shot-shattered wall, was a French captain bleeding profusely from a
wound in the breast.

The fÃ¤hnrich of Charlie's company, young Donnersberg, approached and
offered him his handkerchief to staunch the bleeding, when the
Frenchman, inspired by some sudden gust of national hate and rancour,
uttered 'a good garrison oath,' and with all the strength that yet
remained in his arm, ran his sword through the body of the German,
and killed him on the spot.

Both fell nearly at the same time, as two or three bayonets clashed
in the body of the Frenchman, who lay over a pile of dead, bleeding
from several wounds.  A few minutes after, Charlie chanced to pass
where he still lay in the courtyard of the chateau, to all appearance
dead.  On his breast was the handsome white enamelled Grand Cross of
the Legion of Honour, conspicuous among his Crimean medals.

'A present for my Ernestine!' thought he; 'and it is no use now to
this treacherous fellow.'

'Not yet, not yet,' muttered the Frenchman, while his white lips
quivered and his blood-shot glazing eyes turned slowly on Charlie;
'accursed Prussian, I am not yet done with it.'

Charlie drew back.  He would have taken it from the dead man without
compunction, but shrank from touching the living.

'A little time--a little time,' moaned the Frenchman, 'and I shall
indeed be done with it, and all--earthly things.'

'Pardon me,' said Charlie, and was about to pass on, when the
Frenchman spoke again.

'Water,' said he, in a low piteous voice, like a sigh; 'one drop of
water on my lips, for the love of God!'

Charlie glanced for a moment at the body of young Donnersberg that
lay close by, with the Voltigeur's sword nearly up to the hilt in his
breast; and then, inspired by pity, placed his water-bottle to the
lips of his slayer, whose face was ghastly now and covered with the
dew of death.

'_Merci!  Merci!_  I am dying!' said he.  'Take my cross, or less
worthy hands will soon do so,' he added, trying with a feeble and
fatuous hand to detach the ornament from his breast; 'but what will
you do with it?'

'Hang it round the neck of her I love,' replied Charlie, who spoke
French fluently, and hoping its destination might please a
Frenchman's love of gallantry.

'Take it, then.  Take it,' replied the latter, as he rent the cross
from his breast by a last effort; 'take it, accursed Prussian!' he
hissed, through his clenched teeth, 'and when you hang it round the
neck of her you love, may she be like--like me!'

'What mean you?'

'_A corpse!_'

With this dreadful and inhuman wish, the vindictive Gaul sank back; a
deadlier pallor overspread his features--there was a terrible sound
in his throat, and all was over.  For a moment Charlie stood
bewildered, with the cross in his hand, and half-tempted to cast it
from him.  But he changed his mind, and carefully placed it in his
breast-pocket as a _souvenir_ for Ernestine of the battles before
Metz, and hurried to join the shattered remnant of his regiment, now
hurrying with others, double-quick, to take part in the attack of the
orchards of the farm of Bellecroix, where two batteries of
mitrailleuses made dreadful havoc among the assailants, sweeping
whole ranks away.

By the time the batteries were taken, the French, after losing
_nineteen_ thousand men (and the Prussians fully an equal number),
were in rapid retreat for Metz.  Charlie Pierrepont's work was over
for the day, and like his friend Heinrich, he still found himself
untouched.

The sun was setting, and the shadows were darkening in the orchards
of Bellecroix, when the 95th were ordered to pile arms and take a
little rest; and a singular scene--singular by way of contrast, and
yet terrible--did these orchards present.  The trees were still in
full foliage and bearing, and thickly among the green leaves the
apples, golden and red, the yellow pears, the downy peaches, and the
purple plums were all mingling on the branches above; below lay the
dead and the dying, some of whom in their agony had burrowed their
faces into the very earth; others had torn it up in handfuls.  A few,
who had been wounded early in the day, lay dead now, with their hairy
knapsacks under their heads, and many with sweet smiles on their
waxen faces, as if their last thoughts had been of home, and those
who loved them there.

Some had died with their fingers clasped in prayer, others with their
hands clenched, as if in rage or pain, and with their faces terribly
contorted.  Everywhere lay knapsacks, shakos, kepis, helmets, arms,
and water-bottles.  Pierrepont gladly quitted these dreadful orchards
of Bellecroix, and retired to a grassy bank by the side of the
highway to Metz, where a few of his brother officers, apart from the
rest, were sharing the contents of their havresacks and comparing
notes on the dire events of the day.

There he found young Frankenburg mounted on the horse of the
adjutant, who had fallen in the attack on Bellecroix, and whose duty
he had been ordered to take in the interim, an office that was nearly
costing him very dear soon after.

As the troops were to halt on the field pending those operations
which led to the battle of Gravelotte, a chain of out-pickets was
detailed for the night, and Charlie Pierrepont, as many of his
seniors had been killed off or wounded in that day's strife, had
command of one of these, consisting of two non-commissioned officers
and thirty men, with whom he was ordered to take possession of a
little chateau nearer Metz than Bellecroix, to use it as his
picket-house, and post his sentinels as to him seemed best.

He accordingly marched for this place, the Chateau de CaillÃ©,
belonging to a French gentleman of that name.  It was a
quaint-looking little place, with latticed windows of iron, two or
three little stone _tourelles_, with conical roofs and vanes, and it
was quite buried among masses of ivy, jasmine, and clematis, and
embosomed, among rich fruit-trees.

Having posted ten sentinels, equidistant and in communication with
those of the adjacent pickets, with orders to stand on their posts
and keep their faces steadily turned in the direction of Metz, the
dark mass of the citadel which, together with the spires of the
churches, could be traced against the now moonlit sky, he approached
the chateau with the main body of his picket, never doubting that
they would find it deserted, and that the family of M. de CaillÃ© had
fled.

Passing down the little avenue which led to the front door, brilliant
lights were visible in the lower rooms; loud and noisy voices were
heard.  Charlie ordered his men to look to their cartridges.  As for
the bayonets, they were never unfixed now; but a loud, hoarse German
chorus that rang out upon the night showed that the place was already
in possession of friends, and on entering the dining-room of the
chateau, a curious scene presented itself.

It was a handsome apartment, with an elaborately polished floor, and
modern furniture in the fashion of the time of Louis XIV.  Wax
candles in great profusion were burning on the elaborately inlaid
table, on which were spread in great confusion dishes, plates,
glasses, and bottles with viands and fruit of every kind.  M. de
CaillÃ©, as he proved to be, a fine-looking old French gentleman, with
hair and moustache white as the thistle-down, was there tied hand and
foot with a rope, the end of which was secured to the knob of a
shutter, compelling him to look helplessly on at the desolation of
his dwelling, into which a dozen or so of stragglers from some
Bavarian regiment, as they appeared to be, as their helmets were
crested with black bearskin and not spikes, had broken, and were now
making merry, eating, drinking, singing, and roughly pulling about
Mademoiselle de CaillÃ©, her terrified _bonne_, and other female
servants; and it was only too evident that but for the timely arrival
of Charlie and his picket, something very disastrous must have
ensued, as these fellows were fast maddening themselves by drinking
all kinds of wines and spirits in succession.

On Charlie's entrance, sword in hand, such is the influence of the
epaulette, that they all started to their feet; their noise died away
instantly, and every man raised his right hand to the peak of his
helmet.  Believing they were utterly lost now on the appearance of
this fresh arrival, the young lady uttered a cry of despair, and
shrank to the side of her father, who was unable to put forth even a
hand to shield her, and who eyed Charlie Pierrepont with a
half-piteous, half-defiant expression.

He was considerably reassured, however, when he heard the latter
announce the duty which brought him there, and ordered the Bavarians,
on pain of being treated as mutineers or deserters, at once to return
to their quarters.  They hurried to obey with more alacrity than
goodwill, one alone venturing to explain that they had been fighting
all day without food or drink, and were in an enemy's country.  By a
wave of his sword, Charlie cut him short, and ere he had shot it into
the sheath, the chateau was empty of all but his own men, who crowded
into the kitchen, and there certainly made free with all that the
cook's pantry contained.

Charlie now apologized to M. de CaillÃ© for the conduct of the
Bavarians, and hastened to cut the cord that bound him.  He was so
weak and faint from all he had undergone, that he could only stagger
into an arm-chair, when his daughter caressed him and chafed his
hands, and while the _bonne_ poured out some wine for him and
Charlie, to whom she curtseyed, and tendered her thanks again and
again.

After a time all became more composed, and the conversation naturally
ran on the events of the day, and the dreadful din of cannon and
musketry which had been ringing for miles around the little chateau;
and somehow, while chatting over their wine, and Charlie received
again and again the heartfelt thanks of the old Frenchman, the
latter, by some word or exclamation that escaped him, discovered the
nationality of the former.

'Thank God, monsieur is an Englishman!' he exclaimed.

'Yes,' said Charlie, with one of his pleasant smiles.

'And yet you fight for those horrible barbarians, the Prussians?'
exclaimed the young lady.

'I am a soldier of fortune, my dear child,' said Charlie, laughing,
for the girl was only in her fifteenth year, apparently, and he could
not but remember that Ernestine was one of those 'horrible
barbarians.'

'I could have guessed as much,' said the girl.

'How, Mademoiselle?

'By a certain boldness in your bearing, and by something in your eyes
that tells of----' she paused shyly and coloured at her own
impetuosity.

'An expression that tells of what?' asked Charlie.

'I don't know, unless it is of--sorrow.'

'You are an acute observer, Mademoiselle,' said Charlie, bowing.  'I
have indeed undergone much sorrow but lately.'

The girl had a pretty, innocent, and most lovable little face.  She
was, probably, half German in blood; her eyes were bright blue; her
cheeks delicate and peach-like; her lips a ruddy red, though cheek
and lips were ashy white with terror when Charlie first saw her,
being pulled about roughly by the Bavarians, who had boisterously
dragged her from one another, under the eyes of her helpless and
agonized father.

She nestled up to Charlie's side, and shaking the masses of her rich
brown hair--hair that in its tint reminded him of Herminia--she put a
pretty hand on each of his epaulettes, and looking into his face with
pure childish confidence, said--

'I shall like you.  I am sure I shall.  I am so happy you are not one
of those barbarians, though you do wear a spike-helmet!'

'Why?  How should you like me?'

'Can you ask me _why_, Monsieur, after saving our lives?  In
gratitude, I can love you and pray for you.'

Charlie laughed, and said--

'_Ma belle_, I am, indeed, thankful that we were in time to turn
these marauders out of doors.'

And then he thought of his three sisters at home, and what his
emotions would be if such a scene, as he had just interrupted, had
taken place in his father's quiet house in Warwickshire.

'What is your name, Monsieur?' she asked, 'as I must never forget it.'

'Carl--Charles Pierrepont.'

She repeated it two or three times, and laughing, said:

'It sounds very droll!'

Charlie could not help laughing at the girl's _naÃ¯ve_ manner, and
thought that the old Warwickshire squire, who was fond of deducing
his descent from Robert, who received the manor of Hurstpierpoint, in
Sussex, from the Conqueror, would have found nothing 'droll' in it.

'And what is yours, Mademoiselle?'

'CÃ©landine--CÃ©landine de CaillÃ©.'

'Well, I cannot say it is _droll_.  I think it very pretty.'

'Your little rebuke is a just one, Monsieur,' said the smiling old
gentleman, who, had Charlie been a genuine Prussian, would little
have relished all this conversation between him and his daughter.

'We shall be very good friends, I doubt not, for to-night, at least,
Monsieur.'

'Only for to-night?'

'To-morrow shall relieve you of our hateful presence, as we shall
probably move against Metz.'

'Don't say "hateful," Monsieur, when we owe you so much, and esteem
you so much,' urged CÃ©landine.

'Ernestine will never have a rival, even here,' thought Charlie, as
he begged them to excuse him, as he had to go his rounds, and, with
his sergeant, post fresh sentinels.

That duty done, he undid his belt, but without undressing, threw
himself on a sofa, and, utterly exhausted and worn out by the whole
events of the day, oblivious of the presence of Mademoiselle de
CaillÃ© and her father in the dining-room, he slept as soundly as
Hood's old woman,

  'Who might have worn a percussion cap,
  And been knocked on the head without hearing it snap.'




CHAPTER XVII.

FACING A BATTERY OF MITRAILLEUSES.

The night passed over quietly, and without alarm; but with dawn of
day came an officer of Uhlans, attended by a trumpeter, flying at
full speed along the line of advanced posts, calling in all the
out-pickets, while the King was probably already telegraphing to
Berlin as usual:--

'Another new victory!  Thank God for His mercy!'

Referring to the official pietism of the Prussian monarch at this
crisis, a very impartial historian of the war says thus:--'How little
his armies were controlled by regard for humanity--the most essential
element of any religion--will appear in lurid colours.  Abu Bekr, the
successor of Mohammed, enjoined his soldiers not to kill old people,
women, or children; to cut down no palm-trees, nor burn any fields of
corn; to spare all fruit-trees; and slay no cattle but such as they
could take for their own use.  But the Prussians made a desert of
France, burned villages and small towns, and treated old people and
women with horrible barbarity.  But they were prodigal of religious
words, and words with many have too often a greater weight than
facts.'

But with all this, it should be borne in mind, from past experience
of French invading armies, how would those of the Emperor have
behaved had they reached Berlin?

One of a thousand of such episodes, as were daily occurring along the
frontiers of Alsace and Lorraine, would no doubt have desolated for
ever the household of M. de CaillÃ© but for the timely arrival of
Pierrepont and his twenty Thuringians.

Aware of this, when the Uhlan trumpet sounded, CÃ©landine de CaillÃ©,
like most young girls, a light sleeper, heard it before the war-worn
Charlie, and pale and startled, came forth in the prettiest of
morning robes to bid him farewell, and to stuff his havresack, and
the havresacks of his men (though they were Prussians), with all that
the Bavarians had not consumed last night.

Charlie thought how fresh and radiant the young girl looked in her
white morning dress, with blue breastknots, and a ribbon of the same
colour in her hair, a soft light shining in her blue eyes, and a
little colour in her peach-like cheek, that reminded him of
Ernestine; but, ah! who was like Ernestine?

A soldier fresh from one battle and going forth to fight another is
an object of interest to all; but a handsome, frank, and free-hearted
young fellow, like Charlie Pierrepont, was doubly so to an
impassionable girl like Mademoiselle de CaillÃ©; thus her blue eyes
filled with tears as he kissed her tremulous little hand, which, like
her taper arm, came so delicately forth from the wide-laced sleeves
of her dress.

'Why are there tears in your eyes, Mademoiselle?' asked Charlie, with
a kind smile.

'Because, Monsieur, I pity you.'

'Pity me!'

'Indeed I do, Monsieur.  Most earnestly.'

'And why?'

'Because you are too young, and too good and kind, to be killed.
Oh!' continued the girl, looking up in his face, 'I implore you to go
home--home to your own England--home to your mother, if you have one,
and leave these odious Prussians to fight their own battles.'

'It is too late, my pretty friend.'

'How so?'

'The die is cast that makes me--Prussian.'

'Will another horrible battle be fought to-day?' asked Monsieur de
CaillÃ©, who now made his appearance.

'I am sure of it, Monsieur,' replied Charlie.

'_Mon Dieu!  Mon Dieu!_' exclaimed CÃ©landine, clasping her hands, and
looking upwards; 'and you will be in it?'

'Undoubtedly, Mademoiselle.'

She drew very close to Charlie, and said, in a low voice,

'Pardon me, _mon ami_--but--but when were you last at mass or
confession?'

'We don't attend to either much in the 95th,' was Charlie's evasive
reply; 'besides, our Herr Pastor is a Lutheran.'

The sweet French girl eyed him wistfully.

'You are too good and humane thus to die like a heathen!' said she,
'and many more will die to-day.  Promise me, Monsieur, that you will
wear this.'

And from her white neck she took a little holy cross and medal,
suspended by a blue ribbon, which she passed over Charlie's head.

'For your sake, then,' said Charlie gallantly.

'For your own, rather.  Whether you believe in such things or not, it
will do you no harm to wear it.'

'_TrÃ¨s bon_, my child!' said the old gentleman; 'but Monsieur has a
cross already,' he added, patting the iron one at the breast of
Charlie's blue tunic.

'And now I must go,' said he, putting on his helmet; 'there sounds
the trumpet again.'

As he bade them adieu and left them, the French girl, with a quick
pretty action, flicked some holy water in his face from a Dresden
china font that hung inside the door of the dining-room, and the
glittering drops fell on his moustache and silver gorget, which the
Prussians still wear, or at least wore then; and father and daughter
stood sadly in the porch, looking after their protector as he marched
off at the head of his men, for Charlie, though a thorough English
gentleman, was, as some say, 'the soldier all over, but the soldier
adventurer--the soldier of fortune, rather than the soldier of
routine.'

Charlie, we fear, and are ashamed to admit it, did not pray often.
'It wasn't much in his line; besides, what was the Herr Pastor paid
for?' but as he marched back to headquarters on the Bellecroix road,
at the head of his picket, he prayed in his heart that no harm--no
perils, such as those of last night--might ever again menace that
frank, engaging, and innocent young girl at the Chateau de CaillÃ©.

But he had not seen the last of that old mansion.

By this time, a considerable portion of the German army had
penetrated so far to the west and north-west of Metz, as to be almost
already between Marshal Bazaine and Paris!  The line of the invading
forces was thus so greatly extended that the French generalissimo
dared not make any offensive movement against them, but was compelled
to retreat along the highways that led from Gravelotte to Verdun.

Charlie had barely rejoined his regiment, and exchanged a few words
with Heinrich, SchÃ¶nforst, and other friends, when the order came for
the line to advance, as the French were in position at Vionville,
covering the whole southern road to Verdun, with a front extending to
the village of Gorz, eight miles south-west of Metz; and in their
martial ardour to meet the enemy, many of the Thuringians, as the
march forward began, struck up the fine war-song of Arndt.

In the ranks of this regiment, as in others of the Prussian army,
were many well-born and gently nurtured young men, bred to
professions or businesses, and who could speak several languages, and
take their place in good society, but were dragged away from their
avocation, hearth, and home, by the Prussian military system.  There
were others, again, grey, brown, and hardy men, who could digest
sutler's beef and eat such ammunition bread as the Kaiser's
commissariat supplied, sleep in their spike-helmets as soundly as in
a velvet night-cap, feel, by a bivouac fire, as comfortable as if in
the Grand Hotel at Cologne, and march to be maimed or massacred, to
wound and to slay, with genuine Teutonic taciturnity and phlegm.


The battle of the day began on some wooded hills above the pretty
red-tiled village of Gorz, near a pleasant stream that meanders
between fields and beautiful coppices from Mars-la-Tour to the
Moselle.

By sheer force of numbers, the Prussians, while giving and receiving
a storm of musketry, pushed into the woods, driving the French
skirmishers before them.  Those who were spectators saw the little
scarlet kepis of the latter dispersing in succession amid the white
smoke and green foliage; then the dark-coated Prussians, with their
spike-helmets and goat-skin packs, disappeared also in pursuit.  What
happened in this part of the battle no one knows, or ever will know,
as it was entirely in the dense woods and deep valleys, and thus no
general view could be obtained; yet it is to this part of the field
we have to refer, for there fought the 95th regiment.

From one wooded slope to another the French fell back, fighting
desperately.  In the valleys, the din of war rang with a hundred
reverberations.  Shrieks, cries, and hoarse cheering shook the very
woodlands, and the smoke curled up from the latter as if they were on
fire.  White puffs and red flashes seemed to burst from every bush
and tree.  Now and then the bayonets flashed, or a tricolour appeared
amid the foliage; but on, almost without check, went the Prussians,
over ground strewn with the terrible _debris_ of men, gun-carriages,
limbers, and horses, in many instances blown literally to pieces, for
the whole ground was ploughed by shot and shell, and sown with rifle
bullets.

Charlie's regiment, with the 40th, 67th, and 69th, was ordered to
surround and storm a cottage mid-way on the Gorze road.  The reason
of four battalions being sent to storm a mere cottage was that it was
held by a half-battery of French mitrailleuses, which did frightful
execution in their ranks as they advanced.

Forward they went at a rush, the living tumbling over the
fast-falling dead, these dreadful cannon belching death and
destruction from amid the foliage in front, with that horrible
shrieking sound peculiar to their discharge, and Charlie felt the
_streams_ of shot as they passed him.

A wild cry of agony, amid many others, made him look to his right.
There lay SchÃ¶nforst and half his company writhing or dead in one
bloody heap; and the next moment it was Charlie's turn.

He felt as if a hot sword-blade had entered his breast--there was a
heavy blow, a sharp tearing of the body, an emotion of rage or
anger--a loud cry escaped him, and he fell on his face, enduring
terrible agony.  He staggered up, just as the attacking force swept
over him to assault the battery, but fell over on his side, and lay
with the blood pouring from his chest.

Wounded at last--perhaps mortally! was his first reflection; for he
could feel that the bullet was in his body still.  Life, death--the
past, the future--'the possible heaven, the impending hell'--all
flashed upon him, with thoughts of his own misery in lying there
dying, helpless, and so far from Ernestine!

A faintness came over him, from which he was roused by feeling some
one opening his tunic.

'Where are you wounded?' asked a familiar voice, and Charlie found
the doctor of the regiment--with all of whom, we have said, he was a
great favourite--bending over him kindly, with the hospital attendant
of his company.

'In the breast,' he gasped.

The doctor had but little time to lose, and the bullets were
_pinging_ past him and his patient in every direction.

'The bullet is lodged near the spine,' said the doctor, 'and it must
be cut out, but not here.'

'Is--is the wound dangerous?' he faltered.

'Not very; but great care will be requisite.'

Whether on the part of himself or his medical attendant Charlie did
not inquire; the tone in Which the doctor said 'very' lessened his
hopes.

'God's will be done,' said he; and there flashed on his memory all
that little CÃ©landine de CaillÃ© had said to him that morning about
religion; while the doctor put a pad on the wound, bandaged it, and
hastened to look at SchÃ¶nforst, but he was long since past all aid,
and stone-dead.

Save the moans, cries, and interjections--pious, fierce, or
despairing--of those around him, Charlie heard little more but the
occasional boom of the heavy guns as the tide and din of the battle
rolled away towards Gravelotte; and great faintness, like a kind of
sleep, stole over him.  From time to time the acute agony of his
wound roused him, and amid his terrible thoughts, ever present were
the images of Ernestine and his family.

The emotion of faintness increased as the day wore on and evening
came.  He saw many around him die, and thinking that his own time
would soon come too, he thought once more of the French girl's words,
and strove to fashion a prayer or two, but they were little else than
pious invocations.

Dying, as he certainly deemed himself to be, his thoughts flashed
incessantly to her he loved; her whose soft hand might too probably
never be in his again; anon to his boyhood's home in Warwickshire;
the voices of his father and of his dead mother came drowsily to his
ear; the soft English faces of his sisters floated before him.  Oh,
how hard it was to lie there bleeding, and too probably dying, when
they were all making merry, perhaps, in that drawing-room which he
remembered so well, and many of the pettiest details of which, even
to a crack in the ceiling, came strangely back to memory now, with
scraps of songs and forgotten airs.

Would the Krankentrager never come to take him away?  Had the doctor
and hospital attendant both forgotten him, or had been killed?  The
latter, too probably.

So the long, long day of anxiety, thirst, and agony passed away, and
sunset came on.  Charlie watched it fading on the distant woods and
green slopes of those lovely Lorraine valleys, till the mellowing
haze of twilight blurred all the landscape into gloom, and the
silvery moon and the evening star came forth in their beauty to light
up the carnage of the past day.

Neither the doctor nor the hospital attendant of his company had
forgotten poor Charlie; but strange to say, when they came to look
for him with a party about midnight, no trace could be found of him
save a pool of blood on the grass where he had lain.

So the Countess, perhaps, had her wicked wish fulfilled at last, and
fate had removed 'the intruder,' as she named him, for ever from the
path of Baron GrÃ¼nthal!




CHAPTER XVIII.

IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS.

We must now devote a short chapter to the fate of young Frankenburg.

Ignorant that his friend Pierrepont had fallen--and a knowledge
thereof would have served the latter but little--Heinrich, in his
present capacity of adjutant, had to keep at his post and go on with
the regiment, which, like the others, carried all before it.

The French, aware of the vital importance of keeping possession of a
hill on their right, as soon as their troops began to fall back
before those battalions sent forward by General Steinmetz, threw up
some earthen works, in rear of which their 62nd regiment of the line
lay down, while several batteries of artillery fired over their
heads, raining grape and shell upon the fast-advancing Prussians.

For three hours the fighting was desperate there--the slaughter on
both sides woeful!  Again the French fell back, and the Prussians
brought up battery after battery of Krupp guns to the summit of the
abandoned height, the gunners using their whips and spurs, the
officers brandishing their swords and shouting, 'Vorwarts! vorwarts!'
with their horses at a gallop.

In the ardour of the pursuit, or in terror of the dreadful sounds
which shook the air, the horse ridden by Heinrich, having got the bit
of the bridle firmly wedged between his teeth for a time, darted with
his rider to the front at racing speed, and fairly carried him
through the line of the retreating French!

Shot after shot was fired after him, but he escaped them all, and ere
long found himself in a village, the main street of which was crowded
by Francs-Tireurs, who seemed to have expended all their ammunition,
as they pursued him simply with fixed bayonets, yells, and ferocious
maledictions; for, as the Prussians gave no quarter to this species
of volunteer force, they were not disposed to give any in return, so
Heinrich began to give himself up for lost.

An alley opened on his right, and by it he hoped to gain the open
country.  He spurred his horse and shouted; he urged it with leg and
hand and voice, and forced it to the right down the alley, followed
by a shout of fierce derisive laughter, the source of which he soon
discovered to be the fact that the alley had no outlet, and that he
was fairly entrapped in a narrow _cul-de-sac_!

To take a pistol from the holsters, to leap from his horse, make a
dash into the nearest house, was to Heinrich but the work of an
instant; but he had barely closed and secured the door, ere the human
tide of the Francs-Tireurs, intent on revenge and bloodshed, came
surging wildly down the alley against it.

The house had been abandoned by its owners.  He sought for the
back-door, but there was none.  He could only drop from an upper
window into a garden; but his uniform would cause him at once to be
recognised, and instant death was sure to follow.  Not a moment was
to be lost!  He looked wildly round him.  On a peg there hung a
loose, coarse peasant blouse of blue cloth.  He tore off his uniform,
threw it and his helmet aside with his weapons, donned the blouse,
and was just in the act of dropping from the window, when his
exulting pursuers, who had soon forced the door, burst into the room,
with cries of:

'TuÃ©, tuÃ©!--justice, revenge!--revenge for the Francs-Tireurs!'

The garden-wall was uncommonly high, the gate securely locked; outlet
there was none; and in another minute Frankenburg found himself in
the hands of a score of these French volunteers, so many of whose
comrades had been--no doubt, barbarously--put to death by the
Prussians, simply for being found with arms in their hands, so that
to look for mercy was vain.  Their grasp was upon him; and in their
desire to destroy him, they actually impeded each other, and for a
second or two it seemed doubtful whether he was to perish by the
charged bayonet or the whirled butt-end of the chassepot, as he was
hustled and dragged hither and thither from hand to hand.

'Checkmated--cornered!' thought he, as the faces of Herminia and all
at home came before him; 'to die thus--and at the hands of these
rascally French peasantry.'  Suddenly one exclaimed:

'Un espion--un mouchard!  A Prussian disguised in a blouse--he was
about to become a spy!'

'L'espion, l'espion!--a rope, a rope!' cried the rest, catching at
the new idea with extreme fervour.  'No, no--bayonet him!' cried one.

'They hanged my brother at Borny,' said another;' so, by Baalzebub,
let us hang him--hang him, Etienne!'

Heinrich's blood ran cold at this horrible suggestion.

'I did but seek to escape, messieurs, in exchanging my uniform for
this dress,' said he.

'Oh, of course--of course!' they cried, with fierce mockery and
cruelty flashing in their eyes.

'I did it but to save my life,' he urged.  'Diable--of course!'

'I am but one man among hundreds,' he continued.

'And so shall die--tuÃ©! tuÃ©!' cried they altogether.

'You are a band of cowards!' exclaimed Heinrich, defiantly; 'I do not
fear to die.  Hurrah for Germany!'

'Hah, ha!  hah, ha!--Ã  bas le Prussien!' they chorused.

One now appeared with a rope, which he had procured somewhere, and a
cold perspiration burst over the brows of Heinrich.

'I am the Graf Von Frankenburg,' he urged, almost, but not quite,
piteously.  'I am an officer of the Thuringians--let me die the death
of a soldier, not that of a felon.'

'You are the Graf Von Frankenburg?' said one; 'be it so.  The higher
the rank the greater the disgrace in dying the death of a spy; so,
coquin, hang you shall.'

Resistance was vain; the iron grasp of many was on each of his arms,
and he was as helpless in their hands as an infant.  His father, his
mother, his love--the bright-haired Herminia!--what horror would the
story of his fate cost them!  It was too dreadful to think of; it was
madness!

'Oh,' thought he, 'that I had but died on yonder field, and not
thus--not _thus_--in the hands of wretches such as these!'

He disdained to ask for mercy, and resolved to die with dignity even
the horrid death to which they had doomed him.  But little time was
given him for reflection, and none for prayer; yet a cry certainly
escaped him, and a nervous shudder, when he found a corporal actually
adjusting the hastily constructed halter about his neck.  An
involuntary effort he made for resistance or escape, and then stood
still and passive.

'Throw the end of the rope over that apple-tree,' was the command of
the corporal; and after one or two efforts it was thrown over a
suitable branch, 'Stand aside, comrades,' was the next command; 'whip
him up now, and make fast the rope to the branch below.'

While a mocking shout burst from the band, and many brutal and
irreligious speeches were made, some crying piteously, 'Bon voyage,
Monsieur le Comte--bon voyage, mon Prussien,' the noose closed and
tightened round the neck of Heinrich.  His eyeballs seemed to start
from their sockets, dark purple overspread his face, and he was swung
up to the branch, where he dangled in convulsive agony, swinging and
swaying to and fro, with a hoarse, rattling, gulping sound in his
throat, and with his feet about eight feet from the ground.

The other end of the fatal rope was made fast to a lower branch, and
then the Francs-Tireurs rushed away, with mocking shouts, to join
their comrades, and left the unhappy Heinrich--the 'Prussian spy,' as
they falsely affected to call him--to his miserable fate.




CHAPTER XIX.

THE CHATEAU DE CAILLE.

And now to account for the mysterious disappearance of Charlie
Pierrepont, which the Herr Doctor could only account for by supposing
that in the restlessness of his agony, or desire to procure water, he
had crawled away into some obscure corner to die.  But such was not
the case.

It was still dusky night, or lighted only by the moon, when Charlie,
lying where we left him, began to surmise whether the morning sun
would evermore gladden his eyes, that were staring upward at the
stars, as they twinkled through the branches of those trees amid
which the battle had been partly fought, and the stems of which, in
places, were barked and whitened by the passing whirlwinds of shot
from the mitrailleuses.

'If I die,' thought he, 'the label at my neck will tell the burial
party who I am--or was.'

And as the slow hours of the night stole on, he thought of the
ghastly face of the French captain who killed the young ensign
Donnersberg, and the peculiar hatred and inhumanity expressed by his
dying wish.  The sound of wheels coming slowly along now roused him.
A party of the Krankentrager, picking up the wounded, were passing
near.  He tried to call aloud, but his voice had failed him.

'How high the moon is to-night,' said one.

'How bright, you mean; for I don't suppose she is higher up than
usual,' replied another.

'But it would be a lovely night for having another turn with the
French schelms, in their long blue coats and red kepis.'

'There has been slaughter enough, for one day, Rudiger; ugh!--how
thick the corpses lie here, where the horrible mitrailleuses have
been playing.'

The waggon was stopped, and the soldiers looked about them.

Suddenly one said--

'There is young Herr Pierrepont, the Englander of the 95th.  How in
his heart he loved the crack of the zundnadelgewehr, or the click of
steel on steel!  So he is gone, too!'

'He is worth a dozen dead men yet!' exclaimed one of the
Krankentrager, leaping off the seat of the ambulance waggon, on
seeing Charlie's eyes and hand move.

Some brandy-and-water was given him as a reviver, and he was lifted
into the waggon, which was already full, and was hence driven from
the field; and here we may mention that the Krankentrager is one of
the best-organized corps in the Prussian army, and its special duty
is to carry the sick and wounded.

In this Franco-Prussian war, it is to be recorded that to their
immortal honour, the Sisters of Mercy were always on every field of
battle _before the firing ceased_, and they went on foot, each little
company preceded by a Catholic priest or Lutheran pastor.

Luckily, as it proved in the end for Charlie, he had fallen into the
hands of Landwehr men alone, for ere long, conceiving him to be dead,
they took him out of the waggon and left him at the door of a
mansion, which proved to be the Chateau de CaillÃ©.

Prior to this, as the waggon was driven slowly and tortuously, to
avoid mutilating the killed and wounded, who lay thickly everywhere,
in literal heaps in some places, in ranks in others, the moon went
down, clouds overspread the sky, and, to add to the miseries of the
helpless, rain began to fall.  In the action of the previous day, the
canopy of the waggon in which Charlie Pierrepont lay had been
destroyed by a passing shot.  No other had been substituted, so there
he Jay, with seven others, packed closely side by side, some dying,
some actually dead, with the rain of heaven pouring into their open
months and eyes.

Some there were who stirred restlessly from side to side, constantly
requesting their position to be shifted, as the agonies of death came
on; and when they died they were lifted from the waggon and laid by
the side of the way.

To the grim corps of grave-diggers was assigned the duty of noting
the neck-labels, and doing what was necessary then!

As Charlie lay very still and motionless with eyes closed, sunk
indeed into a species of stupor, the unskilled men of the Landwehr
concluded that he was dead, and lifting him from the waggon, laid him
near the gate of the chateau, and drove off, just as grey dawn began
to brighten on the wooded hills that look down, the Moselle, and the
great spire of the distant cathedral of Metz.

So there he was left to be killed, perhaps outright, by the first
vindictive peasant of Lorraine who might be going a-field to his
work; but there was too much gunpowder in the air about Metz just
then to permit other work to be done than 'the harvest of death.'

Now, before those terrible fellows in spike-helmets came into that
peaceful part of pleasant Lorraine, where the old chateau lies
embosomed among vineyards and apple-bowers--the Lorraine that whilom
belonged to the mother of Mary Queen of Scots--it had been the wont
and custom of CÃ©landine de CaillÃ©, at the hour of seven every
morning, to go to early mass in a little chapel near the highway that
leads to Metz.  She dared not venture so far now; but by mere force
of habit, she was saying the prayers for mass among the dew-drops in
the flower-garden, when something caused her to peep out of the front
gate, and then she saw----  What?  Oh, it could not be!

Was this pale, ghastly, sodden, and blood-stained creature the
handsome young soldier who, but yesterday morning about the same
hour, after being startled by the Uhlan trumpet, had marched away so
proudly at the head of his Thuringians, with his silver epaulettes
glittering in the sun, and had yet in his havresack--soaked with his
own gore--the food so kindly placed there by CÃ©landine?

It seemed incredible, yet so it was!

A shriek escaped the startled girl, and she rushed indoors for her
father, her _bonne_, and everybody else; assistance was soon
procured, the sufferer carried indoors, placed in bed, his uniform
hidden, for the Francs-Tireurs were hovering about, and medical aid
was procured from the nearest village, in the person of a young
doctor, Adolphe Guerrand, on whom, as an admirer of CÃ©landine, they
could rely for silence and secrecy.

The thunder of war was an awful event to the inmates of that little
secluded chateau, to none more than to Monsieur de CaillÃ©, whose days
were usually spent in dozing about his flower-garden, plucking off a
faded leaf here and there, or training vines and sprays, and whose
evenings were passed over a bottle of vin ordinaire with the CurÃ©, or
listening to CÃ©landine's performances on a--well, it was _not_ a
grand trichord piano, because it had been her grandmother's.

Some days and nights elapsed--strange, drearily days and nights to
Charlie Pierrepont, who only knew at times where, by a strange
coincidence, he was.  They were passed by him in a chaos or confusion
of thought, in dreams of Ernestine, of the day in the Hoch Munster,
and the evening in the church at Burtscheid, of battle-fields, with
lines of red kepis, fierce bearded faces, and hedges of bristling
bayonets looming through the smoke, of the roaring shriek of those
dreadful mitrailleuses--the veritable invention of Satan; yea, even
the scowl and curse of the French captain were not forgotten; but
after a time Charlie's thoughts became coherent; he knew fully where
he was; that a conical rifle bullet had been cut out of his back,
near the spine, by the skilful hands of Adolphe Guerrand; that he had
a narrow escape from death; that he was recovering, and had, as
nurses, CÃ©landine de CaillÃ© and her kind old _bonne_.

'Ah!  CÃ©landine--Mademoiselle CÃ©landine,' said he, taking the girl's
tiny hand within his own, and just touching it with his lips,
'neither your holy water, nor the consecrated medal, acted as a
charm.  In what a condition have I come back to you!'

'But for my medal and the holy water, perhaps a cannon-ball might
have taken off your head,' retorted little Mademoiselle de CaillÃ©.

'True,' replied Charlie, as he kissed her hand again.

Three weeks had elapsed since the battle in which Charlie had fallen
wounded; two days after, as CÃ©landine told him, Gravelotte had been
fought, and then the French had been defeated after a dreadful
struggle, and driven back to Metz.  Strasbourg was besieged,
Phalsburg bombarded, the Prussians were daily everywhere victorious.

'And, alas! monsieur,' said the little maid, clasping her pretty
hands, and lifting upward eyes that were suffused with tears, 'France
is lost!  The glory of my France is gone!  And surely now the cries
of Melusine will be heard!'

'Melusine?' asked Charlie, with surprise.  'Who is she?'

'Don't you know, monsieur?  Have you never heard of the "_Cris de
Melusine_?"'

'Never.'

'It is an old legend believed in by most of our peasantry.  BrantÃ´me
says she is a spirit that haunts the old castle of Lusignan, where,
by loud shrieks, she announces any disasters that are to befall
France.'

'She must have been shrieking pretty loud and long of late,' said
Charlie, smiling at the earnestness of the girl, who, in her love of
the legendary, reminded him, he thought, of Ernestine, and he liked
her the better for it.

So Charlie continued to be attended daily by the young Doctor
Guerrand, and nursed by CÃ©landine in secret, as it would have been
perilous for Charlie had the exasperated peasantry learned that a
Prussian officer was concealed in the chateau.  The heart of the
young French doctor Guerrand was full of bitterness for the disgrace
that was falling on his country, and, were it not that by his
practice he supported an aged mother, he would have cast aside the
lancet and betaken to the chassepot.

'_Sacre!_' said he, on one occasion, to Charlie; 'in this war the
French seem to make more use of their feet than their hands; but we
won't talk of politics.'

'Why, Doctor?'

'Because I always lose my temper.  I am a Republican now.  I have
become so in the bitterness of my heart.  But, thank Heaven, we shall
soon be rid of our Emperor, as you will, ere long, of your Kaiser;
for what are kings, emperors, and princes, but a crowned confederacy
against the freedom of the world?  _Sacre!_'

And the young Republican ground his teeth in his fierce energy.

Charlie had Ernestine's photo, done and coloured at Aix-la-Chapelle.
It was one which, so far as these sun pictures go, represented her to
the life, and he had seen her in that particular posÃ©, and with that
expression on her soft face, many, many times.  He kept it beneath
his pillow.  Never did he tire of gazing on it; thus, more than once,
his active little nurse caught him with the blue velvet case in his
hand.

'Ah!  It is monsieur's mother?' said she, trying to get a peep at it.

'It is not,' said Charlie, with a fond smile.

'A sister, then?  I have seen that it is a lady!'

'No, CÃ©landine.'

'Something as dear as both would be?'

'I cannot say.'

'How so, monsieur?'

'I scarcely ever saw my mother.  And when I left home to soldier in
Prussia, my sisters were mere children; but dear she is, indeed.'

'Ah,--a _fiancÃ©e_?' said CÃ©landine, laughing and clapping her hands.

'Yes, mademoiselle.'

'Ah, show me the likeness, monsieur,' she entreated; so Charlie gave
her the case.  'How sweet, how lovely she looks!  Do let me kiss her!
Monsieur Pierrepont, I congratulate you.  And when are you to be
married?'

'Alas!' muttered Charlie, as his countenance fell.

'Surely she loves you?' asked CÃ©landine, with her blue eyes dilated.

'Loves me?--dearly! so each of us has one secret of the heart to
treasure.'

'What have I?' asked the girl, demurely.

'You have Adolphe.'

'Ah!--yes; M. Adolphe loves me, I believe, and--and perhaps I may
learn to love him in time.  I am not sure.  I may marry some one
else, and learn to love that some one.  Mon pÃ¨re will arrange all
that for me, and it will be so kind of him.'

Charlie looked puzzled; but ere long, in the case of CÃ©landine
herself, he was to see how matrimonial matters are arranged in the
land of the silver lilies.

Her question, 'When are you to be married?' opened up no new train of
thought to Charlie; that important _when_ had been a source of
frequent and painful surmise; but a new idea was ever before him now.

What had Ernestine heard of his fate?--that he was killed, wounded,
or missing?  He had no means of communicating with her now, and thus
sparing her that which he would gladly have done--a single sigh, a
single throb of pain.

There was no one at the chateau could tell him where the 95th were,
whether in front of Metz, besieging Strasbourg, or fighting at
Phalsburg.  But, oh, how to relieve the grief of his betrothed!  He
would not, for worlds, have cost that warm, wilful, and impassioned
heart one pang!

Yet there he lay on his back, with a closing wound, helpless.

Like an iron weight it bore on his heart, the remoteness and dubiety
of their meeting again; and when all thought of his personal danger
passed away, this reflection weighed more heavily on him than ever,
while his very career as a soldier made the future more uncertain and
gloomy.

He had but one fixed, yet vague, idea--that, at the risk of his life,
he would see Ernestine before he returned to the regiment in which he
was, as yet, unfit to serve, and assure her of his all-unaltered
love.  Times there were when he thought he would ask CÃ©landine to
write to her, but in turn was afraid to do so--to Herminia, or to
Ernestine, over whose postal correspondence, doubtless, the Countess
kept a strict vigil--or, if she did write, there was no other post
than the field one between France and Prussia now, and that was with
the German army.

So Charlie could but lie on his bed and writhe, though in the kindly
hands of the sweetest of little nurses.

Would the Countess Adelaide, he sometimes asked himself, feel any
compunction for her proud severity, any pity for her daughter's
honest lover, on hearing of his probable fate?  Alas! it seemed more
likely that she would exult at it as a barrier, a bramble, removed
from her path.  The Count was an old soldier; perhaps he might relent
and prove generous; and so, on and on, Charlie hoped, surmised, and
pondered, till his very brain ached.

CÃ©landine knew that Charlie was English by birth, yet Prussian by
sympathy, which she deplored--they were such barbarians, those men in
the spiked helmets.  Thus when she played or sang to him, which she
did with great taste and sweetness, with good taste she only chose
neutral airs and songs, such as those from the Trovatore, etc., and
in these Adolphe Guerrand frequently joined her.

As she was in her mere girlhood, it appeared that she was too young
to marry, nor had ever thought of it; and more than all, as Adolphe
was poor, having only his practice as a hard-working village
practitioner, Monsieur de CaillÃ© was by no means disposed to look
upon him, even in the future, as an eligible suitor for his daughter,
till a letter reached young Guerrand from Paris by which one morning
he found himself rich by one of the most extraordinary chances in the
world.

It happened that just a week before the Prussians crossed the Rhine,
Adolphe Guerrand had been at Blankenberg with a patient, to whom he
had prescribed sea-bathing, and, when walking on the beach there, had
found a carefully sealed bottle among some sea-weed.  Holding it
between him and the light, he saw that it contained a written
document, and conceiving naturally that it was a message from the
sea--the last farewell from some sinking ship, he drew the cork, and
perused the damp paper, which was properly signed and dated, from on
board a French vessel, which had sprung a leak, and was going down in
the middle of the Atlantic.  And thus it ran on, in French:


'About to perish by drowning, I commend my soul to God, the Blessed
Virgin, and all the saints.  I hereby constitute my sole heir the
finder of this will, which I enclose in a glass bottle.  The labour
of years, my fortune amounts to two hundred and twenty thousand
francs, and I am without a relation in the world.  I wish the house I
have resided in at Paris to be converted into a chapel of St.
Dominique, my patron saint.  The fortune is deposited in the hands of
the notary, M. Vantin, in the Rue St. HonorÃ©.  _Ora pro me_.

'DOMINIQUE SOURDEVAL.'


The letter was from Vantin, the notary, to the young doctor, who thus
found himself suddenly rich, so all obstacles were removed to a union
with CÃ©landine, when she was a few years older, though the family of
Adolphe was of humble origin and that of De CaillÃ© ancient, and shone
at the court of Louis XIII.  It was of a Madame de CaillÃ© that we are
told, how when that monarch was once playing at shuttlecock with her
at Versailles, it fell into her bosom, on which she desired his
majesty to take it; but such was his royal delicacy that, to avoid
the snare laid by the charming Lorrainer, he discreetly extricated
the toy with the aid of the tongs.

Thus, on the first day of Charlie's convalescence, the formal
betrothal of the daughter of the house took place; and to him it
seemed a very cold-blooded affair to the wild, passionate, and solemn
episode between himself and Ernestine in that lonely church at
Burtscheid.

Adolphe was in his twenty-fifth year, naturally sanguine and
enthusiastic; his clear-cut features and thoughtful eyes were now
full of light and brightness; there was a greater springiness in his
step, born of the knowledge that he was now rich and the inheritor of
a fortune--the fortune of M. de Sourdeval, so mysteriously cast at
his feet by the waves of the sea.

A well-bred French girl, of course, expects one day to be wedded, but
chiefly looks forward to the event as an opportunity of displaying
her presents and trousseau, and is supposed to have no preference in
the matter.  To CÃ©landine it seemed only natural that she should
accept her father's choice, just as he had done the choice of _his_
parents in espousing her mother.

Yet in her heart of hearts, the girl--though very young--had grown
fond of Charlie Pierrepont, her helpless charge, who was always so
gentle and grateful, so sad, too, and who looked, withal, so manly
and soldier-like.  And with this sentiment in her heart, the girl was
to contract what we must call a French marriage.  So full of
cross-purposes, hidden currents of thought, and secret springs of
action, is this work-a-day world of ours!

She knew that it is understood and accepted in her native country
that unions cannot, as in England, be contracted on the impulse of
love or romantic notions, but upon principles of cold and practical
utility, as mere transactions between parents; but they are sometimes
equally so on this side of the Straits of Dover.

So, on the day referred to, M. de CaillÃ© said to his daughter, with
his eyebrows elevated as if he had quite made a discovery, while
kissing her on the forehead, 'I have found you a husband, my love.'

'Merci, mon pÃ¨re--who is he?' asked CÃ©landine, as if she had not the
slightest guess on the subject.

'The time will come anon--but here he is,' and he led in Adolphe, who
approached CÃ©landine, whose eyes were fixed on Charlie, pale, wan,
and propping himself on a cane of M. de CaillÃ©'s.

At such a crisis, Adolphe Guerrand had vague ideas--from what he had
read in novels and seen at the theatre of the Porte St. Martin, when
he was a student in Paris, at the Ecole de Medicin--that he should
drop on his knees, or at least on one knee; but the floor was very
slippery, and CÃ©landine not being much in love with him, and very
much inclined to laugh, he didn't attempt a melodramatic posÃ© at this
betrothal, which Charlie saw as in a dream; for his thoughts were at
Burtscheid, and the heart-stirring parting words of Ernestine were
lingering in his ear.




CHAPTER XX.

ERNESTINE.

As the reader may suppose, some time elapsed ere the quiet little
household at Frankfort realized--they could not for long recover
from--the catastrophe recorded by the German papers; but when it was
actually stated that a prisoner taken in a skirmish, a captain, was
roasted alive, nothing seemed too horrible to happen now.  That
Heinrich might be wounded unto death, or slain outright in battle,
seemed but a too probable contingency; but that he should be taken
prisoner, and suffer an end of such enforced ignominy, was beyond the
category of all their speculations.

The whole family were utterly prostrated by an event so inexplicable,
and Ernestine felt the shock in her own peculiar way.  She loved her
only brother dearly, and all the more dearly that he was the friend
and defender of her lover Carl--her betrothed husband, for as such
she always viewed him.  Now that her beloved Heinrich was gone, the
links between her and Carl--the means of communication--were broken,
and she could hear of him no more.

And, meanwhile, where was Carl?  Alive or dead?

The _Gazette_, so grudging in words, so meagre in detail, had simply
said that he was severely wounded.  Where, and in what fashion, was
he wounded?  By steel or lead?  Was he mutilated, disfigured for
life?  Perhaps he had since perished in his agony, or when undergoing
some terrible operation!

So, for days and nights, the girl tormented herself till she became
seriously ill with agonizing conjectures, over which she was
compelled to brood in silence and tears.

At last, to the astonishment, to the wild joy of all, there came a
letter from Heinrich himself--a letter dated ten days subsequent to
the catastrophe recorded in the _Extra Blatt_!

It was dated from a village somewhere near Metz, and briefly
recapitulated what has been detailed in Chapter Eighteen, and added
that a humane peasant woman, who, from a hiding-place, had witnessed
the terrible scene in the garden, the moment the Francs-Tireurs
retired, had rushed forth and cut him down.  She had quickly and
adroitly released his neck from the odious cord, chafed it with her
hands, given him water, and thoroughly revived him, though animation
had never been quite suspended.

Moreover, she had concealed him in her house for two days, and
enabled him to join the regiment before Metz; but the shock to his
system was such that the military surgeons advised his return home
for a time, and that, doubtless, he would spend his Christmas with
them all at Frankenburg.

They had all mourned so deeply over his supposed terrible fate, that
the account this letter contained--the assurance of his perfect
safety and speedy return in his own handwriting--seemed like a
resurrection from the tomb!  All the family embraced each other and
shed tears of joy, and a new and sudden happiness was diffused over
the whole household, even to the grooms in the stable, for all loved
the handsome young Graf.

An enormous amount of beer was consumed on the occasion, and in 'the
study,' the Count and Baron GrÃ¼nthal over their pipes, and certainly
more than one bottle of Rhenish wine, grasped each other's hands ever
and anon, and shouted, in the melodious language of the Vaterland,

'Hoch, Heinrich!  Ich habe die Ehre, auf Ihre Gesundheit zu trinken!'
(I have the honour of drinking your good health.)

In his letter there was no mention of Carl Pierrepont, and no
enclosure for _her_, thought Ernestine; but then, as Heinrich wrote
to the Countess, he could not make a communication concerning him; so
the girl, though her joy for her brother's safety was somewhat
clouded by that circumstance and the wish that Heinrich had written
to Herminia; could but wait and hope--hope and pray.

'A little time, and my dear brother will tell me all,' she said to
herself; 'but, oh! this suspense--this mystery concerning the fate of
my Carl, is intolerable!'

And now, in the excess of their happiness, the intended marriage of
her and the Baron was revived in greater force than ever.  Heinrich
was returning, and his presence would make the happiness of all
complete.  Daily, Ernestine, while scanning the papers with keen and
haggard eyes for intelligence of the lost one, heard the marriage
arrangement schemed out; the projected breakfast; the cake which was
to come from the most celebrated confectioner in Aix; the
_trousseau_, which was to come from the most fashionable Putzmacherin
(or _modiste_) in Berlin; the feast in the hall, and who were to be
invited; whether the honeymoon was to be spent at Wiesbaden, at
Carlsbad, or Bruckenau, and the girl listened to them as if she had
been turned to stone.  But there is a writer who says, 'Age
legislates and youth trespasses; but the tide of love no more recedes
at a _bidding_, than King Canute's waves.'

Only once, however, did the sympathizing Herminia think her pale
cousin was about to yield, when one night she laid her head on her
bosom, and said with a gasping shudder,

'Oh, how terrible it is to give one's hand to the living when one's
heart has been given to the dead!'

'But your dear Carl may not be dead.  Heinrich is returning.'

Other times there were when she would not believe that he was dead,
yet how many brave hearts were growing cold in death then all over
Northern France!  How many men yet were to perish among the blushing
vineyards of Champagne, and under the beleaguered walls of Paris!

The cruel _Blatt_ had only said he had been wounded.  But how had he
disappeared?

'He will return--oh, yet he will return!  Kind God, you would not
take him from me!'

And in the fervour of such a moment she would lift her streaming eyes
upward with a trustful and angelic expression.

Like Charlie, when in many a comfortless bivouac under the sky and
dew of heaven, under canvas when the summer rain pattered on the tent
roof within an inch of his nose, of when in his bed tossing
restlessly at the Chateau de CaillÃ©, how many wild, strange, and
impracticable plans and schemes did the busy mind of Ernestine frame,
to reconstruct and hopelessly destroy again!  Time, possibility, and
the usages of life--and especially of her position in life, she
overleaped with wonderful facility, so impulsive was she, but to fall
back panting, as it were, and without one ray of hope, till she
became, as we have said, like a stone, yet love lived on.

Times there were when she imagined, or strove to imagine, that she
had eloped with Charlie; that he had cast epaulettes, sword, and
military reputation to the winds, and all for her sake; and that she
was rambling with him among those lovely woods and sylvan scenes he
had so often described to her, the scenes of his native home in
Warwick.  They did not require a huge schloss; they could be so happy
in a little cottage, and she was certain that she could milk a cow,
if she tried.

Charlie she must and would see again at all hazards!  Were they not
each other's unto death--vowed in life and death?  Even now _where_
he was, she knew not, wist not; but in imagination she felt his arm
pressing her hand to his side; she saw his brave and tender gaze of
love into her eyes till they seemed to droop beneath the magnetism of
it; she felt his kisses on their snowy lids, on her hair and on her
brow, and all his soft uttered whispers come to memory again.  And as
she thought over all these things, the girl clasped her hot white
hands in agony by day, and tossed feverishly and restlessly on her
pillow by night.

At last Heinrich returned, to the increased joy of all and the
thoughts of Ernestine went back to that evening when, from the
terrace, she had watched Carl, driving in the britzka towards the
Schloss--her Carl, then a stranger to her save by name, but who was
now so dear!  Heinrich looked well and strong, sun-browned and
bold-eyed, and as the Count said, after kissing him on both cheeks,
and giving him a kindly thwack on the back, 'not a whit the worse for
his hanging!'

And now utterly regardless of what her parents might think or say,
oblivious alike of their anger and their absurd pride, Ernestine, in
her, usual passionate way, threw herself into her brother's arms, and
cried in a piercing voice:

'Oh, Heinrich, what news of _him_, of Carl? tell me, my brother--my
brother, lest I die.'

'I have no news, dear sister; the regiment has heard nothing of him
since the battle of the 14th of August, before Metz,' replied
Heinrich, speaking with great reluctance, being alike loath to wound
his tender sister, or in that moment of their happiness to offend his
parents.  But now her father spoke, and calmly too.

'The _Blatt_ stated that the Herr Lieutenant was wounded?'

'Yes, when we were storming a mitrailleuse battery.'

'Did you see him fall?'

'No, Herr Graf.  The smoke was thick, and I was on the left of the
line, he on the right, in SchÃ¶nforst's company.  Poor SchÃ¶nforst--he
fell there, literally torn to shreds!'

'What certainty is there that Here Pierrepont was wounded at all?'
asked the Count, very desirous to learn that it was all over with
poor Charlie, while Ernestine hung on her brother's words in agony.

'His company saw him struck.  He was leading them bravely on after
SchÃ¶nforst's death.  Our doctor patched up his wound in some fashion;
but on returning at night, could find no trace of him.'

'Where was the wound?' asked Ernestine, with quivering lips.

'In the breast--we shall hear all about it ere long,' continued
Heinrich, putting an arm kindly round his sister.  'He is doubtless
in some of the many hospitals that are near the fields where we have
been fighting.'

'Bah! the Herr Englander has probably tired of fighting, gone home to
his own country, and will trouble Prussia no more!' said the Countess.

Heinrich thought it much more probable that he had crawled away
somewhere and died unseen, or, to judge from his own experience, been
murdered by the peasantry; but he kept these ideas to himself.  On
the first opportunity when they were alone, Ernestine had a thousand
questions to ask Heinrich; but to the fate--the disappearance of
Pierrepont, he could not give the faintest clue, though to feed her
hopes, when he had none, he drew largely on his imagination; for he
knew that unless Charlie were dead, or most severely wounded indeed,
and quite helpless, which we have shown him to be, he would have put
himself in communication with the nearest Prussian military
authorities.

So, from the day of Heinrich's return, the health and spirits of
Ernestine sank painfully and visibly.

Summer had passed away, and the tints of autumn, brown and yellow,
russet and orange, stole over the woodlands around the old Schloss
and the beautiful dingles of the Reichswald.  In vain were daily
drives in the open carriage resorted to, and in vain were doctors
consulted; the cheek of Ernestine grew paler and thinner; her
roundness of form was passing away, and the once lovely hand becoming
all but transparent.  Had sure tidings come that Charlie had been
killed outright, and, was actually dead, she might have got over the
shock; but the suspense of not knowing where he was, how
circumstanced, how mutilated, whether in his grave or still lingering
in the land of the living, proved too much for a girl so sensitively
organized as Ernestine.

One fact was certain, as Heinrich's letters from the Thuringians
assured her, that nothing had been heard of him by the regiment as
yet.  Owing to her state of health, the Countess's favourite topic
and plan of the marriage was abandoned for the time, and in that
matter she obtained some temporary relief.

The poor girl really was, to all appearance, in a rapid consumption;
but in all her family, hale, hearty, and strong on both sides, such
an ailment had never been known.  The whole tenor of her ways was
changed.  Even her pets--and she had many--were forgotten now.

The winter would come, and with it Christmas, and to that festival
Ernestine looked forward with a kind of horror now.  Would it be
jovial as usual in the old ancestral hall of Frankenburg?  Doubtless
the glittering Christmas tree--a pine from the Reichswald--would be
there as of old, as it had been for generations; and there would be
the venison pasty, and the brown shining boar's head to be solemnly
cut and jovially eaten; speeches would be made, and toasts drunk with
many a merry 'hoch!' while her heart would be with the German army
before beleaguered Paris, or in the grave, where she feared her Carl
lay; so she hoped as Christmas came that her place in Frankenburg
would be vacant.

The girl's mind was a prey to suspense and fear, sorrow and
love--love, the strongest of all human passions.

We have said that her nervous organization was delicate; hence these
mental affections, together with incessant anxiety, threw her into a
species of rapid consumption, which the presence and restoration of
'her Carl,' as she always called him, alone could cure or arrest.
She had a dry cough, a quick small pulse, a burning heat in her
hands, a loss of strength, and sinking of the eyes, and her state
became such at last that the Countess begged the Baron to absent
himself from the Schloss for a time, as his visits there were a
source of perpetual annoyance to Ernestine, though, for some time
past, she secluded herself in her own room.

Now her mother began to wring her hands, and pray that Heaven would
find for her this Herr Pierrepont, if his presence, even if tolerated
for a time, would restore her sinking child.

Again and again did Heinrich write and telegraph to the head-quarters
of the Thuringians concerning Charlie; but nothing had been heard of
him there, and all were certain that he must have been killed in the
action on the 14th of the preceding August.

Poor Ernestine!  Her case was soon pronounced hopeless.  Her beauty
remained; but it was of a strange and weird kind.  On each cheek was
a hectic spot; her eyes, sunken in their sockets, had an unnatural
brightness; she spoke little, and laughed never.

A little time more, and she was confined to her bed, where she lay
for hours with her hot hand clasped in that of Herminia's, who bathed
her temples with Rimmel and eau de Cologne, and fanned and petted
her, while she tossed on her pillow, and muttered 'Carl!  Carl!'

It was always Carl.

Often when she spoke, her dark eyes flashed up, like the momentary
flicker of a lamp about to go out for ever--on earth, at least.

'Oh, Herminia, darling!' she said on one occasion; 'life has no
charms, and death has no terrors for me now.'

'Carl will return.'

'Never!  Or it may be that he will come _too late_.  Yet, even then,'
she added, with a strange bright smile, that terrified her weeping
cousin, 'even then I may see him, for it is among the possibilities
of this world that the dead may return again!'

'Strange weird words!  What does she--what _can_ she mean?' thought
Herminia.

Some days after this she became almost speechless; yet she was quite
conscious, and looked so lovely with the dishevelled masses of her
dark hair floating over her laced pillow and delicate neck, as she
smiled tenderly on her mother, Herminia, and all who hovered about
her.  Yet ever she whispered to herself, 'Carl!  Carl!'

On his last visit the doctor looked very grave as he departed.

'Can nothing be done to save her?' implored the Countess, in a
tremulous voice.

'Nothing in my power, Grafine.  Her disease is of the mind--the mind
alone.  Your daughter--I deplore to say it--is dying!'

'Of what, Herr Doctor?  Of what?

'To me, it seems--of a broken heart!'

'Impossible!' replied the Countess; 'people do not die of broken
hearts, and grief does not kill.'




CHAPTER XXI.

AT AIX ONCE MORE.

So, like Heinrich, Charlie had fallen into the 'enemy's hands;' but
fortunately for him, they were the soft and gentle ones of little
CÃ©landine de CaillÃ©.

The passage of the ball had seriously injured him internally; thus he
was long in recovering, and the winter of the year was almost at hand
ere he could venture to travel; but it now seemed imperative to
Charlie that he should trespass on his host and hostess no longer.

'You would spoil any man with kindness, Mademoiselle de CaillÃ©,' said
he, one day; 'or any dog, too.'

'Often the most loving animal of the two,' replied the French girl,
laughing.

During that protracted convalescence how often, in the waking hours
of the night, had he thought of Ernestine, and strove to sleep in the
hope to dream of her; of their moonlight walks in the garden of the
old Schloss, when she had held his arm, with her little hands
interlaced so confidingly on his sleeve, and he used to pet and
caress them as she leant with all her weight upon his wrist; or of
the mad gallops they were wont to have through the glades and dingles
of the lovely Reichswald, when the green woods seemed to sleep under
the dusky purple of the summer sky; but one night he had a dream that
startled, and, like that one in the bivouac, made a deep impression
upon him by its vividness and the sense of pain it left.

In imagination she bent over him sadly and caressingly; her dark eyes
were tender and beautiful as of old; but the rose-leaf tint had left
her cheeks, as if for ever.  Her smile was full of sweetness.  Then a
change came suddenly over her; the soft light died out of her eyes;
her cheeks became hollow, her lips pallid; her whole expression and
aspect painful and ghastly; the grasp of her hands became cold and
chilling, and her voice grew faint and husky, as she said,

'At Burtscheid, dearest Carl; meet me at Burtscheid, where last we
met.'

Then she seemed to melt away from before him, and Charlie started and
awoke, to find it was happily but a mere dream, born too probably of
his nervous and enfeebled condition, yet one so vivid, we have
said--so terrifically vivid and painful, that he was trembling in
every limb, a cold perspiration covered his whole frame; and by some
strange association of ideas, the dying curse, if curse it was, of
the French captain came rushing on his memory.

And now the time came when he was to leave the Chateau de CaillÃ©.

'And you go, you go to her,' said CÃ©landine, making a great effort to
appear calm, on the day of his departure.

'To her whose miniature I showed you, dear friend yes.'

'Oh, may you both be happy--very, very happy!'

'I thank you, dear CÃ©landine; you will ever have her gratitude, as
well as mine; but there are many things to oppose, many interests to
thwart our happiness.'

'Alas!' said the French girl, sadly; 'but remember that nothing is
_impossible_.'

And so when Charlie Pierrepont left his kind friends and that
charming part of Lorraine, he little knew that he left behind a warm
girlish heart that yearned for him, and him only, and thought nothing
of Monsieur Adolphe, with all his thousands of francs, her father's
choice; and keenly she envied her--the unknown lady--whose miniature
was in Charlie's heart.

From the surgeon of a Prussian regiment at SaarbrÃ¼ck, Charlie
Pierrepont got a medical certificate, to the effect that he was
incapable of rejoining the Thuringians, or of serving for some time.
Leave was given him by the general in command, and he took the train
from SaarbrÃ¼ck to Aix, to be near Frankenburg and her, of whom he had
heard nothing for all those months, that seemed like so many ages
now; for Charlie was so much of a lover, that to breathe the same
atmosphere with her was a source of joy.

Yet it was a cold and frosty atmosphere now, for Christmas was close
at hand, the time when Christmas trees are lighted, when arcades and
toyshops, fruiterers and pastry-cooks drive a roaring trade, when
circles long separated are reunited, and happy parents sit at the
head of happy tables surrounded by shining faces.

The Reichswald was leafless and bare now, and a mantle of snow
covered all those heights that surround Aix, which seems to lie in 'a
fertile bowl surrounded by bold hills;' and ice lay in masses about
the boats of the pontoon bridge of the Rhine.  It was on the evening
of the third Thursday before the great festival of the Christian year
that Charlie found himself in the brilliant speise-saal of the Grand
Monarque.

He was now within a very short distance of Frankenburg; but how was
he to communicate with Ernestine?  See her he must before
Christmas-eve, or she could not meet him then; and the hunger, the
craving of his heart, was too great to be endured long.  He feared to
write to Herminia, lest his handwriting might be recognised by the
Countess, and to write to Ernestine would too probably be useless, as
her correspondence was too probably under her mother's supervision.

What if she should now be the Baroness GrÃ¼nthal?  For months no one
had known anything of his existence.  All might have believed him to
be dead, and she, perhaps yielding to the influences around her; but
no, no--he thrust that thought aside, and recalled the solemnity of
their vows interchanged at Burtscheid.

Had she not then, and on that eventful night in the boudoir, promised
to be faithful to him in life and death? and Charlie smiled at his
momentary doubt.

How many people there are in this world who treasure up and con over
and over again an impossible day-dream that may never come to pass!
Charlie thought of this as, from the hotel windows, he gazed moodily
into the snow-covered street, with all its bustle and lamps, and
shrank from the passing fear that his aspirations after Ernestine
might only be an impossible and unrealizable longing; but see her
again he must, even if he went to the Schloss--but no, that would
never do after the treatment he had experienced there, and the
epithets applied to him by the Countess.

Suddenly he observed near him, while lingering over his wine in the
speise-saal, which had emptied of guests, the Baron Rhineberg and, of
all men in the world, Baron GrÃ¼nthal, busy with their meerschaums and
tankards of beer.  Both seemed very quiet and taciturn; they had been
speaking very little, which perhaps was the reason that, in his
abstraction, they had hitherto been unnoticed by Charlie, who now
held up the _Staats Anzeiger_ between them and him, as he had no wish
to be recognised by either.  However, they were a link between him
and Frankenburg, so he could not help listening intently to whatever
they said.

They were talking at slow intervals of some recent sorrow they had
sustained; but so great was the slaughter of the French war, that
everyone in Germany then was wearing crape or mourning for the loss
of some friend.

'Ach Gott--yes,' said Rhineberg; 'it is certainly a great calamity
even to the city of Aachen.'

'When I saw the black flag flying on the old Schloss,' responded
Grunthal, 'and the hatchment with its sixteen quarters over the gate,
I--I knew that the dreaded event had taken place at last.'

'That we had lost a dear friend?'

'Yes.  The poor old Graf!' said GrÃ¼nthal, with a sigh.

Charlie felt startled--almost inclined to speak and discover himself,
but restrained the inclination, and listened intently, thinking,
'Well, the poor old veteran of Ligny and Waterloo could not be
expected to live for ever.'

'He has never suffered more, I think,' said Rhineberg, after taking a
long pull at his pipe, and watching the smoke thoughtfully as it
ascended in concentric rings towards the lofty ceiling of the
speise-saal, 'never, since that morning when the devilish _Extra
Blatt_ had in it the mutilated telegram concerning the capture of
Heinrich by the Francs-Tireurs.'

'And the severe wounding--was it not mortally?--of the Englander,
Herr Pierrepont,' added Grunthal, with something in his throat that
sounded, as Charlie thought, exceedingly like a chuckle of
satisfaction.

But Heinrich, his dear friend and comrade, had been taken by the
Francs-Tireurs!  Knowing, from experience, how the Francs-Tireurs and
the Prussians were in the habit of handling each other, this was an
event to cause him anxiety, but, as it happened, only for a few
minutes.

Would the death of the Count in any way release Ernestine from
parental thraldom?  Though he felt genuine sympathy for her natural
grief, he could not very much regret the event; 'and yet,' thought
Charlie, 'the poor old fellow was always kind to me.'

'It is most fortunate,' said Rhineberg, after a little pause, 'that
the young Graf Heinrich is at home during such a terrible crisis.'

'Most fortunate for his mother, and all.'

So Heinrich was at Frankenburg, and not with the old 95th before the
walls of Paris!  This was indeed most welcome news for Charlie!  More
than once he had been on the verge of speaking, as his curiosity had
been keenly excited, but repressed the inclination; he did not wish
that his presence in Aix should be known to the Countess, and to
address GrÃ¼nthal, his acknowledged rival, or competitor, rather, was
altogether an intolerable idea, so quitting the speise-saal softly,
he hastened to his own room.

Then he wrote rapidly a long and explanatory letter to Ernestine,
full of all the deepest, most tender, and passionate thoughts of his
heart, telling her of his presence at Aix, and beseeching her to meet
him.  He recalled the dream in which she had asked him to meet him at
Burtscheid.

'At Burtscheid, be it,' he wrote, 'at the same hour, dear, dear
Ernestine, when last we met there; and I shall give you a strange
souvenir of the war--the bullet that pierced my breast, and has been
the means, perhaps, of keeping me so long from you.  At Burtscheid,
then, my darling.'

This letter he despatched under cover to Heinrich, and felt more
happy and composed than he had been since last he saw her.

He knew that his letter would be delivered by the post at Frankenburg
in the morning.

Probably Heinrich would visit his hotel during the day, and he knew
that at all risks--unless something most extraordinary
intervened--Ernestine, who had such strength of will, would contrive
to meet him in the old church.

All the following day Charlie lingered about the Grand Monarque, but
Heinrich never came; doubtless the business or calamity to which the
Barons referred had detained him.

Then a fear came over Charlie that the same event might prevent
Ernestine meeting him, as she might be deprived of her brother's
escort.

But if she failed to come, a messenger of some kind might meet him at
Burtscheid.




CHAPTER XXII.

AT BURTSCHEID.

'In five hours--in four--in two,' and so on he reckoned, 'I shall see
her again--my darling! my darling!'

At last the wished-for time came when he was to set forth on that
walk which--he fondly, ardently, and tenderly hoped--was to end in
_her_ presence; but, as he walked down the leafless avenue from the
city, he felt his heart become tremulous, almost sick with anxiety
and fear, lest she should be unable to meet him, even after all the
months of separation undergone; yet his was a heart that never
quailed, even when he faced that battery in the wood--a battery that
was not of cannon, but mitrailleuses!

Anon as he proceeded, something of Ernestine's high and strange
enthusiasm gathered in his breast.

Even if he were fated never to wed her, he felt that she was the one
great passion of his life, a worship almost spiritualized, and that
beyond the trammels of this material world, he would follow her,
faithful and unchanged, into that to come.

Then he almost smiled to think how German the tone of his mind was
becoming.

The evening sky was cloudless, and wore a kind of pale violet tint,
amid which the stars sparkled out brilliantly.

The trees of the avenue between the city and Burtscheid were covered
with rimy frost, which made their branches seem to coruscate and
glitter in myriad prisms.  Frost was on the pathway; it shone on the
stems and twigs, on the stalks and blades of the wayside plants; snow
covered all the district, yet the air was far from being cold.

At last the old church of Burtscheid rose before him again.  In
another minute or two, he would have clasped her to his breast, where
he had clasped her last--at the altar-rail--when those sad and sweet
and solemn vows were interchanged.

In that moment the campaign in Alsace and Lorraine, danger, duty,
wound, and suffering, were all forgotten; nothing was in his mind but
the intense happiness of the event to come.

He was conscious enough of the tombs and cypresses, the pillars and
obelisks, standing grimly up from the snow-clad graves; of the dusky
outlines of various distant buildings; of red lights streaming from
windows out upon the gloom; and he could see the pale silver crescent
of the new moon peeping sharply up above the black outline of the
Schloss of Frankenburg.

He heard the faint whisper of the ivy leaves on the old wall; but all
as one might do in a dream.'

He threw away the end of his cigar, and thought,

'I should not have been smoking when coming to meet _her_.'

No britzka or other carriage stood before the gate.  Heinrich was not
there as escort; neither was the old butler or any other servant
there in attendance.

So, as the evening was clear and fine, she must have come alone to
meet him, that they might have the joy of walking back to the Schloss
together!

He entered the church.  It was gaily decorated for the coming
Christmas-eve.

No one was in the church, and Charlie's heart began at once to sink,
when there was a sound behind him, and coming down two steps, from a
door that he had not observed before, was his own Ernestine.

'Carl!  Carl!  It is thee!  Thee, at last!' she exclaimed, in a
piercing voice, and, with innocent self-abandonment and a tenderness
that was irrepressible, but peculiarly her own, she flung herself
into his arms, as on that night in the boudoir.

She was dressed as if for a ball or some great festival; but Carl
remembered that this was Christmas-time, always a season of gaiety at
Frankenburg as elsewhere.

Her dress was white silk, covered with waves of the finest white
lace.  A great veil of the latter material enveloped her head and
shoulders.

She wanted but a white wreath to make her look like a lovely bride,
and Charlie's heart throbbed with pride and joy to think that she was
his own.

He thought she looked pale and tired.  It might be--nay, doubtless,
it must be--that the months of past anxiety had told upon her system
as on his own.

Yet her eyes had all the tender purity of an angel's in them, though
when she became excited there came over them a strange glitter, a
restless flashing, a sparkling animation, that contrasted strongly
with the languor of her form and actions; but happily there was no
fever flush on her cheek, which was pale--paler than of old, as
Charlie thought.

Long and silent was their embrace ere they spoke in broken accents of
all they had mutually undergone; and, while speaking, her head
nestling as it used to do on Charlie's neck, she shuddered sometimes,
for she seemed to be sorely chilled by the damp cold atmosphere of
the old church.

'Are all well at the Schloss?' asked Charlie suddenly, after a pause,
as the last evening's conversation recurred to him.

'All!  Thank Heaven!' replied Ernestine.

'And your father, the Herr Graf?'

'Well, too.'

Charlie was puzzled.  He must have been in a dream, or have
misunderstood the remarks of the two barons.

'Is Heinrich with the regiment?' he asked.

'No,' she replied, 'dear Heinrich is at the Schloss, and this morning
put your letter into my hand; and then, after, to tease or please me,
in my bosom.  See, it is there now!' she added, in the most engaging
manner.

'You found no difficulty in coming to meet me, dearest?'

'None.'

'How fortunate--how happy we are!'

'My poor Carl!'

'Why poor?  I feel to-night the happiest man in Germany.'

'I was resolved to meet you, at all risks, my darling.  A faith
plighted--a promise made is holy, Carl--holy to God and man.  I
promised to be here, Carl, in a dream that I had of you; and by a
strange chance I have been permitted to come--to be here, to see you,
feel your strong but tender arm round me once more.  Oh, Carl, kiss
me once again, as you did on that day in the Hoch Munster when first
you said you loved me.'

'Ernestine, what do you mean?' asked Charlie, eyeing her with some
anxiety, and impressed with a strange fear by the solemnity of her
manner.

'I belong no longer to myself.'

'To whom, then?  Heavens!' he added, starting, 'you have not become
the wife of that man!'

'Who?'

'Baron GrÃ¼nthal.'

'Oh, no; how could you think of such a thing for a moment, Carl?' she
said, with a bitter smile, while looking down and playing with a ring
he had given her in other days.

'Then to whom do you belong?' he asked, fondly.

'My love--to you!'

She put up her little face tenderly to his, and then looked away,
with the weary, wistful expression of those who have long lived in
some world of their own, and can never seem to see out beyond the
present.

'We were betrothed together for life and death, Carl.'

'Were--_are_, you mean, Ernestine.'

'Yes, beloved Carl; but time presses--alas!  I fear that I must leave
you now.'

'But to meet again----'

'Very soon.'

'I have brought these for you from Lorraine.  This is the bullet that
struck me down, and this cross is a trophy of the war.'

'How pretty--nay, it is beautiful and interesting, too,' she
exclaimed, with something of her old gleeful way, as he clasped round
her slender throat a gold necklet he had procured in Aix, and now the
white enamelled cross hung thereat.

She shuddered when she looked at the chassepot ball and took it in
her hand.

'And this actually pierced you, my Carl?'

'Nearly through and through, love.  For five days it was in
unpleasant proximity to my lungs.'

'It is indeed a relic,' said she, while placing it in the bosom of
her dress.

'So--so,' said she, sadly, disengaging herself from his arms, 'our
love has been sanctified by danger and death.'

'Great Heavens!' thought Carl, 'sorrow has turned her brain!'

'It has _not_,' she said; 'do not think so.'

'What is not?  I did not speak,' said Carl.

'No, but you thought; and I know what you thought, and there is no
living grace or glory like a love so sanctified as ours, Carl.'

He regarded her with a bewilderment not unmixed with alarm.

There was a strange wild and weird beauty in her pale face--a
radiance in her eyes, a brightness all over her such as Charlie had
never before witnessed.

Whence did it come?  From the altar-lights?

They were too dim.

What did it mean?  Was it her natural beauty only, magnified by the
force of his imagination, and enhanced by his great love for her?

Somehow Charlie was perplexed and startled by her, amid all the
transport and joy of the time.

Suddenly there was a sound of wheels and horses' hoofs without, then
of several feet ringing on the hard and frozen churchyard path.

Ernestine started, and exclaimed in a voice husky, as it seemed, with
alarm--

'They are coming--my father and that dreadful Baron!  I must leave
you, beloved Carl--but only for a time; we shall meet again where
even they can separate us no more!'

She turned, and flying like a phantom, hurried through the little
door by which she had entered the church; and Charlie Pierrepont,
feeling certain that their interview had been discovered--that they
had come in pursuit of her in ire and indignation, and that there
would be a scene which he was most anxious to avoid--looked hastily
round the little church for a place of concealment.

There was none; so he resolved to make the best of it, and turned to
the doorway just as the portly old Count of Frankenburg, the Baron
GrÃ¼nthal, limping as usual with gout, and Heinrich entered the church
together.




CONCLUSION.

They were all in evening costume--that sombre attire in which the
modern gentleman may attend a funeral by day, and a ball by night,
without change; and they all looked pale, harassed, and grave.

'Oh, Herr Graf von Frankenburg, if you have a human heart----'
Charlie was beginning, anxious to propitiate the father of her he
loved so dearly, when the Count, waving his hand, interrupted him,
and said:

'Herr Lieutenant, I can well afford to forgive the past now, and your
rash love for my daughter.'

'Herr Graf, I thank you--I thank you!' exclaimed Charlie, with warmth
and gratitude; for he expected high words, anger, and fierce
reproaches.

'Carl, my dear friend,' said Heinrich, taking his hand kindly in both
of his, while his eyes filled with genuine emotion, 'you here!--you
here after all!'

'You got my letter and gave it to her--to Ernestine?'

'To her--yes; but alas!  Carl, it came too late.'

'Too late!--too late!  How?'

'Do you not know?  have you not heard?  Poor Carl! poor Carl!' said
Heinrich, in a voice full of sympathy.

'What do you mean?' asked Charlie, in great perplexity.

'He means, Mein Herr,' said the Count, in a broken voice, 'that our
beloved Ernestine died at noon yesterday.'

Charlie passed a hand across his brow, and looked wildly in their
faces, as if doubting their sanity or his own.

'Died!' he repeated mechanically.

'It is incomprehensible your being here,' said the Count, in a still
more broken voice, and few could have seen that old man weeping
unmoved, 'as her last words were, "Meet me at Burtscheid--at
Burtscheid, dearest Carl."'

'And I _have_ met her, seen her, spoken with her not two minutes
since.'

'My poor friend,' said Heinrich, 'grief, or your wound, has turned
your brain.'

'What madness is this?' asked Charlie, with a kind of bitter laugh in
his voice, as he felt in no humour for jesting.  'Herr Graf, Herr
Baron, Heinrich, my friend, Ernestine has been here with me, in this
lonely church, for fully two hours!'

'And _spoken_ with you?' said the Count, in an excited tone.  'Oh, if
it should be that she still lives!'

'Lives!--great Heaven!  Herr Graf--she was here with me, and I gave
her a French cross with the bullet that wounded me.'

'He raves!' said the Baron Grunthal, with anger in his tone.

'She is there--in that room off the church.'

'In that room sure enough.  It is the Dead Chamber,' said the Count,
approaching the door.

'She fled there for concealment on hearing your approach.'

'Man,' said the old Count, pausing, 'are you not mad to tell me that
she is there now, and yet was here but a minute ago?'

'As I have Heaven to answer to--she was!'

'Follow me, then.'

On entering the room, Charlie Pierrepont reeled, and would have
fallen had not Heinrich supported him.

We scarcely know how to write of the episode that follows, and can
but tell the tale as it was told by those who were cognisant of it.

In a purple velvet coffin, mounted with silver, and supported on
trestles, the lid being open, lay Ernestine, dressed as we have
described her--dead, stone-dead, cold and pale as marble, her lips a
pale blue streak, her long eyelashes closed for ever.

Dead, beyond a doubt, was the girl he had clasped in his arms as a
living being, but a few minutes before living and full of volition
and life, love and energy; the lips he had kissed closed thus for
ever; the hands he had caressed, snow-white now, disposed upon her
bosom, the upper one holding the cross he had given her!

'Dead!  What miracle of heaven; what magic of hell is here!' he
exclaimed, as he staggered to the side of the coffin, pale as the
girl who lay in it, the bead-like drops oozing from his temples as he
grasped the locks above them.  'Speak! oh, speak, Heinrich!'

How terribly now came back to memory some of the strange things
Ernestine had said to him, and more than all, those dying words of
the French captain in the Chateau de Colombey, which sounded like
something between a prophecy and a curse!

'Compose yourself, Carl,' said Heinrich, full of pity.

'My letter to her--written after she was dead,' said Charles, in a
voice like a whisper--'she--she----'

'I placed it in her coffin ere she was brought here from the
Schloss,' said Heinrich, who was now weeping freely; 'it is there
now--and heavens, father! she _has_ round her neck the cross of which
Carl spoke.'

There are many things but imperfectly known in 'our philosophy,' and
certainly this seemed one of them.

'She died talking of you--not raving--the poor angel,' said the old
Count, as he bent fondly over the coffined girl, 'but smiling
sweetly, and saying earnestly, again and, again, that she would meet
you at Burtscheid.'

* * * * *

The gloomy half-lighted chamber in which this scene took place, and
where the dead girl lay, looking so sweetly placid in her coffin, was
one of those, where, in conformity with the police regulations of
Germany in general, the bodies of persons deceased are placed within
twelve hours after death--there to await interment.

In many places, more particularly at Frankfort, to guard against the
chances of burial in cases of suspended animation, the fingers of the
dead are placed in the loops of a bell-rope, attached to an alarm
clock, which is fixed in the apartment of the attendant appointed to
be on the watch.

The least pulsation in the body would give the alarm, when medical
aid would instantly be called in.

Ernestine had a watcher in an adjoining room! but that worthy was
found in the enjoyment of a profound slumber, and so had neither
heard nor seen anything.

This strange story found its way into the _Aix Gazette_ and the
_Extra Blatt_.

Some averred that Charlie Pierrepont, on discovering her body in the
chamber of Death, had gone mad and had imagined the whole interview
in the church; others, that it was really a case of suspended
animation, and that she had recovered for a time, and actually kept
her tryst; but the former idea was the predominant one.

Certain it is that for many weeks after the event Charlie seemed to
hover between life and death, sanity and insanity, at the Grand
Monarque; and when he rejoined the Thuringianas before the walls of
Paris, he had become so haggard, grey-haired, and old-looking, that
his former comrades scarcely recognised him, so much had he undergone
by a fever of the mind, rather than of the body.


When these dreadful events were soothed by time, though not forgotten
at Frankenburg, and when the summer flowers were blooming over
Charlie's grave--a grave which he found under the guns of Mont
Valerien--the young Graf Heinrich was married to his cousin Herminia
by the Herr Pastor Von PuffenvÃ¶rtz, in the church of Burtscheid,
when, as if no sorrow had preceded the ceremony, all indeed went
merrily as a 'marriage bell.'



THE END.

INTRODUCTION

THE FASCINATION OF THE GHOST STORY

ARTHUR B. REEVE


What is the fascination we feel for the mystery of the ghost story?

Is it of the same nature as the fascination which we feel for the
mystery of the detective story?

Of the latter fascination, the late Paul Armstrong used to say that it
was because we are all as full of crime as Sing Sing--only we don't
dare.

Thus, may I ask, are we not fascinated by the ghost story because, no
matter what may be the scientific or skeptical bent of our minds, in our
inmost souls, secretly perhaps, we are as full of superstition as an
obeah man--only we don't let it loose?

Who shall say that he is able to fling off lightly the inheritance of
countless ages of superstition? Is there not a streak of superstition in
us all? We laugh at the voodoo worshiper--then create our own hoodooes,
our pet obsessions.

It has been said that man is incurably religious, that if all religions
were blotted out, man would create a new religion.

Man is incurably fascinated by the mysterious. If all the ghost stories
of the ages were blotted out, man would invent new ones.

For, do we not all stand in awe of that which we cannot explain, of that
which, if it be not in our own experience, is certainly recorded in the
experience of others, of that of which we know and can know nothing?

Skeptical though one may be of the occult, he must needs be interested
in things that others believe to be objective--that certainly are
subjectively very real to them.

The ghost story is not born of science, nor even of super-science,
whatever that may be. It is not of science at all. It is of another
sphere, despite all that the psychic researchers have tried to
demonstrate.

There are in life two sorts of people who, for want of a better
classification, I may call the psychic and the non-psychic. If I ask the
psychic to close his eyes and I say to him, "Horse," he immediately
visualizes a horse. The other, non-psychic, does not. I rather incline
to believe that it is the former class who see ghosts, or rather some of
them. The latter do not--though they share interest in them.

The artists are of the visualizing class and, in our more modern times,
it is the psychic who think in motion pictures, or at least in a
succession of still pictures.

However we explain the ghostly and supernatural, whether we give it
objective or merely subjective reality, neither explanation prevents the
non-psychic from being intensely interested in the visions of the
psychic.

Thus I am convinced that if we were all quite honest with ourselves,
whether we believe in or do not believe in ghosts, at least we are all
deeply interested in them. There is in this interest something that
makes all the world akin.

Who does not feel a suppressed start at the creaking of furniture in the
dark of night? Who has not felt a shiver of goose flesh, controlled only
by an effort of will? Who, in the dark, has not had the feeling of some
_thing_ behind him--and, in spite of his conscious reasoning, turned to
look?

If there be any who has not, it may be that to him ghost stories have no
fascination. Let him at least, however, be honest.

To every human being mystery appeals, be it that of the crime cases on
which a large part of yellow journalism is founded, or be it in the
cases of Dupin, of Le Coq, of Sherlock Holmes, of Arsene Lupin, of Craig
Kennedy, or a host of others of our fiction mystery characters. The
appeal is in the mystery.

The detective's case is solved at the end, however. But even at the end
of a ghost story, the underlying mystery remains. In the ghost story, we
have the very quintessence of mystery.

Authors, publishers, editors, dramatists, writers of motion pictures
tell us that never before has there been such an intense and wide
interest in mystery stories as there is to-day. That in itself explains
the interest in the super-mystery story of the ghost and ghostly doings.

Another element of mystery lies in such stories. Deeper and further
back, is the supreme mystery of life--after death--what?

"Impossible," scorns the non-psychic as he listens to some ghost story.

To which, doggedly replies the mind of the opposite type, "Not so.
I believe _because_ it is impossible."

The uncanny, the unhealthy--as in the master of such writing,
Poe--fascinates. Whether we will or no, the imp of the perverse lures us
on.

That is why we read with enthralled interest these excursions into the
eerie unknown, perhaps reading on till the mystic hour of midnight
increases the creepy pleasure.

One might write a volume of analysis and appreciation of this aptly
balanced anthology of ghost stories assembled here after years of
reading and study by Mr. J.L. French.

Foremost among the impressions that a casual reader will derive is the
interesting fact, just as in detective mystery stories, so in ghost
stories, styles change. Each age, each period has the ghost story
peculiar to itself. To-day, there is a new style of ghost story
gradually evolving.

Once stories were of fairies, fays, trolls, the "little people," of
poltergiest and loup garou. Through various ages we have progressed to
the ghost story of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until to-day,
in the twentieth, we are seeing a modern style, which the new science is
modifying materially.

High among the stories in this volume, one must recognize the masterful
art of Algernon Blackwood's "The Woman's Ghost Story."

"I was interested in psychic things," says the woman as she starts to
tell her story simply, with a sweep toward the climax that has the ring
of the truth of fiction. Here perhaps we have the modern style of ghost
story at its best.

Times change as well as styles. "The Man Who Went Too Far" is of intense
interest as an attempt to bring into our own times an interpretation of
the symbolism underlying Greek mythology, applied to England of some
years ago.

To see Pan meant death. Hence in this story there is a philosophy of
Pan-theism--no "me," no "you," no "it." It is a mystical story, with a
storm scene in which is painted a picture that reminds one strongly of
"The Fall of the House of Ushur,"--with the frankly added words, "On him
were marks of hoofs of a monstrous goat that had leaped on
him,"--uncompromising mysticism.

Happy is the Kipling selection, "The Phantom 'Rickshaw," if only for
that obiter dictum of ghost-presence as Kipling explains about the rift
in the brain: "--and a little bit of the Dark World came through and
pressed him to death!"

Then there are the racial styles in ghost stories. The volume takes us
from the "Banshees and Other Death Warnings" of Ireland to a strange
example of Jewish mysticism in "The Silent Woman." Mr. French has been
very wide in his choice, giving us these as well as many examples from
the literature of England and France. Finally, he has compiled from the
newspapers, as typically American, many ghost stories of New York and
other parts of the country.

Strange that one should find humor in a subject so weird. Yet we find
it. Take, for instance, De Foe's old narrative, "The Apparition of Mrs.
Veal." It is a hoax, nothing more. Of our own times is Ellis Parker
Butler's "Dey Ain't No Ghosts," showing an example of the modern Negro's
racial heritage.

In our literature and on the stage, the very idea of a Darky and a
graveyard is mirth-provoking. Mr. Butler extracts some pithy philosophy
from his Darky boy: "I ain't skeered ob ghosts whut am, c'ase dey ain't
no ghosts, but I jes' feel kinder oneasy 'bout de ghosts whut ain't!"

Humor is succeeded by pathos. In "The Interval" we find a sympathetic
twist to the ghost story--an actual desire to meet the dead.

It is not, however, to be compared for interest to the story of sheer
terror, as in Bulwer-Lytton's "The Haunted and the Haunters," with the
flight of the servant in terror, the cowering of the dog against the
wall, the death of the dog, its neck actually broken by the terror, and
all that go to make an experience in a haunted house what it should be.

Thus, at last, we come to two of the stories that attempt to give a
scientific explanation, another phase of the modern style of ghost
story.

One of these, perhaps hardly modern as far as mere years are concerned,
is this same story of Bulwer, "The Haunted and the Haunters." Besides
being a rattling good old-fashioned tale of horror, it attempts a
new-fashioned scientific explanation. It is enough to read and re-read
it.

It is, however, the lamented Ambrose Bierce who has gone furthest in the
science and the philosophy of the matter, and in a very short story,
too, splendidly titled "The Damned Thing."

          "Incredible!" exclaims the coroner at the inquest.

          "That is nothing to you, sir," replies the
          newspaper man who relates the experience, and in
          these words expresses the true feeling about
          ghostly fiction, "that is nothing to you, if I
          also swear that it is true!"

But furthest of all in his scientific explanation--not scientifically
explaining away, but in explaining the way--goes Bierce as he outlines a
theory. From the diary of the murdered man he picks out the following
which we may treasure as a gem:

          "I am not mad. There are colors that we cannot
          see. And--God help me!--the Damned Thing is of
          such a color!"

This fascination of the ghost story--have I made it clear?

As I write, nearing midnight, the bookcase behind me cracks. I start and
turn. Nothing. There is a creak of a board in the hallway.

I know it is the cool night wind--the uneven contraction of materials
expanded in the heat of the day.

Yet--do I go into the darkness outside otherwise than alert?

It is this evolution of our sense of ghost terror--ages of it--that
fascinates us.

Can we, with a few generations of modernism behind us, throw it off with
all our science? And, if we did, should we not then succeed only in
abolishing the old-fashioned ghost story and creating a new, scientific
ghost story?

Scientific? Yes. But more,--something that has existed since the
beginnings of intelligence in the human race.

Perhaps, you critic, you say that the true ghost story originated in the
age of shadowy candle light and pine knot with their grotesqueries on
the walls and in the unpenetrated darkness, that the electric bulb and
the radiator have dispelled that very thing on which, for ages, the
ghost story has been built.

What? No ghost stories? Would you take away our supernatural fiction by
your paltry scientific explanation?

Still will we gather about the story teller--then lie awake o' nights,
seeing mocking figures, arms akimbo, defying all your science to crush
the ghost story.

THE APPARITION OF MRS. VEAL

BY DANIEL DE FOE


THE PREFACE

This relation is matter of fact, and attended with such circumstances,
as may induce any reasonable man to believe it. It was sent by a
gentleman, a justice of peace, at Maidstone, in Kent, and a very
intelligent person, to his friend in London, as it is here worded; which
discourse is attested by a very sober and understanding gentlewoman, a
kinswoman of the said gentleman's, who lives in Canterbury, within a few
doors of the house in which the within-named Mrs. Bargrave lives; who
believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit, as not to be put
upon by any fallacy; and who positively assured him that the whole
matter, as it is related and laid down, is really true; and what she
herself had in the same words, as near as may be, from Mrs. Bargrave's
own mouth, who, she knows, had no reason to invent and publish such a
story, or any design to forge and tell a lie, being a woman of much
honesty and virtue, and her whole life a course, as it were, of piety.
The use which we ought to make of it, is to consider, that there is a
life to come after this, and a just God, who will retribute to every one
according to the deeds done in the body; and therefore to reflect upon
our past course of life we have led in the world; that our time is short
and uncertain; and that if we would escape the punishment of the
ungodly, and receive the reward of the righteous, which is the laying
hold of eternal life, we ought, for the time to come, to return to God
by a speedy repentance, ceasing to do evil, and learning to do well: to
seek after God early, if happily He may be found of us, and lead such
lives for the future, as may be well pleasing in His sight.


A RELATION OF THE APPARITION OF MRS. VEAL

This thing is so rare in all its circumstances, and on so good
authority, that my reading and conversation has not given me anything
like it: it is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious inquirer.
Mrs. Bargrave is the person to whom Mrs. Veal appeared after her death;
she is my intimate friend, and I can avouch for her reputation, for
these last fifteen or sixteen years, on my own knowledge; and I can
confirm the good character she had from her youth, to the time of my
acquaintance. Though, since this relation, she is calumniated by some
people, that are friends to the brother of this Mrs. Veal, who appeared;
who think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection, and
endeavor what they can to blast Mrs. Bargrave's reputation, and to laugh
the story out of countenance. But by the circumstances thereof, and the
cheerful disposition of Mrs. Bargrave, notwithstanding the ill-usage of
a very wicked husband, there is not yet the least sign of dejection in
her face; nor did I ever hear her let fall a desponding or murmuring
expression; nay, not when actually under her husband's barbarity; which
I have been witness to, and several other persons of undoubted
reputation.

Now you must know, Mrs. Veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about thirty
years of age, and for some years last past had been troubled with fits;
which were perceived coming on her, by her going off from her discourse
very abruptly to some impertinence. She was maintained by an only
brother, and kept his house in Dover. She was a very pious woman, and
her brother a very sober man to all appearance; but now he does all he
can to null or quash the story. Mrs. Veal was intimately acquainted with
Mrs. Bargrave from her childhood. Mrs. Veal's circumstances were then
mean; her father did not take care of his children as he ought, so that
they were exposed to hardships; and Mrs. Bargrave, in those days, had as
unkind a father, though she wanted neither for food nor clothing, whilst
Mrs. Veal wanted for both; insomuch that she would often say, Mrs.
Bargrave, you are not only the best, but the only friend I have in the
world, and no circumstances of life shall ever dissolve my friendship.
They would often condole each other's adverse fortunes, and read
together Drelincourt upon Death, and other good books; and so, like two
Christian friends, they comforted each other under their sorrow.

Some time after, Mr. Veal's friends got him a place in the custom-house
at Dover, which occasioned Mrs. Veal, by little and little, to fall off
from her intimacy with Mrs. Bargrave, though there was never any such
thing as a quarrel; but an indifferency came on by degrees, till at last
Mrs. Bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half; though above a
twelvemonth of the time Mrs. Bargrave hath been absent from Dover, and
this last half year has been in Canterbury about two months of the time,
dwelling in a house of her own.

In this house, on the 8th of September, 1705, she was sitting alone in
the forenoon, thinking over her unfortunate life, and arguing herself
into a due resignation to providence, though her condition seemed hard.
And, said she, I have been provided for hitherto, and doubt not but I
shall be still; and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when
it is most fit for me: and then took up her sewing-work, which she had
no sooner done, but she hears a knocking at the door. She went to see
who was there, and this proved to be Mrs. Veal, her old friend, who was
in a riding-habit. At that moment of time the clock struck twelve at
noon.

Madam, says Mrs. Bargrave, I am surprised to see you, you have been so
long a stranger; but told her, she was glad to see her, and offered to
salute her; which Mrs. Veal complied with, till their lips almost
touched; and then Mrs. Veal drew her hand across her own eyes, and said,
I am not very well; and so waived it. She told Mrs. Bargrave, she was
going a journey, and had a great mind to see her first. But, says Mrs.
Bargrave, how came you to take a journey alone? I am amazed at it,
because I know you have a fond brother. Oh! says Mrs. Veal, I gave my
brother the slip, and came away because I had so great a desire to see
you before I took my journey. So Mrs. Bargrave went in with her, into
another room within the first, and Mrs. Veal sat her down in an
elbow-chair, in which Mrs. Bargrave was sitting when she heard Mrs. Veal
knock. Then says Mrs. Veal, My dear friend, I am come to renew our old
friendship again, and beg your pardon for my breach of it; and if you
can forgive me, you are the best of women. O, says Mrs. Bargrave, do not
mention such a thing; I have not had an uneasy thought about it; I can
easily forgive it. What did you think of me? said Mrs. Veal. Says Mrs.
Bargrave, I thought you were like the rest of the world, and that
prosperity had made you forget yourself and me. Then Mrs. Veal reminded
Mrs. Bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days,
and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of
their adversity; what books they read, and what comfort, in particular,
they received from Drelincourt's Book of Death, which was the best, she
said, on that subject ever written. She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, the
two Dutch books which were translated, written upon death, and several
others. But Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death,
and of the future state, of any who had handled that subject. Then she
asked Mrs. Bargrave, whether she had Drelincourt. She said, Yes. Says
Mrs. Veal, Fetch it. And so Mrs. Bargrave goes up stairs and brings it
down. Says Mrs. Veal, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, if the eyes of our faith were
as open as the eyes of our body, we should see numbers of angels about
us for our guard. The notions we have of heaven now, are nothing like
what it is, as Drelincourt says; therefore be comforted under your
afflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to
you; and that your afflictions are marks of God's favor; and when they
have done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from
you. And believe me, my dear friend, believe what I say to you, one
minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your
sufferings. For, I can never believe (and claps her hand upon her knee
with great earnestness, which indeed ran through most of her discourse),
that ever God will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted
state; but be assured, that your afflictions shall leave you, or you
them, in a short time. She spake in that pathetical and heavenly
manner, that Mrs. Bargrave wept several times, she was so deeply
affected with it.

Then Mrs. Veal mentioned Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick, at the end of which he
gives an account of the lives of the primitive Christians. Their pattern
she recommended to our imitation, and said, their conversation was not
like this of our age: For now, says she, there is nothing but frothy,
vain discourse, which is far different from theirs. Theirs was to
edification, and to build one another up in faith; so that they were not
as we are, nor are we as they were: but, says she, we ought to do as
they did. There was an hearty friendship among them; but where is it now
to be found? Says Mrs. Bargrave, It is hard indeed to find a true friend
in these days. Says Mrs. Veal, Mr. Norris has a fine copy of verses,
called Friendship in Perfection, which I wonderfully admire. Have you
seen the book? says Mrs. Veal. No, says Mrs. Bargrave, but I have the
verses of my own writing out. Have you? says Mrs. Veal, then fetch them.
Which she did from above stairs, and offered them to Mrs. Veal to read,
who refused, and waived the thing, saying, holding down her head would
make it ache; and then desired Mrs. Bargrave to read them to her, which
she did. As they were admiring friendship, Mrs. Veal said, Dear Mrs.
Bargrave, I shall love you for ever. In these verses there is twice used
the word Elysian. Ah! says Mrs. Veal, these poets have such names for
heaven. She would often draw her hands across her own eyes, and say,
Mrs. Bargrave, do not you think I am mightily impaired by my fits? No,
says Mrs. Bargrave, I think you look as well as ever I knew you. After
all this discourse, which the apparition put in much finer words than
Mrs. Bargrave said she could pretend to, and as much more than she can
remember, (for it cannot be thought, that an hour and three quarters'
conversation could all be retained, though the main of it she thinks she
does,) she said to Mrs. Bargrave, she would have her write a letter to
her brother, and tell him, she would have him give rings to such and
such; and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet, and that she
would have two broad pieces given to her cousin Watson.

Talking at this rate, Mrs. Bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon
her, and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees, to keep her
from falling to the ground, if her fits should occasion it: for the
elbow-chair, she thought, would keep her from falling on either side.
And to divert Mrs. Veal, as she thought, took hold of her gown-sleeve
several times, and commended it. Mrs. Veal told her, it was a scowered
silk, and newly made up. But for all this, Mrs. Veal persisted in her
request, and told Mrs. Bargrave, she must not deny her: and she would
have her tell her brother all their conversation, when she had
opportunity. Dear Mrs. Veal, says Mrs. Bargrave, this seems so
impertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a
mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman? Why,
says Mrs. Bargrave, it is much better, methinks, to do it yourself. No,
says Mrs. Veal, though it seems impertinent to you now, you will see
more reason for it hereafter. Mrs. Bargrave then, to satisfy her
importunity, was going to fetch a pen and ink; but Mrs. Veal said, Let
it alone now, but do it when I am gone; but you must be sure to do it:
which was one of the last things she enjoined her at parting; and so she
promised her.

Then Mrs. Veal asked for Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; she said, she was not
at home: But if you have a mind to see her, says Mrs. Bargrave, I'll
send for her. Do, says Mrs. Veal. On which she left her, and went to a
neighbor's to seek for her; and by the time Mrs. Bargrave was returning,
Mrs. Veal was got without the door in the street, in the face of the
beast-market, on a Saturday, which is market-day, and stood ready to
part, as soon as Mrs. Bargrave came to her. She asked her, why she was
in such haste. She said she must be going, though perhaps she might not
go her journey till Monday; and told Mrs. Bargrave, she hoped she should
see her again at her cousin Watson's, before she went whither she was
going. Then she said, she would take her leave of her, and walked from
Mrs. Bargrave in her view, till a turning interrupted the sight of her,
which was three quarters after one in the afternoon.

Mrs. Veal died the 7th of September, at twelve o'clock at noon of her
fits, and had not above four hours' senses before her death, in which
time she received the sacrament. The next day after Mrs. Veal's
appearing, being Sunday, Mrs. Bargrave was mightily indisposed with a
cold, and a sore throat, that she could not go out that day; but on
Monday morning she sent a person to Captain Watson's, to know if Mrs.
Veal was there. They wondered at Mrs. Bargrave's inquiry; and sent her
word, that she was not there, nor was expected. At this answer Mrs.
Bargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name, or made some
blunder. And though she was ill, she put on her hood, and went herself
to Captain Watson's though she knew none of the family, to see if Mrs.
Veal was there or not. They said, they wondered at her asking, for that
she had not been in town; they were sure, if she had, she would have
been there. Says Mrs. Bargrave, I am sure she was with me on Saturday
almost two hours. They said, it was impossible; for they must have seen
her if she had. In comes Captain Watson, while they were in dispute, and
said, that Mrs. Veal was certainly dead, and her escutcheons were
making. This strangely surprised Mrs. Bargrave, when she sent to the
person immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. Then she
related the whole story to Captain Watson's family, and what gown she
had on, and how striped; and that Mrs. Veal told her, it was scowered.
Then Mrs. Watson cried out, You have seen her indeed, for none knew, but
Mrs. Veal and myself, that the gown was scowered. And Mrs. Watson owned,
that she described the gown exactly: For, said she, I helped her to make
it up. This Mrs. Watson blazed all about the town, and avouched the
demonstration of the truth of Mrs. Bargrave's seeing Mrs. Veal's
apparition. And Captain Watson carried two gentlemen immediately to Mrs.
Bargrave's house, to hear the relation of her own mouth. And when it
spread so fast, that gentlemen and persons of quality, the judicious and
skeptical part of the world, flocked in upon her, it at last became such
a task, that she was forced to go out of the way. For they were, in
general, extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing, and plainly saw
that Mrs. Bargrave was no hypochondraic; for she always appears with
such a cheerful air, and pleasing mien, that she has gained the favor
and esteem of all the gentry; and it is thought a great favor, if they
can but get the relation from her own mouth. I should have told you
before, that Mrs. Veal told Mrs. Bargrave, that her sister and
brother-in-law were just come down from London to see her. Says Mrs.
Bargrave, How came you to order matters so strangely? It could not be
helped, says Mrs. Veal. And her brother and sister did come to see her,
and entered the town of Dover just as Mrs. Veal was expiring. Mrs.
Bargrave, asked her, whether she would drink some tea. Says Mrs. Veal,
I do not care if I do; but I'll warrant you, this mad fellow (meaning
Mrs. Bargrave's husband) has broke all your trinkets. But, says Mrs.
Bargrave, I'll get something to drink in for all that; but Mrs. Veal
waived it, and said, It is no matter, let it alone; and so it passed.

All the time I sat with Mrs. Bargrave, which was some hours, she
recollected fresh sayings of Mrs. Veal. And one material thing more she
told Mrs. Bargrave, that old Mr. Breton allowed Mrs. Veal ten pounds a
year; which was a secret, and unknown to Mrs. Bargrave, till Mrs. Veal
told it her.

Mrs. Bargrave never varies in her story; which puzzles those who doubt
of the truth, or are unwilling to believe it. A servant in the
neighbor's yard, adjoining to Mrs. Bargrave's house, heard her talking
to somebody an hour of the time Mrs. Veal was with her. Mrs. Bargrave
went out to her next neighbor's the very moment she parted with Mrs.
Veal, and told her what ravishing conversation she had with an old
friend, and told the whole of it. Drelincourt's Book of Death is, since
this happened, bought up strangely. And it is to be observed, that
notwithstanding all the trouble and fatigue Mrs. Bargrave has undergone
upon this account, she never took the value of a farthing, nor suffered
her daughter to take anything of anybody, and therefore can have no
interest in telling the story.

But Mr. Veal does what he can to stifle the matter, and said, he would
see Mrs. Bargrave; but yet it is certain matter of fact that he has been
at Captain Watson's since the death of his sister, and yet never went
near Mrs. Bargrave; and some of his friends report her to be a liar,
and that she knew of Mr. Breton's ten pounds a year. But the person who
pretends to say so, has the reputation of a notorious liar, among
persons whom I know to be of undoubted credit. Now Mr. Veal is more of a
gentleman than to say she lies; but says, a bad husband has crazed her.
But she needs only present herself, and it will effectually confute that
pretense. Mr. Veal says, he asked his sister on her death-bed, whether
she had a mind to dispose of anything? And she said, No. Now, the things
which Mrs. Veal's apparition would have disposed of, were so trifling,
and nothing of justice aimed at in their disposal, that the design of it
appears to me to be only in order to make Mrs. Bargrave so to
demonstrate the truth of her appearance, as to satisfy the world of the
reality thereof, as to what she had seen and heard; and to secure her
reputation among the reasonable and understanding part of mankind. And
then again, Mr. Veal owns, that there was a purse of gold; but it was
not found in her cabinet, but in a comb-box. This looks improbable; for
that Mrs. Watson owned, that Mrs. Veal was so very careful of the key of
the cabinet, that she would trust nobody with it. And if so, no doubt
she would not trust her gold out of it. And Mrs. Veal's often drawing
her hand over her eyes, and asking Mrs. Bargrave whether her fits had
not impaired her, looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind Mrs.
Bargrave of her fits, to prepare her not to think it strange that she
should put her upon writing to her brother to dispose of rings and gold,
which looked so much like a dying person's request; and it took
accordingly with Mrs. Bargrave, as the effects of her fits coming upon
her; and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her, and
care of her, that she should not be affrighted; which indeed appears in
her whole management, particularly in her coming to her in the day-time,
waiving the salutation, and when she was alone; and then the manner of
her parting, to prevent a second attempt to salute her.

Now, why Mr. Veal should think this relation a reflection, as it is
plain he does, by his endeavoring to stifle it, I cannot imagine;
because the generality believe her to be a good spirit, her discourse
was so heavenly. Her two great errands were to comfort Mrs. Bargrave in
her affliction, and to ask her forgiveness for the breach of friendship,
and with a pious discourse to encourage her. So that, after all, to
suppose that Mrs. Bargrave could hatch such an invention as this from
Friday noon till Saturday noon, supposing that she knew of Mrs. Veal's
death the very first moment, without jumbling circumstances, and without
any interest too; she must be more witty, fortunate, and wicked too,
than any indifferent person, I dare say, will allow. I asked Mrs.
Bargrave several times, if she was sure she felt the gown? She answered
modestly, If my senses be to be relied on, I am sure of it. I asked her,
if she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee? She said,
she did not remember she did; but said she appeared to be as much a
substance as I did, who talked with her. And I may, said she, be as soon
persuaded, that your apparition is talking to me now, as that I did not
really see her: for I was under no manner of fear, and received her as a
friend, and parted with her as such. I would not, says she, give one
farthing to make any one believe it: I have no interest in it; nothing
but trouble is entailed upon me for a long time, for aught I know; and
had it not come to light by accident, it would never have been made
public. But now, she says, she will make her own private use of it, and
keep herself out of the way as much as she can; and so she has done
since. She says, She had a gentleman who came thirty miles to her to
hear the relation; and that she had told it to a room full of people at
a time. Several particular gentlemen have had the story from Mrs.
Bargrave's own mouth.

This thing has very much affected me, and I am as well satisfied, as I
am of the best-grounded matter of fact. And why we should dispute matter
of fact, because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain
or demonstrative notions, seems strange to me. Mrs. Bargrave's authority
and sincerity alone, would have been undoubted in any other case.


TO THE READER

The origin of the foregoing curious story seems to have been as
follows:--

An adventurous bookseller had ventured to print a considerable edition
of a work by the Reverend Charles Drelincourt, minister of the Calvinist
church in Paris, and translated by M. D'Assigny, under the title of "The
Christian's Defense against the Fear of Death, with several directions
how to prepare ourselves to die well." But however certain the prospect
of death, it is not so agreeable (unfortunately) as to invite the eager
contemplation of the public; and Drelincourt's book, being neglected,
lay a dead stock on the hands of the publisher. In this emergency, he
applied to De Foe to assist him (by dint of such means as were then, as
well as now, pretty well understood in the literary world) in rescuing
the unfortunate book from the literary death to which general neglect
seemed about to consign it.

De Foe's genius and audacity devised a plan which, for assurance and
ingenuity, defied even the powers of Mr. Puff in the _Critic_: for who
but himself would have thought of summoning up a ghost from the grave to
bear witness in favor of a halting body of divinity? There is a
matter-of-fact, business-like style in the whole account of the
transaction, which bespeaks ineffable powers of self-possession. The
narrative is drawn up "by a gentleman, a _Justice of Peace_ at
Maidstone, in Kent, a very intelligent person." And, moreover, "the
discourse is attested by a very sober gentlewoman, who lives in
Canterbury, within a few doors of the house in which Mrs. Bargrave
lives." The Justice believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a
spirit, as not to be put upon by any fallacy--and the kinswoman
positively assures the Justice, "that the whole matter, as it is related
and laid down, is really true, and what she herself heard, as near as
may be, from Mrs. Bargrave's own mouth, who, she knows, had no reason to
invent or publish such a story, or any design to forge and tell a lie,
being a woman of so much honesty and virtue, and her whole life a
course, as it were, of piety." Skepticism itself could not resist this
triple court of evidence so artfully combined, the Justice attesting
for the discerning spirit of the sober and understanding gentlewoman his
kinswoman, and his kinswoman becoming bail for the veracity of Mrs.
Bargrave. And here, gentle reader, admire the simplicity of those days.
Had Mrs. Veal's visit to her friend happened in our time, the conductors
of the daily press would have given the word, and seven gentlemen unto
the said press belonging, would, with an obedient start, have made off
for Kingston, for Canterbury, for Dover,--for Kamchatka if
necessary,--to pose the Justice, cross-examine Mrs. Bargrave, confront
the sober and understanding kinswoman, and dig Mrs. Veal up from her
grave, rather than not get to the bottom of the story. But in our time
we doubt and scrutinize; our ancestors wondered and believed.

Before the story is commenced, the understanding gentlewoman (not the
Justice of Peace), who is the reporter, takes some pains to repel the
objections made against the story by some of the friends of Mrs. Veal's
brother, who consider the marvel as an aspersion on their family, and do
what they can to laugh it out of countenance. Indeed, it is allowed,
with admirable impartiality, that Mr. Veal is too much of a gentleman to
suppose Mrs. Bargrave invented the story--scandal itself could scarce
have supposed that--although one notorious liar, who is chastised
towards the conclusion of the story, ventures to throw out such an
insinuation. No reasonable or respectable person, however, could be
found to countenance the suspicion, and Mr. Veal himself opined that
Mrs. Bargrave had been driven crazy by a cruel husband, and dreamed the
whole story of the apparition. Now all this is sufficiently artful. To
have vouched the fact as universally known, and believed by every one,
_nem. con._, would not have been half so satisfactory to a skeptic as to
allow fairly that the narrative had been impugned, and hint at the
character of one of those skeptics, and the motives of another, as
sufficient to account for their want of belief. Now to the fact itself.

Mrs. Bargrave and Mrs. Veal had been friends in youth, and had protested
their attachment should last as long as they lived; but when Mrs. Veal's
brother obtained an office in the customs at Dover, some cessation of
their intimacy ensued, "though without any positive quarrel." Mrs.
Bargrave had removed to Canterbury, and was residing in a house of her
own, when she was suddenly interrupted by a visit from Mrs. Veal, as she
was sitting in deep contemplation of certain distresses of her own. The
visitor was in a riding-habit, and announced herself as prepared for a
distant journey (which seems to intimate that spirits have a
considerable distance to go before they arrive at their appointed
station, and that the females at least put on a _habit_ for the
occasion). The spirit, for such was the seeming Mrs. Veal, continued to
waive the ceremony of salutation, both in going and coming, which will
remind the reader of a ghostly lover's reply to his mistress in the fine
old Scottish ballad:--

          Why should I come within thy bower?
            I am no earthly man;
          And should I kiss thy rosy lips,
            Thy days would not be lang.

They then began to talk in the homely style of middle-aged ladies, and
Mrs. Veal proses concerning the conversations they had formerly held,
and the books they had read together. Her very recent experience
probably led Mrs. Veal to talk of death, and the books written on the
subject, and she pronounced _ex cathedrÃ¡_, as a dead person was best
entitled to do, that "Drelincourt's book on Death was the best book on
the subject ever written." She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, two Dutch
books which had been translated, and several others; but Drelincourt,
she said, had the clearest notions of death and the future state of any
who had handled that subject. She then asked for the work [we marvel the
edition and impress had not been mentioned] and lectured on it with
great eloquence and affection. Dr. Kenrick's _Ascetick_ was also
mentioned with approbation by this critical specter [the Doctor's work
was no doubt a tenant of the shelf in some favorite publisher's shop];
and Mr. Norris's _Poem on Friendship_, a work, which I doubt, though
honored with a ghost's approbation, we may now seek for as vainly as
Correlli tormented his memory to recover the sonata which the devil
played to him in a dream. Presently after, from former habits we may
suppose, the guest desires a cup of tea; but, bethinking herself of her
new character, escapes from her own proposal by recollecting that Mr.
Bargrave was in the habit of breaking his wife's china. It would have
been indeed strangely out of character if the spirit had lunched, or
breakfasted upon tea and toast. Such a consummation would have sounded
as ridiculous as if the statue of the commander in _Don Juan_ had not
only accepted of the invitation of the libertine to supper, but had also
committed a beefsteak to his flinty jaws and stomach of adamant. A
little more conversation ensued of a less serious nature, and tending to
show that even the passage from life to death leaves the female anxiety
about person and dress somewhat alive. The ghost asked Mrs. Bargrave
whether she did not think her very much altered, and Mrs. Bargrave of
course complimented her on her good looks. Mrs. Bargrave also admired
the gown which Mrs. Veal wore, and as a mark of her perfectly restored
confidence, the spirit led her into the important secret, that it was a
_scoured silk_, and lately made up. She informed her also of another
secret, namely, that one Mr. Breton had allowed her ten pounds a year;
and, lastly, she requested that Mrs. Bargrave would write to her
brother, and tell him how to distribute her mourning rings, and
mentioned there was a purse of gold in her cabinet. She expressed some
wish to see Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; but when that good lady went to
the next door to seek her, she found on her return the guest leaving the
house. She had got without the door, in the street, in the face of the
beast market, on a Saturday, which is market day, and stood ready to
part. She said she must be going, as she had to call upon her cousin
Watson (this appears to be a _gratis dictum_ on the part of the ghost)
and, maintaining the character of mortality to the last, she quietly
turned the corner, and walked out of sight.

Then came the news of Mrs. Veal's having died the day before at noon.
Says Mrs. Bargrave, "I am sure she was with me on Saturday almost two
hours." And in comes Captain Watson, and says Mrs. Veal was certainly
dead. And then come all the pieces of evidence, and especially the
striped silk gown. Then Mrs. Watson cried out, "You have seen her
indeed, for none knew but Mrs. Veal and I that that gown was scoured";
and she cried that the gown was described exactly, for, said she, "I
helped her to make it up." And next we have the silly attempts made to
discredit the history. Even Mr. Veal, her brother, was obliged to allow
that the gold was found, but with a difference, and pretended it was not
found in a cabinet, but elsewhere; and, in short, we have all the gossip
of _says I_, and _thinks I_, and _says she_, and _thinks she_, which
disputed matters usually excite in a country town.

When we have thus turned the tale, the seam without, it may be thought
too ridiculous to have attracted notice. But whoever will read it as
told by De Foe himself, will agree that, could the thing have happened
in reality, so it would have been told. The sobering the whole
supernatural visit into the language of the middle or low life, gives it
an air of probability even in its absurdity. The ghost of an exciseman's
housekeeper, and a seamstress, were not to converse like Brutus with his
Evil Genius. And the circumstances of scoured silks, broken tea-china,
and such like, while they are the natural topics of such persons'
conversation, would, one might have thought, be the last which an
inventor would have introduced into a pretended narrative betwixt the
dead and living. In short, the whole is so distinctly circumstantial,
that, were it not for the impossibility, or extreme improbability at
least, of such an occurrence, the evidence could not but support the
story.

The effect was most wonderful. _Drelincourt upon Death_, attested by one
who could speak from experience, took an unequaled run. The copies had
hung on the bookseller's hands as heavy as a pile of lead bullets. They
now traversed the town in every direction, like the same balls
discharged from a field-piece. In short, the object of Mrs. Veal's
apparition was perfectly attained.--[See The Miscellaneous Prose Works
of Sir Walter Scott, Bart., vol. iv. p. 305, ed. 1827.]




CANON ALBERIC'S SCRAP-BOOK

BY MONTAGUE RHODES JAMES


St. Bertrand de Comminges is a decayed town on the spurs of the
Pyrenees, not very far from Toulouse, and still nearer to
BagnÃ¨res-de-Luchon. It was the site of a bishopric until the Revolution,
and has a cathedral which is visited by a certain number of tourists. In
the spring of 1883 an Englishman arrived at this old-world place--I can
hardly dignify it with the name of city, for there are not a thousand
inhabitants. He was a Cambridge man, who had come specially from
Toulouse to see St. Bertrand's Church, and had left two friends, who
were less keen archÃ¦ologists than himself, in their hotel at Toulouse,
under promise to join him on the following morning. Half an hour at the
church would satisfy _them_, and all three could then pursue their
journey in the direction of Auch. But our Englishman had come early on
the day in question, and proposed to himself to fill a note-book and to
use several dozens of plates in the process of describing and
photographing every corner of the wonderful church that dominates the
little hill of Comminges. In order to carry out this design
satisfactorily, it was necessary to monopolize the verger of the church
for the day. The verger or sacristan (I prefer the latter appellation,
inaccurate as it may be) was accordingly sent for by the somewhat
brusque lady who keeps the inn of the Chapeau Rouge; and when he came,
the Englishman found him an unexpectedly interesting object of study. It
was not in the personal appearance of the little, dry, wizened old man
that the interest lay, for he was precisely like dozens of other
church-guardians in France, but in a curious furtive, or rather hunted
and oppressed, air which he had. He was perpetually half glancing behind
him; the muscles of his back and shoulders seemed to be hunched in a
continual nervous contraction, as if he were expecting every moment to
find himself in the clutch of an enemy. The Englishman hardly knew
whether to put him down as a man haunted by a fixed delusion, or as one
oppressed by a guilty conscience, or as an unbearably henpecked husband.
The probabilities, when reckoned up, certainly pointed to the last idea;
but, still, the impression conveyed was that of a more formidable
persecutor even than a termagant wife.

However, the Englishman (let us call him Dennistoun) was soon too deep
in his note-book and too busy with his camera to give more than an
occasional glance to the sacristan. Whenever he did look at him, he
found him at no great distance, either huddling himself back against the
wall or crouching in one of the gorgeous stalls. Dennistoun became
rather fidgety after a time. Mingled suspicions that he was keeping the
old man from his _dÃ©jeuner_, that he was regarded as likely to make away
with St. Bertrand's ivory crozier, or with the dusty stuffed crocodile
that hangs over the font, began to torment him.

"Won't you go home?" he said at last; "I'm quite well able to finish my
notes alone; you can lock me in if you like. I shall want at least two
hours more here, and it must be cold for you, isn't it?"

"Good heavens!" said the little man, whom the suggestion seemed to throw
into a state of unaccountable terror, "such a thing cannot be thought of
for a moment. Leave monsieur alone in the church? No, no; two hours,
three hours, all will be the same to me. I have breakfasted, I am not at
all cold, with many thanks to monsieur."

"Very well, my little man," quoth Dennistoun to himself: "you have been
warned, and you must take the consequences."

Before the expiration of the two hours, the stalls, the enormous
dilapidated organ, the choir-screen of Bishop John de MaulÃ©on, the
remnants of glass and tapestry, and the objects in the treasure-chamber,
had been well and truly examined; the sacristan still keeping at
Dennistoun's heels, and every now and then whipping round as if he had
been stung, when one or other of the strange noises that trouble a
large empty building fell on his ear. Curious noises they were
sometimes.

"Once," Dennistoun said to me, "I could have sworn I heard a thin
metallic voice laughing high up in the tower. I darted an inquiring
glance at my sacristan. He was white to the lips. 'It is he--that is--it
is no one; the door is locked,' was all he said, and we looked at each
other for a full minute."

Another little incident puzzled Dennistoun a good deal. He was examining
a large dark picture that hangs behind the altar, one of a series
illustrating the miracles of St. Bertrand. The composition of the
picture is well-nigh indecipherable, but there is a Latin legend below,
which runs thus:

          "Qualiter S. Bertrandus liberavit hominem quem
          diabolus diu volebat strangulare." (How St.
          Bertrand delivered a man whom the Devil long
          sought to strangle.)

Dennistoun was turning to the sacristan with a smile and a jocular
remark of some sort on his lips, but he was confounded to see the old
man on his knees, gazing at the picture with the eye of a suppliant in
agony, his hands tightly clasped, and a rain of tears on his cheeks.
Dennistoun naturally pretended to have noticed nothing, but the question
would not away from him, "Why should a daub of this kind affect any one
so strongly?" He seemed to himself to be getting some sort of clue to
the reason of the strange look that had been puzzling him all the day:
the man must be monomaniac; but what was his monomania?

It was nearly five o'clock; the short day was drawing in, and the church
began to fill with shadows, while the curious noises--the muffled
footfalls and distant talking voices that had been perceptible all
day--seemed, no doubt because of the fading light and the consequently
quickened sense of hearing, to become more frequent and insistent.

The sacristan began for the first time to show signs of hurry and
impatience. He heaved a sigh of relief when camera and note-book were
finally packed up and stowed away, and hurriedly beckoned Dennistoun to
the western door of the church, under the tower. It was time to ring the
Angelus. A few pulls at the reluctant rope, and the great bell
Bertrande, high in the tower, began to speak, and swung her voice up
among the pines and down to the valleys, loud with mountain-streams,
calling the dwellers on those lonely hills to remember and repeat the
salutation of the angel to her whom he called Blessed among women. With
that a profound quiet seemed to fall for the first time that day upon
the little town, and Dennistoun and the sacristan went out of the
church.

On the doorstep they fell into conversation.

"Monsieur seemed to interest himself in the old choir-books in the
sacristy."

"Undoubtedly. I was going to ask you if there were a library in the
town."

"No, monsieur; perhaps there used to be one belonging to the Chapter,
but it is now such a small place----" Here came a strange pause of
irresolution, as it seemed; then, with a sort of plunge, he went on:
"But if monsieur is _amateur des vieux livres_, I have at home something
that might interest him. It is not a hundred yards."

At once all Dennistoun's cherished dreams of finding priceless
manuscripts in untrodden corners of France flashed up, to die down again
the next moment. It was probably a stupid missal of Plantin's printing,
about 1580. Where was the likelihood that a place so near Toulouse would
not have been ransacked long ago by collectors? However, it would be
foolish not to go; he would reproach himself for ever after if he
refused. So they set off. On the way the curious irresolution and sudden
determination of the sacristan recurred to Dennistoun, and he wondered
in a shamefaced way whether he was being decoyed into some purlieu to be
made away with as a supposed rich Englishman. He contrived, therefore,
to begin talking with his guide, and to drag in, in a rather clumsy
fashion, the fact that he expected two friends to join him early the
next morning. To his surprise, the announcement seemed to relieve the
sacristan at once of some of the anxiety that oppressed him.

"That is well," he said quite brightly--"that is very well. Monsieur
will travel in company with his friends; they will be always near him.
It is a good thing to travel thus in company--sometimes."

The last word appeared to be added as an afterthought, and to bring with
it a relapse into gloom for the poor little man.

They were soon at the house, which was one rather larger than its
neighbors, stone-built, with a shield carved over the door, the shield
of Alberic de MaulÃ©on, a collateral descendant, Dennistoun tells me, of
Bishop John de MaulÃ©on. This Alberic was a Canon of Comminges from 1680
to 1701. The upper windows of the mansion were boarded up, and the whole
place bore, as does the rest of Comminges, the aspect of decaying age.

Arrived on his doorstep, the sacristan paused a moment.

"Perhaps," he said, "perhaps, after all, monsieur has not the time?"

"Not at all--lots of time--nothing to do till to-morrow. Let us see what
it is you have got."

The door was opened at this point, and a face looked out, a face far
younger than the sacristan's, but bearing something of the same
distressing look: only here it seemed to be the mark, not so much of
fear for personal safety as of acute anxiety on behalf of another.
Plainly, the owner of the face was the sacristan's daughter; and, but
for the expression I have described, she was a handsome girl enough. She
brightened up considerably on seeing her father accompanied by an
able-bodied stranger. A few remarks passed between father and daughter,
of which Dennistoun only caught these words, said by the sacristan, "He
was laughing in the church," words which were answered only by a look of
terror from the girl.

But in another minute they were in the sitting-room of the house, a
small, high chamber with a stone floor, full of moving shadows cast by a
wood-fire that flickered on a great hearth. Something of the character
of an oratory was imparted to it by a tall crucifix, which reached
almost to the ceiling on one side; the figure was painted of the natural
colors, the cross was black. Under this stood a chest of some age and
solidity, and when a lamp had been brought, and chairs set, the
sacristan went to this chest, and produced therefrom, with growing
excitement and nervousness, as Dennistoun thought, a large book wrapped
in a white cloth, on which cloth a cross was rudely embroidered in red
thread. Even before the wrapping had been removed, Dennistoun began to
be interested by the size and shape of the volume. "Too large for a
missal," he thought, "and not the shape of an antiphoner; perhaps it may
be something good, after all." The next moment the book was open, and
Dennistoun felt that he had at last lit upon something better than good.
Before him lay a large folio, bound, perhaps, late in the seventeenth
century, with the arms of Canon Alberic de MaulÃ©on stamped in gold on
the sides. There may have been a hundred and fifty leaves of paper in
the book, and on almost every one of them was fastened a leaf from an
illuminated manuscript. Such a collection Dennistoun had hardly dreamed
of in his wildest moments. Here were ten leaves from a copy of Genesis,
illustrated with pictures, which could not be later than 700 A.D.
Further on was a complete set of pictures from a psalter, of English
execution, of the very finest kind that the thirteenth century could
produce; and, perhaps best of all, there were twenty leaves of uncial
writing in Latin, which, as a few words seen here and there told him at
once, must belong to some very early unknown patristic treatise. Could
it possibly be a fragment of the copy of Papias "On the Words of Our
Lord," which was known to have existed as late as the twelfth century at
NÃ®mes?[A] In any case, his mind was made up; that book must return to
Cambridge with him, even if he had to draw the whole of his balance from
the bank and stay at St. Bertrand till the money came. He glanced up at
the sacristan to see if his face yielded any hint that the book was for
sale. The sacristan was pale, and his lips were working.

"If monsieur will turn on to the end," he said.

So monsieur turned on, meeting new treasures at every rise of a leaf;
and at the end of the book he came upon two sheets of paper, of much
more recent date than anything he had yet seen, which puzzled him
considerably. They must be contemporary, he decided, with the
unprincipled Canon Alberic, who had doubtless plundered the Chapter
library of St. Bertrand to form this priceless scrapbook. On the first
of the paper sheets was a plan, carefully drawn and instantly
recognizable by a person who knew the ground, of the south aisle and
cloisters of St. Bertrand's. There were curious signs looking like
planetary symbols, and a few Hebrew words in the corners; and in the
northwest angle of the cloister was a cross drawn in gold paint. Below
the plan were some lines of writing in Latin, which ran thus:

          "Responsa 12^{mi} Dec. 1694. Interrogatum est:
          Inveniamne? Responsum est: Invenies. Fiamne dives?
          Fies. Vivamne invidendus? Vives. Moriarne in lecto
          meo? Ita." (Answers of the 12th of December, 1694.
          It was asked: Shall I find it? Answer: Thou shalt.
          Shall I become rich? Thou wilt. Shall I live an
          object of envy? Thou wilt. Shall I die in my bed?
          Thou wilt.)

"A good specimen of the treasure-hunter's record--quite reminds one of
Mr. Minor-Canon Quatremain in 'Old St. Paul's,'" was Dennistoun's
comment, and he turned the leaf.

What he then saw impressed him, as he has often told me, more than he
could have conceived any drawing or picture capable of impressing him.
And, though the drawing he saw is no longer in existence, there is a
photograph of it (which I possess) which fully bears out that statement.
The picture in question was a sepia drawing at the end of the
seventeenth century, representing, one would say at first sight, a
Biblical scene; for the architecture (the picture represented an
interior) and the figures had that semi-classical flavor about them
which the artists of two hundred years ago thought appropriate to
illustrations of the Bible. On the right was a king on his throne, the
throne elevated on twelve steps, a canopy overhead, soldiers on either
side--evidently King Solomon. He was bending forward with outstretched
scepter, in attitude of command; his face expressed horror and disgust,
yet there was in it also the mark of imperious command and confident
power. The left half of the picture was the strangest, however. The
interest plainly centered there. On the pavement before the throne were
grouped four soldiers, surrounding a crouching figure which must be
described in a moment. A fifth soldier lay dead on the pavement, his
neck distorted, and his eyeballs starting from his head. The four
surrounding guards were looking at the King. In their faces the
sentiment of horror was intensified; they seemed, in fact, only
restrained from flight by their implicit trust in their master. All this
terror was plainly excited by the being that crouched in their midst.
I entirely despair of conveying by any words the impression which this
figure makes upon any one who looks at it. I recollect once showing the
photograph of the drawing to a lecturer on morphology--a person of, I
was going to say, abnormally sane and unimaginative habits of mind. He
absolutely refused to be alone for the rest of that evening, and he told
me afterwards that for many nights he had not dared to put out his light
before going to sleep. However, the main traits of the figure I can at
least indicate. At first you saw only a mass of coarse, matted black
hair; presently it was seen that this covered a body of fearful
thinness, almost a skeleton, but with the muscles standing out like
wires. The hands were of a dusky pallor, covered, like the body, with
long, coarse hairs, and hideously taloned. The eyes, touched in with a
burning yellow, had intensely black pupils, and were fixed upon the
throned king with a look of beast-like hate. Imagine one of the awful
bird-catching spiders of South America translated into human form, and
endowed with intelligence just less than human, and you will have some
faint conception of the terror inspired by the appalling effigy. One
remark is universally made by those to whom I have shown the picture:
"It was drawn from the life."

As soon as the first shock of his irresistible fright had subsided,
Dennistoun stole a look at his hosts. The sacristan's hands were pressed
upon his eyes; his daughter, looking up at the cross on the wall, was
telling her beads feverishly.

At last the question was asked, "Is this book for sale?"

There was the same hesitation, the same plunge of determination, that he
had noticed before, and then came the welcome answer, "If monsieur
pleases."

"How much do you ask for it?"

"I will take two hundred and fifty francs."

This was confounding. Even a collector's conscience is sometimes
stirred, and Dennistoun's conscience was tenderer than a collector's.

"My good man!" he said again and again, "your book is worth far more
than two hundred and fifty francs, I assure you--far more."

But the answer did not vary: "I will take two hundred and fifty francs,
not more."

There was really no possibility of refusing such a chance. The money was
paid, the receipt signed, a glass of wine drunk over the transaction,
and then the sacristan seemed to become a new man. He stood upright, he
ceased to throw those suspicious glances behind him, he actually laughed
or tried to laugh. Dennistoun rose to go.

"I shall have the honor of accompanying monsieur to his hotel?" said the
sacristan.

"Oh no, thanks! it isn't a hundred yards. I know the way perfectly, and
there is a moon."

The offer was pressed three or four times, and refused as often.

"Then, monsieur will summon me if--if he finds occasion; he will keep
the middle of the road, the sides are so rough."

"Certainly, certainly," said Dennistoun, who was impatient to examine
his prize by himself; and he stepped out into the passage with his book
under his arm.

Here he was met by the daughter; she, it appeared, was anxious to do a
little business on her own account; perhaps, like Gehazi, to "take
somewhat" from the foreigner whom her father had spared.

"A silver crucifix and chain for the neck; monsieur would perhaps be
good enough to accept it?"

Well, really, Dennistoun hadn't much use for these things. What did
mademoiselle want for it?

"Nothing--nothing in the world. Monsieur is more than welcome to it."

The tone in which this and much more was said was unmistakably genuine,
so that Dennistoun was reduced to profuse thanks, and submitted to have
the chain put round his neck. It really seemed as if he had rendered the
father and daughter some service which they hardly knew how to repay. As
he set off with his book they stood at the door looking after him, and
they were still looking when he waved them a last good-night from the
steps of the Chapeau Rouge.

Dinner was over, and Dennistoun was in his bedroom, shut up alone with
his acquisition. The landlady had manifested a particular interest in
him since he had told her that he had paid a visit to the sacristan and
bought an old book from him. He thought, too, that he had heard a
hurried dialogue between her and the said sacristan in the passage
outside the _salle Ã  manger_; some words to the effect that "Pierre and
Bertrand would be sleeping in the house" had closed the conversation.

At this time a growing feeling of discomfort had been creeping over
him--nervous reaction, perhaps, after the delight of his discovery.
Whatever it was, it resulted in a conviction that there was some one
behind him, and that he was far more comfortable with his back to the
wall. All this, of course, weighed light in the balance as against the
obvious value of the collection he had acquired. And now, as I said, he
was alone in his bedroom, taking stock of Canon Alberic's treasures, in
which every moment revealed something more charming.

"Bless Canon Alberic!" said Dennistoun, who had an inveterate habit of
talking to himself. "I wonder where he is now? Dear me! I wish that
landlady would learn to laugh in a more cheering manner; it makes one
feel as if there was some one dead in the house. Half a pipe more, did
you say? I think perhaps you are right. I wonder what that crucifix is
that the young woman insisted on giving me? Last century, I suppose.
Yes, probably. It is rather a nuisance of a thing to have round one's
neck--just too heavy. Most likely her father had been wearing it for
years. I think I might give it a clean up before I put it away."

He had taken the crucifix off, and laid it on the table, when his
attention was caught by an object lying on the red cloth just by his
left elbow. Two or three ideas of what it might be flitted through his
brain with their own incalculable quickness.

"A penwiper? No, no such thing in the house. A rat? No, too black. A
large spider? I trust to goodness not--no. Good God! a hand like the
hand in that picture!"

In another infinitesimal flash he had taken it in. Pale, dusky skin,
covering nothing but bones and tendons of appalling strength; coarse
black hairs, longer than ever grew on a human hand; nails rising from
the ends of the fingers and curving sharply down and forward, gray,
horny and wrinkled.

He flew out of his chair with deadly, inconceivable terror clutching at
his heart. The shape, whose left hand rested on the table, was rising to
a standing posture behind his seat, its right hand crooked above his
scalp. There was black and tattered drapery about it; the coarse hair
covered it as in the drawing. The lower jaw was thin--what can I call
it?--shallow, like a beast's; teeth showed behind the black lips; there
was no nose; the eyes, of a fiery yellow, against which the pupils
showed black and intense, and the exulting hate and thirst to destroy
life which shone there, were the most horrifying feature in the whole
vision. There was intelligence of a kind in them--intelligence beyond
that of a beast, below that of a man.

The feelings which this horror stirred in Dennistoun were the intensest
physical fear and the most profound mental loathing. What did he do?
What could he do? He has never been quite certain what words he said,
but he knows that he spoke, that he grasped blindly at the silver
crucifix, that he was conscious of a movement towards him on the part of
the demon, and that he screamed with the voice of an animal in hideous
pain.

Pierre and Bertrand, the two sturdy little serving-men, who rushed in,
saw nothing, but felt themselves thrust aside by something that passed
out between them, and found Dennistoun in a swoon. They sat up with him
that night, and his two friends were at St. Bertrand by nine o'clock
next morning. He himself, though still shaken and nervous, was almost
himself by that time, and his story found credence with them, though not
until they had seen the drawing and talked with the sacristan.

Almost at dawn the little man had come to the inn on some pretense, and
had listened with the deepest interest to the story retailed by the
landlady. He showed no surprise.

"It is he--it is he! I have seen him myself," was his only comment; and
to all questionings but one reply was vouchsafed: "Deux fois je l'ai vu;
mille fois je l'ai senti." He would tell them nothing of the provenance
of the book, nor any details of his experiences. "I shall soon sleep,
and my rest will be sweet. Why should you trouble me?" he said.[B]

We shall never know what he or Canon Alberic de MaulÃ©on suffered. At the
back of that fateful drawing were some lines of writing which may be
supposed to throw light on the situation:

            "Contradictio Salomonis cum demonio nocturno.
                  Albericus de Mauleone delineavit.
               V. Deus in adiutorium. Ps. Qui habitat.
    Sancte Bertrande, demoniorum effugator, intercede pro me miserrimo.
          Primum uidi nocte 12^{mi} Dec. 1694: uidebo mox ultimum.
      Peccaui et passus sum, plura adhuc passurus. Dec. 29, 1701."[C]

I have never quite understood what was Dennistoun's view of the events
I have narrated. He quoted to me once a test from Ecclesiasticus: "Some
spirits there be that are created for vengeance, and in their fury lay
on sore strokes." On another occasion he said: "Isaiah was a very
sensible man; doesn't he say something about night monsters living in
the ruins of Babylon? These things are rather beyond us at present."

Another confidence of his impressed me rather, and I sympathized with
it. We had been, last year, to Comminges, to see Canon Alberic's tomb.
It is a great marble erection with an effigy of the Canon in a large wig
and soutane, and an elaborate eulogy of his learning below. I saw
Dennistoun talking for some time with the Vicar of St. Bertrand's, and
as we drove away he said to me: "I hope it isn't wrong: you know I am a
Presbyterian--but I--I believe there will be 'saying of Mass and singing
of dirges' for Alberic de MaulÃ©on's rest." Then he added, with a touch
of the Northern British in his tone, "I had no notion they came so
dear."

       *       *       *       *       *

The book is in the Wentworth Collection at Cambridge. The drawing was
photographed and then burnt by Dennistoun on the day when he left
Comminges on the occasion of his first visit.

THE HAUNTED AND THE HAUNTERS

OR,

THE HOUSE AND THE BRAIN

BY EDWARD BULWER-LYTTON


A friend of mine, who is a man of letters and a philosopher, said to me
one day, as if between jest and earnest,--"Fancy! since we last met, I
have discovered a haunted house in the midst of London."

"Really haunted?--and by what? ghosts?"

"Well, I can't answer that question: all I know is this--six weeks ago
my wife and I were in search of a furnished apartment. Passing a quiet
street, we saw on the window of one of the houses a bill, 'Apartments
Furnished.' The situation suited us; we entered the house--liked the
rooms--engaged them by the week--and left them the third day. No power
on earth could have reconciled my wife to stay longer; and I don't
wonder at it."

"What did you see?"

"Excuse me--I have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious
dreamer--nor, on the other hand, could I ask you to accept on my
affirmation what you would hold to be incredible without the evidence of
your own senses. Let me only say this, it was not so much what we saw or
heard (in which you might fairly suppose that we were the dupes of our
own excited fancy, or the victims of imposture in others) that drove us
away, as it was an undefinable terror which seized both of us whenever
we passed by the door of a certain unfurnished room, in which we neither
saw nor heard anything. And the strangest marvel of all was, that for
once in my life I agreed with my wife, silly woman though she be--and
allowed, after the third night, that it was impossible to stay a fourth
in that house. Accordingly, on the fourth morning I summoned the woman
who kept the house and attended on us, and told her that the rooms did
not quite suit us, and we would not stay out our week. She said, dryly,
'I know why: you have stayed longer than any other lodger. Few ever
stayed a second night; none before you a third. But I take it they have
been very kind to you.'

"'They--who?' I asked, affecting to smile.

"'Why, they who haunt the house, whoever they are. I don't mind them;
I remember them many years ago, when I lived in this house, not as a
servant; but I know they will be the death of me some day. I don't
care--I'm old, and must die soon anyhow; and then I shall be with them,
and in this house still.' The woman spoke with so dreary a calmness,
that really it was a sort of awe that prevented my conversing with her
further. I paid for my week, and too happy were my wife and I to get off
so cheaply."

"You excite my curiosity," said I; "nothing I should like better than to
sleep in a haunted house. Pray give me the address of the one which you
left so ignominiously."

My friend gave me the address; and when we parted, I walked straight
towards the house thus indicated.

It is situated on the North side of Oxford Street (in a dull but
respectable thoroughfare). I found the house shut up--no bill at the
window, and no response to my knock. As I was turning away, a beer-boy,
collecting pewter pots at the neighboring areas, said to me, "Do you
want any one at that house, sir?"

"Yes, I heard it was to be let."

"Let!--why, the woman who kept it is dead--has been dead these three
weeks, and no one can be found to stay there, though Mr. J---- offered
ever so much. He offered mother, who chars for him, Â£1 a week just to
open and shut the windows, and she would not."

"Would not!--and why?"

"The house is haunted: and the old woman who kept it was found dead in
her bed, with her eyes wide open. They say the devil strangled her."

"Pooh!--you speak of Mr. J----. Is he the owner of the house?"

"Yes."

"Where does he live?"

"In G---- Street, No. --."

"What is he?--in any business?"

"No, sir--nothing particular; a single gentleman."

I gave the pot-boy the gratuity earned by his liberal information, and
proceeded to Mr. J----, in G---- Street, which was close by the street
that boasted the haunted house. I was lucky enough to find Mr. J---- at
home--an elderly man, with intelligent countenance and prepossessing
manners.

I communicated my name and my business frankly. I said I heard the house
was considered to be haunted--that I had a strong desire to examine a
house with so equivocal a reputation--that I should be greatly obliged
if he would allow me to hire it, though only for a night. I was willing
to pay for that privilege whatever he might be inclined to ask. "Sir,"
said Mr. J----, with great courtesy, "the house is at your service, for
as short or as long a time as you please. Rent is out of the
question--the obligation will be on my side should you be able to
discover the cause of the strange phenomena which at present deprive it
of all value. I cannot let it, for I cannot even get a servant to keep
it in order or answer the door. Unluckily the house is haunted, if I may
use that expression, not only by night, but by day; though at night the
disturbances are of a more unpleasant and sometimes of a more alarming
character. The poor old woman who died in it three weeks ago was a
pauper whom I took out of a workhouse, for in her childhood she had been
known to some of my family, and had once been in such good circumstances
that she had rented that house of my uncle. She was a woman of superior
education and strong mind, and was the only person I could ever induce
to remain in the house. Indeed, since her death, which was sudden, and
the coroner's inquest, which gave it a notoriety in the neighborhood,
I have so despaired of finding any person to take charge of the house,
much more a tenant, that I would willingly let it rent-free for a year
to any one who would pay its rates and taxes."

"How long is it since the house acquired this sinister character?"

"That I can scarcely tell you, but very many years since. The old woman
I spoke of said it was haunted when she rented it between thirty and
forty years ago. The fact is, that my life has been spent in the East
Indies, and in the civil service of the Company. I returned to England
last year, on inheriting the fortune of an uncle, among whose
possessions was the house in question. I found it shut up and
uninhabited. I was told that it was haunted, that no one would inhabit
it. I smiled at what seemed to me so idle a story. I spent some money in
repairing it--added to its old-fashioned furniture a few modern
articles--advertised it, and obtained a lodger for a year. He was a
colonel retired on half-pay. He came in with his family, a son and a
daughter, and four or five servants: they all left the house the next
day; and, although each of them declared that he had seen something
different from that which had scared the others, a something still was
equally terrible to all. I really could not in conscience sue, nor even
blame, the colonel for breach of agreement. Then I put in the old woman
I have spoken of, and she was empowered to let the house in apartments.
I never had one lodger who stayed more than three days. I do not tell
you their stories--to no two lodgers have there been exactly the same
phenomena repeated. It is better that you should judge for yourself,
than enter the house with an imagination influenced by previous
narratives; only be prepared to see and to hear something or other, and
take whatever precautions you yourself please."

"Have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that house?"

"Yes. I passed not a night, but three hours in broad daylight alone in
that house. My curiosity is not satisfied but it is quenched. I have no
desire to renew the experiment. You cannot complain, you see, sir, that
I am not sufficiently candid; and unless your interest be exceedingly
eager and your nerves unusually strong, I honestly add, that I advise
you not to pass a night in that house."

"My interest _is_ exceedingly keen," said I, "and though only a coward
will boast of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to him, yet my
nerves have been seasoned in such variety of danger that I have the
right to rely on them--even in a haunted house."

Mr. J---- said very little more; he took the keys of the house out of
his bureau, gave them to me--and, thanking him cordially for his
frankness, and his urbane concession to my wish, I carried off my prize.

Impatient for the experiment, as soon as I reached home, I summoned my
confidential servant--a young man of gay spirits, fearless temper, and
as free from superstitious prejudices as any one I could think of.

"F----," said I, "you remember in Germany how disappointed we were at
not finding a ghost in that old castle, which was said to be haunted by
a headless apparition? Well, I have heard of a house in London which,
I have reason to hope, is decidedly haunted. I mean to sleep there
to-night. From what I hear, there is no doubt that something will allow
itself to be seen or to be heard--something, perhaps, excessively
horrible. Do you think if I take you with me, I may rely on your
presence of mind, whatever may happen?"

"Oh, sir! pray trust me," answered F----, grinning with delight.

"Very well; then here are the keys of the house--this is the address. Go
now--select for me any bedroom you please; and since the house has not
been inhabited for weeks, make up a good fire--air the bed well--see, of
course, that there are candles as well as fuel. Take with you my
revolver and my dagger--so much for my weapons--arm yourself equally
well; and if we are not a match for a dozen ghosts, we shall be but a
sorry couple of Englishmen."

I was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that I had
not leisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which I had
plighted my honor. I dined alone, and very late, and while dining, read,
as is my habit. I selected one of the volumes of Macaulay's Essays.
I thought to myself that I would take the book with me; there was so
much of the healthfulness in the style, and practical life in the
subjects, that it would serve as an antidote against the influence of
superstitious fancy.

Accordingly, about half-past nine, I put the book into my pocket, and
strolled leisurely towards the haunted house. I took with me a favorite
dog--an exceedingly sharp, bold and vigilant bull-terrier--a dog fond of
prowling about strange ghostly corners and passages at night in search
of rats--a dog of dogs for a ghost.

It was a summer night, but chilly, the sky somewhat gloomy and overcast.
Still there was a moon--faint and sickly, but still a moon--and if the
clouds permitted, after midnight it would be brighter.

I reached the house, knocked, and my servant opened with a cheerful
smile.

"All right, sir, and very comfortable."

"Oh!" said I, rather disappointed; "have you not seen nor heard anything
remarkable?"

"Well, sir, I must own I have heard something queer."

"What?--what?"

"The sound of feet pattering behind me; and once or twice small noises
like whispers close at my ear--nothing more."

"You are not at all frightened?"

"I! not a bit of it, sir," and the man's bold look reassured me on one
point--viz., that happen what might, he would not desert me.

We were in the hall, the street-door closed, and my attention was now
drawn to my dog. He had at first run in eagerly enough, but had sneaked
back to the door, and was scratching and whining to get out. After
patting him on the head, and encouraging him gently, the dog seemed to
reconcile himself to the situation, and followed me and F---- through
the house, but keeping close at my heels instead of hurrying
inquisitively in advance, which was his usual and normal habit in all
strange places. We first visited the subterranean apartments, the
kitchen and other offices, and especially the cellars, in which last
there were two or three bottles of wine still left in a bin, covered
with cobwebs, and evidently, by their appearance, undisturbed for many
years. It was clear that the ghosts were not wine-bibbers. For the rest
we discovered nothing of interest. There was a gloomy little backyard
with very high walls. The stones of this yard were very damp; and what
with the damp, and what with the dust and smoke-grime on the pavement,
our feet left a slight impression where we passed.

And now appeared the first strange phenomenon witnessed by myself in
this strange abode. I saw, just before me, the print of a foot suddenly
form itself, as it were. I stopped, caught hold of my servant, and
pointed to it. In advance of that footprint as suddenly dropped another.
We both saw it. I advanced quickly to the place; the footprint kept
advancing before me, a small footprint--the foot of a child; the
impression was too faint thoroughly to distinguish the shape, but it
seemed to us both that it was the print of a naked foot. This phenomenon
ceased when we arrived at the opposite wall, nor did it repeat itself on
returning. We remounted the stairs, and entered the rooms on the ground
floor, a dining-parlor, a small back parlor, and a still smaller third
room that had been probably appropriated to a footman--all still as
death. We then visited the drawing-rooms, which seemed fresh and new. In
the front room I seated myself in an armchair. F---- placed on the table
the candlestick with which he had lighted us. I told him to shut the
door. As he turned to do so, a chair opposite to me moved from the wall
quickly and noiselessly, and dropped itself about a yard from my own
chair, immediately fronting it.

"Why, this is better than the turning tables," said I, with a
half-laugh; and as I laughed, my dog put back his head and howled.

F----, coming back, had not observed the movement of the chair. He
employed himself now in stilling the dog. I continued to gaze on the
chair, and fancied I saw on it a pale blue misty outline of a human
figure, but an outline so indistinct that I could only distrust my own
vision. The dog now was quiet.

"Put back that chair opposite me," said I to F----; "put it back to the
wall."

F---- obeyed. "Was that you, sir?" said he, turning abruptly.

"I!--what?"

"Why, something struck me. I felt it sharply on the shoulder--just
here."

"No," said I. "But we have jugglers present, and though we may not
discover their tricks, we shall catch _them_ before they frighten _us_."

We did not stay long in the drawing-rooms--in fact, they felt so damp
and so chilly that I was glad to get to the fire upstairs. We locked the
doors of the drawing-rooms--a precaution which, I should observe, we had
taken with all the rooms we had searched below. The bedroom my servant
had selected for me was the best on the floor--a large one, with two
windows fronting the street. The four-posted bed, which took up no
inconsiderable space, was opposite to the fire, which burnt clear and
bright; a door in the wall to the left, between the bed and the window,
communicated with the room which my servant appropriated to himself.
This last was a small room with a sofa-bed, and had no communication
with the landing-place--no other door but that which conducted to the
bedroom I was to occupy. On either side of my fireplace was a cupboard,
without locks, flush with the wall and covered with the same dull-brown
paper. We examined these cupboards--only hooks to suspend female
dresses--nothing else; we sounded the walls--evidently solid--the outer
walls of the building. Having finished the survey of these apartments,
warmed myself a few moments, and lighted my cigar, I then, still
accompanied by F----, went forth to complete my reconnoiter. In the
landing-place there was another door; it was closed firmly. "Sir," said
my servant, in surprise, "I unlocked this door with all the others when
I first came; it cannot have got locked from the inside, for----"

Before he had finished his sentence, the door, which neither of us then
was touching, opened quietly of itself. We looked at each other a single
instant. The same thought seized both--some human agency might be
detected here. I rushed in first, my servant followed. A small blank
dreary room without furniture--few empty boxes and hampers in a
corner--a small window--the shutters closed--not even a fireplace--no
other door than that by which we had entered--no carpet on the floor,
and the floor seemed very old, uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and
there, as was shown by the whiter patches on the wood; but no living
being, and no visible place in which a living being could have hidden.
As we stood gazing round, the door by which we had entered closed as
quietly as it had before opened: we were imprisoned.

For the first time I felt a creep of undefinable horror. Not so my
servant. "Why, they don't think to trap us, sir; I could break the
trumpery door with a kick of my foot."

"Try first if it will open to your hand," said I, shaking off the vague
apprehension that had seized me, "while I unclose the shutters and see
what is without."

I unbarred the shutters--the window looked on the little back yard I
have before described; there was no ledge without--nothing to break the
sheer descent of the wall. No man getting out of that window would have
found any footing till he had fallen on the stones below.

F----, meanwhile, was vainly attempting to open the door. He now turned
round to me and asked my permission to use force. And I should here
state, in justice to the servant, that, far from evincing any
superstitious terrors, his nerve, composure, and even gayety amidst
circumstances so extraordinary, compelled my admiration, and made me
congratulate myself on having secured a companion in every way fitted to
the occasion. I willingly gave him the permission he required. But
though he was a remarkably strong man, his force was as idle as his
milder efforts; the door did not even shake to his stoutest kick.
Breathless and panting, he desisted. I then tried the door myself,
equally in vain. As I ceased from the effort, again that creep of horror
came over me; but this time it was more cold and stubborn. I felt as if
some strange and ghastly exhalation were rising up from the chinks of
that rugged floor, and filling the atmosphere with a venomous influence
hostile to human life. The door now very slowly and quietly opened as
of its own accord. We precipitated ourselves into the landing-place. We
both saw a large pale light--as large as the human figure but shapeless
and unsubstantial--move before us, and ascend the stairs that led from
the landing into the attics. I followed the light, and my servant
followed me. It entered, to the right of the landing, a small garret, of
which the door stood open. I entered in the same instant. The light then
collapsed into a small globule, exceedingly brilliant and vivid; rested
a moment on a bed in the corner, quivered, and vanished.

We approached the bed and examined it--a half-tester, such as is
commonly found in attics devoted to servants. On the drawers that stood
near it we perceived an old faded silk kerchief, with the needle still
left in a rent half repaired. The kerchief was covered with dust;
probably it had belonged to the old woman who had last died in that
house, and this might have been her sleeping room. I had sufficient
curiosity to open the drawers: there were a few odds and ends of female
dress, and two letters tied round with a narrow ribbon of faded yellow.
I took the liberty to possess myself of the letters. We found nothing
else in the room worth noticing--nor did the light reappear; but we
distinctly heard, as we turned to go, a pattering footfall on the
floor--just before us. We went through the other attics (in all four),
the footfall still preceding us. Nothing to be seen--nothing but the
footfall heard. I had the letters in my hand: just as I was descending
the stairs I distinctly felt my wrist seized, and a faint soft effort
made to draw the letters from my clasp. I only held them the more
tightly, and the effort ceased.

We regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself, and I then remarked
that my dog had not followed us when we had left it. He was thrusting
himself close to the fire, and trembling. I was impatient to examine the
letters; and while I read them, my servant opened a little box in which
he had deposited the weapons I had ordered him to bring; took them out,
placed them on a table close at my bed-head, and then occupied himself
in soothing the dog, who, however, seemed to heed him very little.

The letters were short--they were dated; the dates exactly thirty-five
years ago. They were evidently from a lover to his mistress, or a
husband to some young wife. Not only the terms of expression, but a
distinct reference to a former voyage, indicated the writer to have been
a seafarer. The spelling and handwriting were those of a man imperfectly
educated, but still the language itself was forcible. In the expressions
of endearment there was a kind of rough wild love; but here and there
were dark and unintelligible hints at some secret not of love--some
secret that seemed of crime. "We ought to love each other," was one of
the sentences I remember, "for how every one else would execrate us if
all was known." Again: "Don't let any one be in the same room with you
at night--you talk in your sleep." And again: "What's done can't be
undone; and I tell you there's nothing against us unless the dead could
come to life." Here there was underlined in a better handwriting (a
female's), "They do!" At the end of the letter latest in date the same
female hand had written these words: "Lost at sea the 4th of June, the
same day as ----."

I put down the letters, and began to muse over their contents.

Fearing, however, that the train of thought into which I fell might
unsteady my nerves, I fully determined to keep my mind in a fit state to
cope with whatever of marvelous the advancing night might bring forth.
I roused myself--laid the letters on the table--stirred up the fire,
which was still bright and cheering--and opened my volume of Macaulay.
I read quietly enough till about half-past eleven. I then threw myself
dressed upon the bed, and told my servant he might retire to his own
room, but must keep himself awake. I bade him leave open the door between
the two rooms. Thus alone, I kept two candles burning on the table by my
bed-head. I placed my watch beside the weapons, and calmly resumed my
Macaulay. Opposite to me the fire burned clear; and on the hearthrug,
seemingly asleep, lay the dog. In about twenty minutes I felt an
exceedingly cold air pass by my cheek, like a sudden draught. I fancied
the door to my right, communicating with the landing-place, must have
got open; but no--it was closed. I then turned my glance to my left, and
saw the flame of the candles violently swayed as by a wind. At the same
moment the watch beside the revolver softly slid from the table--softly,
softly--no visible hand--it was gone. I sprang up, seizing the revolver
with the one hand, the dagger with other: I was not willing that my
weapons should share the fate of the watch. Thus armed, I looked round
the floor--no sign of the watch. Three slow, loud, distinct knocks were
now heard at the bed-head; my servant called out, "Is that you, sir?"

"No; be on your guard."

The dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches, his ears moving
quickly backwards and forwards. He kept his eyes fixed on me with a look
so strange that he concentered all my attention on himself. Slowly he
rose up, all his hair bristling, and stood perfectly rigid, and with the
same wild stare. I had no time, however, to examine the dog. Presently
my servant emerged from his room; and if ever I saw horror in the human
face, it was then. I should not have recognized him had we met in the
street, so altered was every lineament. He passed by me quickly, saying
in a whisper that seemed scarcely to come from his lips, "Run--run! it
is after me!" He gained the door to the landing, pulled it open, and
rushed forth. I followed him into the landing involuntarily, calling him
to stop; but, without heeding me, he bounded down the stairs, clinging
to the balusters, and taking several steps at a time. I heard, where I
stood, the street-door open--heard it again clap to. I was left alone in
the haunted house.

It was but for a moment that I remained undecided whether or not to
follow my servant; pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a
flight. I re-entered my room, closing the door after me, and proceeded
cautiously into the interior chamber. I encountered nothing to justify
my servant's terror. I again carefully examined the walls, to see if
there were any concealed door. I could find no trace of one--not even a
seam in the dull-brown paper with which the room was hung. How, then,
had the THING, whatever it was, which had so scared him, obtained
ingress except through my own chamber?

I returned to my room, shut and locked the door that opened upon the
interior one, and stood on the hearth, expectant and prepared. I now
perceived that the dog had slunk into an angle of the wall, and was
pressing himself close against it, as if literally striving to force his
way into it. I approached the animal and spoke to it; the poor brute was
evidently beside itself with terror. It showed all its teeth, the slaver
dropping from its jaws, and would certainly have bitten me if I had
touched it. It did not seem to recognize me. Whoever has seen at the
Zoological Gardens a rabbit fascinated by a serpent, cowering in a
corner, may form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited.
Finding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain, and fearing that his
bite might be as venomous in that state as in the madness of
hydrophobia, I left him alone, placed my weapons on the table beside the
fire, seated myself, and recommenced my Macaulay.

Perhaps, in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage, or rather
a coolness, which the reader may conceive I exaggerate, I may be
pardoned if I pause to indulge in one or two egotistical remarks.

As I hold presence of mind, or what is called courage, to be precisely
proportioned to familiarity with the circumstances that lead to it, so I
should say that I had been long sufficiently familiar with all
experiments that appertain to the Marvelous. I had witnessed many very
extraordinary phenomena in various parts of the world--phenomena that
would be either totally disbelieved if I stated them, or ascribed to
supernatural agencies. Now, my theory is that the Supernatural is the
Impossible, and that what is called supernatural is only a something in
the laws of nature of which we have been hitherto ignorant. Therefore,
if a ghost rise before me, I have not the right to say, "So, then, the
supernatural is possible," but rather, "So, then, the apparition of a
ghost is, contrary to received opinion, within the laws of
nature--_i.e._, not supernatural."

Now, in all that I had hitherto witnessed, and indeed in all the wonders
which the amateurs of mystery in our age record as facts, a material
living agency is always required. On the continent you will find still
magicians who assert that they can raise spirits. Assume for the moment
that they assert truly, still the living material form of the magician
is present; and he is the material agency by which, from some
constitutional peculiarities, certain strange phenomena are represented
to your natural senses.

Accept, again, as truthful, the tales of spirit Manifestation in
America--musical or other sounds--writings on paper, produced by no
discernible hand--articles of furniture moved without apparent human
agency--or the actual sight and touch of hands, to which no bodies seem
to belong--still there must be found the MEDIUM or living being, with
constitutional peculiarities capable of obtaining these signs. In fine,
in all such marvels, supposing even that there is no imposture, there
must be a human being like ourselves by whom, or through whom, the
effects presented to human beings are produced. It is so with the now
familiar phenomena of mesmerism or electro-biology; the mind of the
person operated on is affected through a material living agent. Nor,
supposing it true that a mesmerized patient can respond to the will or
passes of a mesmerizer a hundred miles distant, is the response less
occasioned by a material fluid--call it Electric, call it Odic, call it
what you will--which has the power of traversing space and passing
obstacles, that the material effect is communicated from one to the
other. Hence all that I had hitherto witnessed, or expected to witness,
in this strange house, I believed to be occasioned through some agency
or medium as mortal as myself: and this idea necessarily prevented the
awe with which those who regard as supernatural, things that are not
within the ordinary operations of nature, might have been impressed by
the adventures of that memorable night.

As, then, it was my conjecture that all that was presented, or would be
presented to my senses, must originate in some human being gifted by
constitution with the power so to present them, and having some motive
so to do, I felt an interest in my theory which, in its way, was rather
philosophical than superstitious. And I can sincerely say that I was in
as tranquil a temper for observation as any practical experimentalist
could be in awaiting the effect of some rare, though perhaps perilous,
chemical combination. Of course, the more I kept my mind detached from
fancy, the more the temper fitted for observation would be obtained; and
I therefore riveted eye and thought on the strong daylight sense in the
page of my Macaulay.

I now became aware that something interposed between the page and the
light--the page was over-shadowed: I looked up, and I saw what I shall
find it very difficult, perhaps impossible, to describe.

It was a Darkness shaping itself forth from the air in very undefined
outline. I cannot say it was of a human form, and yet it had more
resemblance to a human form, or rather shadow, than to anything else. As
it stood, wholly apart and distinct from the air and the light around
it, its dimensions seemed gigantic, the summit nearly touching the
ceiling. While I gazed, a feeling of intense cold seized me. An iceberg
before me could not more have chilled me; nor could the cold of an
iceberg have been more purely physical. I feel convinced that it was not
the cold caused by fear. As I continued to gaze, I thought--but this I
cannot say with precision--that I distinguished two eyes looking down on
me from the height. One moment I fancied that I distinguished them
clearly, the next they seemed gone; but still two rays of a pale-blue
light frequently shot through the darkness, as from the height on which
I half believed, half doubted, that I had encountered the eyes.

I strove to speak--my voice utterly failed me; I could only think
to myself, "is this fear? it is _not_ fear!" I strove to rise--in
vain; I felt as if weighed down by an irresistible force. Indeed, my
impression was that of an immense and overwhelming Power opposed to any
volition;--that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a force beyond
man's, which one may feel _physically_ in a storm at sea, in a
conflagration, or when confronting some terrible wild beast, or rather,
perhaps, the shark of the ocean, I felt _morally_. Opposed to my will
was another will, as far superior to its strength as storm, fire, and
shark are superior in material force to the force of man.

And now, as this impression grew on me--now came, at last,
horror--horror to a degree that no words can convey. Still I retained
pride, if not courage; and in my own mind I said, "This is horror, but
it is not fear; unless I fear I cannot be harmed; my reason rejects this
thing, it is an illusion--I do not fear." With a violent effort I
succeeded at last in stretching out my hand towards the weapon on the
table: as I did so, on the arm and shoulder I received a strange shock,
and my arm fell to my side powerless. And now, to add to my horror, the
light began slowly to wane from the candles, they were not, as it were,
extinguished, but their flame seemed very gradually withdrawn: it was
the same with the fire--the light was extracted from the fuel; in a few
minutes the room was in utter darkness.

The dread that came over me, to be thus in the dark with that dark
Thing, whose power was so intensely felt, brought a reaction of nerve.
In fact, terror had reached that climax, that either my senses must have
deserted me, or I must have burst through the spell. I did burst through
it. I found voice, though the voice was a shriek. I remember that I
broke forth with words like these--"I do not fear, my soul does not
fear"; and at the same time I found the strength to rise. Still in that
profound gloom I rushed to one of the windows--tore aside the
curtain--flung open the shutters; my first thought was--LIGHT.--And when
I saw the moon high, clear, and calm, I felt a joy that almost
compensated for the previous terror. There was the moon, there was also
the light from the gas-lamps in the deserted slumberous street. I turned
to look back into the room; the moon penetrated its shadow very palely
and partially--but still there was light. The dark Thing, whatever it
might be, was gone--except that I could yet see a dim shadow, which
seemed the shadow of that shade, against the opposite wall.

My eye now rested on the table, and from under the table (which was
without cloth or cover--an old mahogany round table) there rose a hand,
visible as far as the wrist. It was a hand, seemingly, as much of flesh
and blood as my own, but the hand of an aged person--lean, wrinkled,
small, too--a woman's hand. That hand very softly closed on the two
letters that lay on the table: hand and letters both vanished.

There then came the same three loud measured knocks I heard at the
bed-head before this extraordinary drama had commenced.

As those sounds slowly ceased, I felt the whole room vibrate sensibly;
and at the far end there rose, as from the floor, sparks or globules
like bubbles of light, many-colored--green, yellow, fire-red, azure. Up
and down, to and fro, hither, thither, as tiny Will-o'-the-Wisps the
sparks moved, slow or swift, each at his own caprice. A chair (as in the
drawing-room below) was now advanced from the wall without apparent
agency, and placed at the opposite side of the table. Suddenly as forth
from the chair, there grew a shape--a woman's shape. It was distinct as
a shape of life--ghastly as a shape of death. The face was that of
youth, with a strange mournful beauty: the throat and shoulders were
bare, the rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white. It began
sleeking its long yellow hair, which fell over its shoulders; its eyes
were not turned towards me, but to the door; it seemed listening,
watching, waiting. The shadow of the shade in the background grew
darker; and again I thought I beheld the eyes gleaming out from the
summit of the shadow--eyes fixed upon that shape.

As if from the door, though it did not open, there grew out another
shape, equally distinct, equally ghastly--a man's shape--a young man's.
It was in the dress of the last century, or rather in a likeness of such
dress (for both the male shape and the female, though defined, were
evidently unsubstantial, impalpable--simulacra--phantasms); and there
was something incongruous, grotesque, yet fearful, in the contrast
between the elaborate finery, the courtly precision of that
old-fashioned garb, with its ruffles and lace and buckles, and the
corpse-like aspect and ghost-like stillness of the flitting wearer. Just
as the male shape approached the female, the dark shadow started from
the wall, all three for a moment wrapped in darkness. When the pale
light returned, the two phantoms were as in the grasp of the shadow that
towered between them; and there was a blood-stain on the breast of the
female; and the phantom male was leaning on its phantom sword, and blood
seemed trickling fast from the ruffles, from the lace; and the darkness
of the intermediate Shadow swallowed them up--they were gone. And again
the bubbles of light shot, and sailed, and undulated, growing thicker
and thicker and more wildly confused in their movements.

The closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened, and from the
aperture there came the form of an aged woman. In her hand she held
letters,--the very letters over which I had seen _the_ Hand close; and
behind her I heard a footstep. She turned round as if to listen, and
then she opened the letters and seemed to read; and over her shoulder I
saw a livid face, the face as of a man long drowned--bloated, bleached,
seaweed tangled in its dripping hair; and at her feet lay a form as of a
corpse, and beside the corpse there cowered a child, a miserable squalid
child, with famine in its cheeks and fear in its eyes. And as I looked
in the old woman's face, the wrinkles and lines vanished and it became a
face of youth--hard-eyed, stony, but still youth; and the Shadow darted
forth, and darkened over these phantoms as it had darkened over the
last.

Nothing now was left but the Shadow, and on that my eyes were intently
fixed, till again eyes grew out of the Shadow--malignant, serpent eyes.
And the bubbles of light again rose and fell, and in their disorder,
irregular, turbulent maze, mingled with the wan moonlight. And now from
these globules themselves, as from the shell of an egg, monstrous things
burst out; the air grew filled with them; larvÃ¦ so bloodless and so
hideous that I can in no way describe them except to remind the reader
of the swarming life which the solar microscope brings before his eyes
in a drop of water--things transparent, supple, agile, chasing each
other, devouring each other--forms like nought ever beheld by the naked
eye. As the shapes were without symmetry, so their movements were
without order. In their very vagrancies there was no sport; they came
round me and round, thicker and faster and swifter, swarming over my
head, crawling over my right arm, which was outstretched in involuntary
command against all evil beings. Sometimes I felt myself touched, but
not by them; invisible hands touched me. Once I felt the clutch as of
cold soft fingers at my throat. I was still equally conscious that if I
gave way to fear I should be in bodily peril; and I concentrated all my
faculties in the single focus of resisting, stubborn will. And I turned
my sight from the Shadow--above all, from those strange serpent
eyes--eyes that had now become distinctly visible. For there, though in
nought else round me, I was aware that there was a WILL, and a will of
intense, creative, working evil, which might crush down my own.

The pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as if in the air of
some near conflagration. The larvÃ¦ grew lurid as things that live in
fire. Again the room vibrated; again were heard the three measured
knocks; and again all things were swallowed up in the darkness of the
dark Shadow, as if out of that darkness all had come, into that darkness
all returned.

As the gloom receded, the Shadow was wholly gone. Slowly as it had been
withdrawn, the flame grew again into the candles on the table, again
into the fuel in the grate. The whole room came once more calmly,
healthfully into sight.

The two doors were still closed, the door communicating with the
servant's room still locked. In the corner of the wall into which he had
so convulsively niched himself, lay the dog. I called to him--no
movement; I approached--the animal was dead; his eyes protruded; his
tongue out of his mouth; the froth gathered round his jaws. I took him
in my arms; I brought him to the fire, I felt acute grief for the loss
of my poor favorite--acute self-reproach; I accused myself of his death;
I imagined he had died of fright. But what was my surprise on finding
that his neck was actually broken. Had this been done in the dark?--must
it not have been by a hand human as mine?--must there not have been
a human agency all the while in that room? Good cause to suspect it.
I cannot tell. I cannot do more than state the fact fairly; the reader
may draw his own inference.

Another surprising circumstance--my watch was restored to the table from
which it had been so mysteriously withdrawn; but it had stopped at the
very moment it was so withdrawn; nor, despite all the skill of the
watchmaker, has it ever gone since--that is, it will go in a strange
erratic way for a few hours, and then come to a dead stop--it is
worthless.

Nothing more chanced for the rest of the night. Nor, indeed, had I long
to wait before the dawn broke. Nor till it was broad daylight did I quit
the haunted house. Before I did so, I revisited the little blind room in
which my servant and myself had been for a time imprisoned. I had a
strong impression--for which I could not account--that from that room
had originated the mechanism of the phenomena--if I may use the
term--which had been experienced in my chamber. And though I entered it
now in the clear day, with the sun peering through the filmy window I
still felt, as I stood on its floor, the creep of the horror which I had
first there experienced the night before, and which had been so
aggravated by what had passed in my own chamber. I could not, indeed,
bear to stay more than half a minute within those walls. I descended the
stairs, and again I heard the footfall before me; and when I opened the
street door, I thought I could distinguish a very low laugh. I gained my
own home, expecting to find my runaway servant there. But he had not
presented himself; nor did I hear more of him for three days, when I
received a letter from him, dated from Liverpool to this effect:--

          "HONORED SIR,--I humbly entreat your pardon,
          though I can scarcely hope that you will think I
          deserve it, unless--which Heaven forbid--you saw
          what I did. I feel that it will be years before
          I can recover myself: and as to being fit for
          service, it is out of the question. I am therefore
          going to my brother-in-law at Melbourne. The ship
          sails to-morrow. Perhaps the long voyage may set
          me up. I do nothing now but start and tremble, and
          fancy IT is behind me. I humbly beg you, honored
          sir, to order my clothes, and whatever wages are
          due to me, to be sent to my mother's, at
          Walworth.--John knows her address."

The letter ended with additional apologies, somewhat incoherent, and
explanatory details as to effects that had been under the writer's
charge.

This flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to go to
Australia, and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with the
events of the night. I say nothing in refutation of that conjecture;
rather, I suggest it as one that would seem to many persons the most
probable solution of improbable occurrences. My belief in my own theory
remained unshaken. I returned in the evening to the house, to bring away
in a hack cab the things I had left there, with my poor dog's body. In
this task I was not disturbed, nor did any incident worth note befall
me, except that still, on ascending and descending the stairs, I heard
the same footfall in advance. On leaving the house, I went to Mr. J.'s.
He was at home. I returned him the keys, told him that my curiosity was
sufficiently gratified, and was about to relate quickly what had passed,
when he stopped me, and said, though with much politeness, that he had
no longer any interest in a mystery which none had ever solved.

I determined at least to tell him of the two letters I had read, as well
as of the extraordinary manner in which they had disappeared, and I then
inquired if he thought they had been addressed to the woman who had died
in the house, and if there were anything in her early history which
could possibly confirm the dark suspicions to which the letters gave
rise. Mr. J---- seemed startled, and, after musing a few moments,
answered, "I am but little acquainted with the woman's earlier history,
except, as I before told you, that her family were known to mine. But
you revive some vague reminiscences to her prejudice. I will make
inquiries, and inform you of their result. Still, even if we could admit
the popular superstition that a person who had been either the
perpetrator or the victim of dark crimes in life could revisit, as a
restless spirit, the scene in which those crimes had been committed, I
should observe that the house was infested by strange sights and sounds
before the old woman died--you smile--what would you say?"

"I would say this, that I am convinced, if we could get to the bottom of
these mysteries, we should find a living human agency."

"What! you believe it is all an imposture? for what object?"

"Not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word. If suddenly I were
to sink into a deep sleep, from which you could not awake me, but in
that sleep could answer questions with an accuracy which I could not
pretend to when awake--tell you what money you had in your pocket--nay,
describe your very thoughts--it is not necessarily an imposture, any
more than it is necessarily supernatural. I should be, unconsciously to
myself, under a mesmeric influence, conveyed to me from a distance by a
human being who had acquired power over me by previous _rapport_."

"But if a mesmerizer could so affect another living being, can you
suppose that a mesmerizer could also affect inanimate objects: move
chairs--open and shut doors?"

"Or impress our senses with the belief in such effects--we never having
been _en rapport_ with the person acting on us? No. What is commonly
called mesmerism could not do this; but there may be a power akin to
mesmerism, and superior to it--the power that in the old days was called
Magic. That such a power may extend to all inanimate objects of matter I
do not say; but if so, it would not be against nature--it would be only
a rare power in nature which might be given to constitutions with
certain peculiarities, and cultivated by practice to an extraordinary
degree. That such a power might extend over the dead--that is, over
certain thoughts and memories that the dead may still retain--and
compel, not that which ought properly to be called the SOUL, and which
is far beyond human reach, but rather a phantom of what has been most
earth-stained on earth, to make itself apparent to our senses--is a very
ancient though obsolete theory, upon which I will hazard no opinion. But
I do not conceive the power would be supernatural. Let me illustrate
what I mean from an experiment which Paracelsus describes as not
difficult, and which the author of the _Curiosities of Literature_ cites
as credible:--A flower perishes; you burn it. Whatever were the elements
of that flower while it lived are gone, dispersed, you know not whither;
you can never discover nor recollect them. But you can, by chemistry,
out of the burnt dust of that flower, raise a spectrum of the flower,
just as it seemed in life. It may be the same with the human being. The
soul has as much escaped you as the essence or elements of the flower.
Still you may make a spectrum of it.

"And this phantom, though in the popular superstition it is held to be
the soul of the departed, must not be confounded with the true soul; it
is but eidolon of the dead form. Hence, like the best attested stories
of ghosts or spirits, the thing that most strikes us is the absence of
what we hold to be soul; that is, of superior emancipated intelligence.
These apparitions come for little or no object--they seldom speak when
they do come; if they speak, they utter no ideas above those of an
ordinary person on earth. American spirit-seers have published volumes
of communications in prose and verse, which they assert to be given in
the names of the most illustrious dead--Shakespeare, Bacon--heaven knows
whom. Those communications, taking the best, are certainly not a whit of
higher order than would be communications from living persons of fair
talent and education; they are wondrously inferior to what Bacon,
Shakespeare, and Plato said and wrote when on earth. Nor, what is more
noticeable, do they ever contain an idea that was not on the earth
before. Wonderful, therefore, as such phenomena may be (granting them to
be truthful), I see much that philosophy may question, nothing that it
is incumbent on philosophy to deny, viz., nothing supernatural. They are
but ideas conveyed somehow or other (we have not yet discovered the
means) from one mortal brain to another. Whether, in so doing, tables
walk of their own accord, or fiend-like shapes appear in a magic circle,
or bodyless hands rise and remove material objects, or a Thing of
Darkness, such as presented itself to me, freeze our blood--still am I
persuaded that these are but agencies conveyed, as if by electric wires,
to my own brain from the brain of another. In some constitutions there
is a natural chemistry, and these constitutions may produce chemic
wonders--in others a natural fluid, call it electricity, and these may
produce electric wonders.

"But the wonders differ from Normal Science in this--they are alike
objectless, purposeless, puerile, frivolous. They lead on to no grand
results; and therefore the world does not heed, and true sages have not
cultivated them. But sure I am, that of all I saw or heard, a man,
human as myself, was the remote originator; and I believe unconsciously
to himself as to the exact effects produced, for this reason: no two
persons, you say, have ever told you that they experienced exactly the
same thing. Well, observe, no two persons ever experience exactly the
same dream. If this were an ordinary imposture, the machinery would be
arranged for results that would but little vary; if it were a
supernatural agency permitted by the Almighty, it would surely be for
some definite end. These phenomena belong to neither class; my
persuasion is, that they originate in some brain now far distant; that
that brain had no distinct volition in anything that occurred; that what
does occur reflects but its devious, motley, ever-shifting, half-formed
thoughts; in short, that it has been but the dreams of such a brain put
into action and invested with a semi-substance. That this brain is of
immense power, that it can set matter into movement, that it is
malignant and destructive, I believe; some material force must have
killed my dog; the same force might, for aught I know, have sufficed to
kill myself, had I been as subjugated by terror as the dog--had my
intellect or my spirit given me no countervailing resistance in my
will."

"It killed your dog! that is fearful! indeed it is strange that no
animal can be induced to stay in that house; not even a cat. Rats and
mice are never found in it."

"The instincts of the brute creation detect influences deadly to their
existence. Man's reason has a sense less subtle, because it has a
resisting power more supreme. But enough; do you comprehend my theory?"

"Yes, though imperfectly--and I accept any crotchet (pardon the word),
however odd, rather than embrace at once the notion of ghosts and
hob-goblins we imbibed in our nurseries. Still, to my unfortunate house
the evil is the same. What on earth can I do with the house?"

"I will tell you what I would do. I am convinced from my own internal
feelings that the small unfurnished room at right angles to the door of
the bedroom which I occupied, forms a starting-point or receptacle for
the influences which haunt the house; and I strongly advise you to have
the walls opened, the floor removed--nay, the whole room pulled down.
I observe that it is detached from the body of the house, built over the
small back-yard, and could be removed without injury to the rest of the
building."

"And you think, if I did that----"

"You would cut off the telegraph wires. Try it. I am so persuaded that I
am right, that I will pay half the expense if you will allow me to
direct the operations."

"Nay, I am well able to afford the cost; for the rest, allow me to write
to you."

About ten days afterwards I received a letter from Mr. J----, telling me
that he had visited the house since I had seen him; that he had found
the two letters I had described replaced in the drawer from which I had
taken them; that he had read them with misgivings like my own; that he
had instituted a cautious inquiry about the woman to whom I rightly
conjectured they had been written. It seemed that thirty-six years ago
(a year before the date of the letters) she had married, against the
wish of her relations, an American of very suspicious character, in
fact, he was generally believed to have been a pirate. She herself was
the daughter of very respectable tradespeople, and had served in the
capacity of nursery governess before her marriage. She had a brother, a
widower, who was considered wealthy, and who had one child of about six
years old. A month after the marriage, the body of this brother was
found in the Thames, near London Bridge; there seemed some marks of
violence about his throat, but they were not deemed sufficient to
warrant the inquest in any other verdict than that of "found drowned."

The American and his wife took charge of the little boy, the deceased
brother having by his will left his sister the guardian of his only
child--and in the event of the child's death, the sister inherited. The
child died about six months afterwards--it was supposed to have been
neglected and ill-treated. The neighbors deposed to have heard it shriek
at night. The surgeon who had examined it after death said that it was
emaciated as if from want of nourishment, and the body was covered with
livid bruises. It seemed that one winter night the child had sought to
escape--crept out into the back-yard--tried to scale the wall--fallen
back exhausted, and been found at morning on the stones in a dying
state. But though there was some evidence of cruelty, there was none of
murder; and the aunt and her husband had sought to palliate cruelty by
alleging the exceeding stubbornness and perversity of the child, who was
declared to be half-witted. Be that is it may, at the orphan's death the
aunt inherited her brother's fortune. Before the first wedded year was
out the American quitted England abruptly, and never returned to it. He
obtained a cruising vessel, which was lost in the Atlantic two years
afterwards. The widow was left in affluence; but reverses of various
kinds had befallen her; a bank broke--an investment failed--she went
into a small business and became insolvent--then she entered into
service, sinking lower and lower, from housekeeper down to maid-of-all
work--never long retaining a place, though nothing decided against her
character was ever alleged. She was considered sober, honest, and
peculiarly quiet in her ways; still nothing prospered with her. And so
she had dropped into the workhouse, from which Mr. J---- had taken her,
to be placed in charge of the very house which she had rented as
mistress in the first year of her wedded life.

Mr. J---- added that he had passed an hour alone in the unfurnished room
which I had urged him to destroy, and that his impressions of dread
while there were so great, though he had neither heard nor seen
anything, that he was eager to have the walls bared and the floors
removed as I had suggested. He had engaged persons for the work, and
would commence any day I would name.

The day was accordingly fixed. I repaired to the haunted house--he went
into the blind dreary room, took up the skirting, and then the floors.
Under the rafters, covered with rubbish, was found a trap-door, quite
large enough to admit a man. It was closely nailed down, with clamps and
rivets of iron. On removing these we descended into a room below, the
existence of which had never been suspected. In this room there had been
a window and a flue, but they had been bricked over, evidently for many
years. By the help of candles we examined this place; it still retained
some mouldering furniture--three chairs, an oak settle, a table--all of
the fashion of about eighty years ago. There was a chest of drawers
against the wall, in which we found, half-rotted away, old-fashioned
articles of a man's dress, such as might have been worn eighty or a
hundred years ago by a gentleman of some rank--costly steel buckles and
buttons, like those yet worn in court-dresses, a handsome court
sword--in a waistcoat which had once been rich with gold-lace, but which
was now blackened and foul with damp, we found five guineas, a few
silver coins, and an ivory ticket, probably for some place of
entertainment long since passed away. But our main discovery was in a
kind of iron safe fixed to the wall, the lock of which it cost us much
trouble to get picked.

In this safe were three shelves, and two small drawers. Ranged on the
shelves were several small bottles of crystal, hermetically stopped.
They contained colorless volatile essences, of the nature of which I
shall only say that they were not poisons--phosphor and ammonia entered
into some of them. There were also some very curious glass tubes, and a
small pointed rod of iron, with a large lump of rock-crystal, and
another of amber--also a loadstone of great power.

In one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold, and
retaining the freshness of its colors most remarkably, considering the
length of time it had probably been there. The portrait was that of a
man who might be somewhat advanced in middle life, perhaps forty-seven
or forty-eight.

It was a remarkable face--a most impressive face. If you could fancy
some mighty serpent transformed into a man, preserving in the human
lineaments the old serpent type, you would have a better idea of that
countenance than long descriptions can convey: the width and flatness of
frontal--the tapering elegance of contour disguising the strength of the
deadly jaw--the long, large, terrible eye, glittering and green as the
emerald--and withal a certain ruthless calm, as if from the
consciousness of an immense power.

Mechanically I turned round the miniature to examine the back of it,
and on the back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the pentacle a
ladder, and the third step of the ladder was formed by the date 1765.
Examining still more minutely, I detected a spring; this, on being
pressed, opened the back of the miniature as a lid. Withinside the lid
were engraved, "Marianna to thee--be faithful in life and in death
to----." Here follows a name that I will not mention, but it was not
unfamiliar to me. I had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as
the name borne by a dazzling charlatan who had made a great sensation in
London for a year or so, and had fled the country on the charge of a
double murder within his own house--that of his mistress and his rival.
I said nothing of this to Mr. J----, to whom reluctantly I resigned the
miniature.

We had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the iron
safe; we found great difficulty in opening the second: it was not
locked, but it resisted all efforts, till we inserted in the clinks the
edge of a chisel. When we had thus drawn it forth we found a very
singular apparatus in the nicest order. Upon a small thin book, or
rather tablet, was placed a saucer of crystal: this saucer was filled
with a clear liquid--on that liquid floated a kind of compass, with a
needle shifting rapidly round; but instead of the usual points of a
compass were seven strange characters, not very unlike those used by
astrologers to denote the planets.

A peculiar, but not strong nor displeasing odor came from this drawer,
which was lined with a wood that we afterwards discovered to be hazel.
Whatever the cause of this odor, it produced a material effect on the
nerves. We all felt it, even the two workmen who were in the room--a
creeping tingling sensation from the tips of the fingers to the roots of
the hair. Impatient to examine the tablet, I removed the saucer. As I
did so the needle of the compass went round and round with exceeding
swiftness, and I felt a shock that ran through my whole frame, so that
I dropped the saucer on the floor. The liquid was spilt--the saucer was
broken--the compass rolled to the end of the room--and at that instant
the walls shook to and fro, as if a giant had swayed and rocked them.

The two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by which
we had descended from the trap-door; but seeing that nothing more
happened, they were easily induced to return.

Meanwhile I had opened the tablet: it was bound in plain red leather,
with a silver clasp; it contained but one sheet of thick vellum, and on
that sheet were inscribed within a double pentacle, words in old monkish
Latin, which are literally to be translated thus: "On all that it can
reach within these walls--sentient or inanimate, living or dead--as
moves the needle, so work my will! Accursed be the house, and restless
be the dwellers therein."

We found no more. Mr. J---- burnt the tablet and its anathema. He razed
to the foundations the part of the building containing the secret room
with the chamber over it. He had then the courage to inhabit the house
himself for a month, and a quieter, better-conditioned house could not
be found in all London. Subsequently he let it to advantage, and his
tenant has made no complaints.




THE SILENT WOMAN[D]

BY LEOPOLD KOMPERT


The uproarious merriment of a wedding-feast burst forth into the night
from a brilliantly lighted house in the "gasse" (narrow street). It was
one of those nights touched with the warmth of spring, but dark and full
of soft mist. Most fitting it was for a celebration of the union of two
yearning hearts to share the same lot, a lot that may possibly dawn in
sunny brightness, but also become clouded and sullen--for a long, long
time! But how merry and joyous they were over there, those people of the
happy olden times! They, like us, had their troubles and trials, and
when misfortune visited them it came not to them with soft cushions and
tender pressures of the hand. Rough and hard, with clinched fist, it
laid hold upon them. But when they gave vent to their happy feelings and
sought to enjoy themselves, they were like swimmers in cooling waters.
They struck out into the stream with freshness and courage, suffered
themselves to be borne along by the current whithersoever it took its
course. This was the cause of such a jubilee, such a thoughtlessly noisy
outburst of all kinds of soul-possessing gayety from this house of
nuptials.

"And if I had known," the bride's father, the rich Ruben Klattaner, had
just said, "that it would take the last gulden in my pocket, then out it
would have come."

In fact, it did appear as if the last groschen had really taken flight,
and was fluttering about in the form of platters heaped up with geese
and pastry-tarts. Since two o'clock--that is, since the marriage
ceremony had been performed out in the open street--until nearly
midnight, the wedding-feast had been progressing, and even yet the
_sarvers_, or waiters, were hurrying from room to room. It was as if a
twofold blessing had descended upon all this abundance of food and
drink, for, in the first place, they did not seem to diminish; secondly,
they ever found a new place for disposal. To be sure, this appetite was
sharpened by the presence of a little dwarf-like, unimportant-looking
man. He was esteemed, however, none the less highly by every one. They
had specially written to engage the celebrated "Leb Narr," of Prague.
And when was ever a mood so out of sorts, a heart so imbittered as not
to thaw out and laugh if Leb Narr played one of his pranks. Ah, thou art
now dead, good fool! Thy lips, once always ready with a witty reply, are
closed. Thy mouth, then never still, now speaks no more! But when the
hearty peals of laughter once rang forth at thy command, intercessors,
as it were, in thy behalf before the very throne of God, thou hadst
nothing to fear. And the joy of that "other" world was thine, that joy
that has ever belonged to the most pious of country rabbis!

In the mean time the young people had assembled in one of the rooms to
dance. It was strange how the sound of violins and trumpets accorded
with the drolleries of the wit from Prague. In one part the outbursts of
merriment were so boisterous that the very candles on the little table
seemed to flicker with terror; in another an ordinary conversation was
in progress, which now and then only ran over into a loud tittering,
when some old lady slipped into the circle and tried her skill at a
redowa, then altogether unknown to the young people. In the very midst
of the tangle of dancers was to be seen the bride in a heavy silk
wedding-gown. The point of her golden hood hung far down over her face.
She danced continuously. She danced with every one that asked her. Had
one, however, observed the actions of the young woman, they would
certainly have seemed to him hurried, agitated, almost wild. She looked
no one in the eye, not even her own bridegroom. He stood for the most
part in the door-way, and evidently took more pleasure in the witticisms
of the fool than in the dance or the lady dancers. But who ever thought
for a moment why the young woman's hand burned, why her breath was so
hot when one came near to her lips? Who should have noticed so strange
a thing? A low whispering already passed through the company, a stealthy
smile stole across many a lip. A bevy of ladies was seen to enter the
room suddenly. The music dashed off into one of its loudest pieces, and,
as if by enchantment, the newly made bride disappeared behind the
ladies. The bridegroom, with his stupid, smiling mien, was still left
standing on the threshold. But it was not long before he too vanished.
One could hardly say how it happened. But people understand such
skillful movements by experience, and will continue to understand them
as long as there are brides and grooms in the world.

This disappearance of the chief personages, little as it seemed to be
noticed, gave, however, the signal for general leave-taking. The dancing
became drowsy; it stopped all at once, as if by appointment. That noisy
confusion now began which always attends so merry a wedding-party.
Half-drunken voices could be heard still intermingled with a last,
hearty laugh over a joke of the fool from Prague echoing across the
table. Here and there some one, not quite sure of his balance, was
fumbling for the arm of his chair or the edge of the table. This
resulted in his overturning a dish that had been forgotten, or in
spilling a beer-glass. While this, in turn, set up a new hubbub, some
one else, in his eagerness to betake himself from the scene, fell flat
into the very dÃ©bris. But all this tumult was really hushed the moment
they all pressed to the door, for at that very instant shrieks, cries of
pain, were heard issuing from the entrance below. In an instant the
entire outpouring crowd with all possible force pushed back into the
room, but it was a long time before the stream was pressed back again.
Meanwhile, painful cries were again heard from below, so painful,
indeed, that they restored even the most drunken to a state of
consciousness.

"By the living God!" they cried to each other, "what is the matter down
there? Is the house on fire?"

"She is gone! she is gone!" shrieked a woman's voice from the entry
below.

"Who? who?" groaned the wedding-guests, seized, as it were, with an icy
horror.

"Gone! gone!" cried the woman from the entry, and hurrying up the stairs
came Selde Klattaner, the mother of the bride, pale as death, her eyes
dilated with most awful fright, convulsively grasping a candle in her
hand. "For God's sake, what has happened?" was heard on every side of
her.

The sight of so many people about her, and the confusion of voices,
seemed to release the poor woman from a kind of stupor. She glanced
shyly about her then, as if overcome with a sense of shame stronger than
her terror, and said, in a suppressed tone:

"Nothing, nothing, good people. In God's name, I ask, what was there to
happen?"

Dissimulation, however, was too evident to suffice to deceive them.

"Why, then, did you shriek so, Selde," called out one of the guests to
her, "if nothing happened?"

"Yes, she has gone," Selde now moaned in heart-rending tones, "and she
has certainly done herself some harm!"

The cause of this strange scene was now first discovered. The bride has
disappeared from the wedding-feast. Soon after that she had vanished in
such a mysterious way, the bridegroom went below to the dimly-lighted
room to find her, but in vain. At first thought this seemed to him to be
a sort of bashful jest; but not finding her here, a mysterious
foreboding seized him. He called to the mother of the bride:

"Woe to me! This woman has gone!"

Presently this party, that had so admirably controlled itself, was again
thrown into commotion. "There was nothing to do," was said on all sides,
"but to ransack every nook and corner. Remarkable instances of such
disappearances of brides had been known. Evil spirits were wont to lurk
about such nights and to inflict mankind with all sorts of sorceries."
Strange as this explanation may seem, there were many who believed it at
this very moment, and, most of all, Selde Klattaner herself. But it was
only for a moment, for she at once exclaimed:

"No, no, my good people, she is gone; I know she is gone!"

Now for the first time many of them, especially the mothers, felt
particularly uneasy, and anxiously called their daughters to them. Only
a few showed courage, and urged that they must search and search, even
if they had to turn aside the river Iser a hundred times. They urgently
pressed on, called for torches and lanterns, and started forth. The
cowardly ran after them up and down the stairs. Before any one perceived
it the room was entirely forsaken.

Ruben Klattaner stood in the hall entry below, and let the people hurry
past him without exchanging a word with any. Bitter disappointment and
fear had almost crazed him. One of the last to stay in the room above
with Selde was, strange to say, Leb Narr, of Prague. After all had
departed, he approached the miserable mother, and, in a tone least
becoming his general manner, inquired:

"Tell me, now, Mrs. Selde, did she not wish to have 'him'?"

"Whom? whom?" cried Selde, with renewed alarm, when she found herself
alone with the fool.

"I mean," said Leb, in a most sympathetic manner, approaching still
nearer to Selde, "that maybe you had to make your daughter marry him."

"Make? And have we, then, made her?" moaned Selde, staring at the fool
with a look of uncertainty.

"Then nobody needs to search for her," replied the fool, with a
sympathetic laugh, at the same time retreating. "It's better to leave
her where she is."

Without saying thanks or good-night, he was gone.

Meanwhile the cause of all this disturbance had arrived at the end of
her flight.

Close by the synagogue was situated the house of the rabbi. It was built
in an angle of a very narrow street, set in a framework of tall
shade-trees. Even by daylight it was dismal enough. At night it was
almost impossible for a timid person to approach it, for people declared
that the low supplications of the dead could be heard in the dingy house
of God when at night they took the rolls of the law from the ark to
summon their members by name.

Through this retired street passed, or rather ran, at this hour a shy
form. Arriving at the dwelling of the rabbi, she glanced backward to see
whether any one was following her. But all was silent and gloomy enough
about her. A pale light issued from one of the windows of the synagogue;
it came from the "eternal lamp" hanging in front of the ark of the
covenant. But at this moment it seemed to her as if a supernatural eye
was gazing upon her. Thoroughly affrighted, she seized the little iron
knocker of the door and struck it gently. But the throb of her beating
heart was even louder, more violent, than this blow. After a pause,
footsteps were heard passing slowly along the hallway.

The rabbi had not occupied this lonely house a long time. His
predecessor, almost a centenarian in years, had been laid to rest a few
months before. The new rabbi had been called, from a distant part of the
country. He was unmarried, and in the prime of life. No one had known
him before his coming. But his personal nobility and the profundity of
his scholarship made up for his deficiency in years. An aged mother had
accompanied him from their distant home, and she took the place of wife
and child.

"Who is there?" asked the rabbi, who had been busy at his desk even at
this late hour and thus had not missed hearing the knocker.

"It is I," the figure without responded, almost inaudibly.

"Speak louder, if you wish me to hear you," replied the rabbi.

"It is I, Ruben Klattaner's daughter," she repeated.

The name seemed to sound strange to the rabbi. He as yet knew too few of
his congregation to understand that this very day he performed the
marriage ceremony of the person who had just repeated her name.
Therefore he called out, after a moment's pause, "What do you wish so
late at night?"

"Open the door, rabbi," she answered, pleadingly, "or I shall die at
once!"

The bolt was pushed back. Something gleaming, rustling, glided past the
rabbi into the dusky hall. The light of the candle in his hand was not
sufficient to allow him to descry it. Before he had time to address her,
she had vanished past him and had disappeared through the open door
into the room. Shaking his head, the rabbi again bolted the door.

On reÃ«ntering the room he saw a woman's form sitting in the chair which
he usually occupied. She had her back turned to him. Her head was bent
low over her breast. Her golden wedding-hood, with its shading lace, was
pulled down over her forehead. Courageous and pious as the rabbi was, he
could not rid himself of a feeling of terror.

"Who are you?" he demanded, in a loud tone, as if its sound alone would
banish the presence of this being that seemed to him at this moment to
be the production of all the enchantments of evil spirits.

She raised herself, and cried in a voice that seemed to come from the
agony of a human being:

"Do you not know me--me, whom you married a few hours since under the
_chuppe_ (marriage-canopy) to a husband?"

On hearing this familiar voice the rabbi stood speechless. He gazed at
the young woman. Now, indeed, he must regard her as one bereft of
reason, rather than as a specter.

"Well, if you are she," he stammered out, after a pause, for it was with
difficulty that he found words to answer, "why are you here and not in
the place where you belong?"

"I know no other place to which I belong more than here where I now am!"
she answered, severely.

These words puzzled the rabbi still more. Is it really an insane woman
before him? He must have thought so, for he now addressed her in a
gentle tone of voice, as we do those suffering from this kind of
sickness, in order not to excite her, and said:

"The place where you belong, my daughter, is in the house of your
parents, and, since you have to-day been made a wife, your place is in
your husband's house."

The young woman muttered something which failed to reach the rabbi's
ear. Yet he only continued to think that he saw before him some poor
unfortunate whose mind was deranged. After a pause, he added, in a still
gentler tone: "What is your name, then, my child?"

"God, god," she moaned, in the greatest anguish, "he does not even yet
know my name!"

"How should I know you," he continued, apologetically, "for I am a
stranger in this place?"

This tender remark seemed to have produced the desired effect upon her
excited mind.

"My name is Veile," she said, quietly, after a pause.

The rabbi quickly perceived that he had adopted the right tone towards
his mysterious guest.

"Veile," he said, approaching nearer her, "what do you wish of me?"

"Rabbi, I have a great sin resting heavily upon my heart," she replied
despondently. "I do not know what to do."

"What can you have done," inquired the rabbi, with a tender look, "that
cannot be discussed at any other time than just now? Will you let me
advise you, Veile?"

"No, no," she cried again, violently, "I will not be advised. I see, I
know what oppresses me. Yes, I can grasp it by the hand, it lies so near
before me. Is that what you call to be advised?"

"Very well," returned the rabbi, seeing that this was the very way to
get the young woman to talk--"very well, I say, you are not imagining
anything. I believe that you have greatly sinned. Have you come here
then to confess this sin? Do your parents or your husband know anything
about it?"

"Who is my husband?" she interrupted him, impetuously.

Thoughts welled up in the rabbi's heart like a tumultuous sea in which
opposing conjectures cross and recross each other's course. Should he
speak with her as with an ordinary sinner?

"Were you, perhaps, forced to be married?" he inquired, as quietly as
possible, after a pause.

A suppressed sob, a strong inward struggle, manifesting itself in the
whole trembling body, was the only answer to this question.

"Tell me, my child," said the rabbi, encouragingly.

In such tones as the rabbi had never before heard, so strange, so
surpassing any human sounds, the young woman began:

"Yes, rabbi, I will speak, even though I know that I shall never go from
this place alive, which would be the very best thing for me! No, rabbi,
I was not forced to be married. My parents have never once said to me
'you must,' but my own will, my own desire, rather, has always been
supreme. My husband is the son of a rich man in the community. To enter
his family was to be made the first lady in the _gasse_, to sit buried
in gold and silver. And that very thing, nothing else, was what
infatuated me with him. It was for that that I forced myself, my heart
and will, to be married to him, hard as it was for me. But in my
innermost heart I detested him. The more he loved me, the more I hated
him. But the gold and silver had an influence over me. More and more
they cried to me, 'You will be the first lady in the _gasse_!'"

"Continue," said the rabbi, when she ceased, almost exhausted by these
words.

"What more shall I tell you, rabbi?" she began again. "I was never a
liar, when a child, or older, and yet during my whole engagement it has
seemed to me as if a big, gigantic lie had followed me step by step.
I have seen it on every side of me. But to-day, when I stood under the
_chuppe_, rabbi, and he took the ring from his finger and put it on
mine, and when I had to dance at my own wedding with him, whom I now
recognized, now for the first time, as the lie, and--when they led me
away----"

This sincere confession escaping from the lips of the young woman, she
sobbed aloud and bowed her head still deeper over her breast. The rabbi
gazed upon her in silence. No insane woman ever spoke like that! Only a
soul conscious of its own sin, but captivated by a mysterious power,
could suffer like this!

It was not sympathy which he felt with her; it was much more a living
over the sufferings of the woman. In spite of the confused story, it was
all clear to the rabbi. The cause of the flight from the father's house
at this hour also required no explanation. "I know what you mean," he
longed to say, but he could only find words to say: "Speak further,
Veile!"

The young woman turned towards him. He had not yet seen her face. The
golden hood with the shading lace hung deeply over it.

"Have I not told you everything?" she said, with a flush of scorn.

"Everything?" repeated the rabbi, inquiringly. He only said this,
moreover, through embarrassment.

"Do you tell me now," she cried, at once passionately and mildly, "what
am I to do?"

"Veile!" exclaimed the rabbi, entertaining now, for the first time, a
feeling of repugnance for this confidential interview.

"Tell me now!" she pleaded; and before the rabbi could prevent it the
young woman threw herself down at his feet and clasped his knees in her
arms. This hasty act had loosened the golden wedding-hood from her head,
and thus exposed her face to view, a face of remarkable beauty.

So overcome was the young rabbi by the sight of it that he had to shade
his eyes with his hands, as if before a sudden flash of lightning.

"Tell me now, what shall I do?" she cried again. "Do you think that I
have come from my parents' home merely to return again without help? You
alone in the world must tell me. Look at me! I have kept all my hair
just as God gave it me. It has never been touched by the shears. Should
I, then, do anything to please my husband? I am no wife. I will not be a
wife! Tell me, tell me, what am I to do?"

"Arise, arise," bade the rabbi; but his voice quivered, sounded almost
painful.

"Tell me first," she gasped; "I will not rise till then!"

"How can I tell you?" he moaned, almost inaudibly.

"Naphtali!" shrieked the kneeling woman.

But the rabbi staggered backward. The room seemed ablaze before him,
like a bright fire. A sharp cry rang from his breast, as if one
suffering from some painful wound had been seized by a rough hand. In
his hurried attempt to free himself from the embrace of the young
woman, who still clung to his knees, it chanced that her head struck
heavily against the floor.

"Naphtali!" she cried once again.

"Silence, silence," groaned the rabbi, pressing both hands against his
head.

And still again she called out this name, but not with that agonizing
cry. It sounded rather like a commingling of exultation and lamentation.

And again he demanded, "Silence! silence!" but this time so imperiously,
so forcibly, that the young woman lay on the floor as if conjured, not
daring to utter a single word.

The rabbi paced almost wildly up and down the room. There must have been
a hard, terrible struggle in his breast. It seemed to the one lying on
the floor that she heard him sigh from the depths of his soul. Then his
pacing became calmer; but it did not last long. The fierce conflict
again assailed him. His step grew hurried; it echoed loudly through the
awful stillness of the room. Suddenly he neared the young woman, who
seemed to lie there scarcely breathing. He stopped in front of her. Had
any one seen the face of the rabbi at this moment the expression on it
would have filled him with terror. There was a marvelous tranquillity
overlying it, the tranquillity of a struggle for life or death.

"Listen to me now, Veile," he began, slowly. "I will talk with you."

"I listen, rabbi," she whispered.

"But do you hear me well?"

"Only speak," she returned.

"But will you do what I advise you? Will you not oppose it? For I am
going to say something that will terrify you."

"I will do anything that you say. Only tell me," she moaned.

"Will you swear?"

"I will," she groaned.

"No, do not swear yet, until you have heard me," he cried. "I will not
force you."

This time came no answer.

"Hear me, then, daughter of Ruben Klattaner," he began, after a pause.
"You have a twofold sin upon your soul, and each is so great, so
criminal, that it can only be forgiven by severe punishment. First you
permitted yourself to be infatuated by the gold and silver, and then you
forced your heart to lie. With the lie you sought to deceive the man,
even though he had intrusted you with his all when he made you his wife.
A lie is truly a great sin! Streams of water cannot drown them. They
make men false and hateful to themselves. The worst that has been
committed in the world was led in by a lie. That is the one sin."

"I know, I know," sobbed the young woman.

"Now hear me further," began the rabbi again, with a wavering voice,
after a short pause. "You have committed a still greater sin than the
first. You have not only deceived your husband, but you have also
destroyed the happiness of another person. You could have spoken, and
you did not. For life you have robbed him of his happiness, his light,
his joy, but you did not speak. What can he now do, when he knows what
has been lost to him?"

"Naphtali!" cried the young woman.

"Silence! silence! do not let that name pass your lips again," he
demanded, violently. "The more you repeat it the greater becomes your
sin. Why did you not speak when you could have spoken? God can never
easily forgive you that. To be silent, to keep secret in one's breast
what would have made another man happier than the mightiest monarch!
Thereby you have made him more than unhappy. He will nevermore have the
desire to be happy. Veile, God in heaven cannot forgive you for that."

"Silence! silence!" groaned the wretched woman.

"No, Veile," he continued, with a stronger voice, "let me talk now. You
are certainly willing to hear me speak? Listen to me. You must do severe
penance for this sin, the twofold sin which rests upon your head. God is
long-suffering and merciful. He will perhaps look down upon your misery,
and will blot out your guilt from the great book of transgressions. But
you must become penitent. Hear, now, what it shall be."

The rabbi paused. He was on the point of saying the severest thing that
had ever passed his lips.

"You were silent, Veile," then he cried, "when you should have spoken.
Be silent now forever to all men and to yourself. From the moment you
leave this house, until I grant it, you must be dumb; you dare not let a
loud word pass from your mouth. Will you undergo this penance?"

"I will do all you say," moaned the young woman.

"Will you have strength to do it?" he asked, gently.

"I shall be as silent as death," she replied.

"And one thing more I have to say to you," he continued. "You are the
wife of your husband. Return home and be a Jewish wife."

"I understand you," she sobbed in reply.

"Go to your home now, and bring peace to your parents and husband. The
time will come when you may speak, when your sin will be forgiven you.
Till then bear what has been laid upon you."

"May I say one thing more?" she cried, lifting up her head.

"Speak," he said.

"Naphtali!"

The rabbi covered his eyes with one hand, with the other motioned her to
be silent. But she grasped his hand, drew it to her lips. Hot tears fell
upon it.

"Go now," he sobbed, completely broken down.

She let go the hand. The rabbi had seized the candle, but she had
already passed him, and glided through the dark hall. The door was left
open. The rabbi locked it again.

       *       *       *       *       *

Veile returned to her home, as she had escaped, unnoticed. The narrow
street was deserted, as desolate as death. The searchers were to be
found everywhere except there where they ought first to have sought for
the missing one. Her mother, Selde, still sat on the same chair on which
she had sunk down an hour ago. The fright had left her like one
paralyzed, and she was unable to rise. What a wonderful contrast this
wedding-room, with the mother sitting alone in it, presented to the
hilarity reigning here shortly before! On Veile's entrance her mother
did not cry out. She had no strength to do so. She merely said: "So you
have come at last, my daughter?" as if Veile had only returned from a
walk somewhat too long. But the young woman did not answer to this and
similar questions. Finally she signified by gesticulations that she
could not speak. Fright seized the wretched mother a second time, and
the entire house was filled with her lamentations.

Ruben Klattaner and Veile's husband having now returned from their
fruitless search, were horrified on perceiving the change which Veile
had undergone. Being men, they did not weep. With staring eyes they
gazed upon the silent young woman, and beheld in her an apparition which
had been dealt with by God's visitation in a mysterious manner.

From this hour began the terrible penance of the young woman.

The impression which Veile's woeful condition made upon the people of
the _gasse_ was wonderful. Those who had danced with her that evening on
the wedding now first recalled her excited state. Her wild actions were
now first remembered by many. It must have been an "evil eye," they
concluded--a jealous, evil eye, to which her beauty was hateful. This
alone could have possessed her with a demon of unrest. She was driven by
this evil power into the dark night, a sport of these malicious
potencies which pursue men step by step, especially on such occasions.
The living God alone knows what she must have seen that night. Nothing
good, else one would not become dumb. Old legends and tales were
revived, each more horrible than the other. Hundreds of instances were
given to prove that this was nothing new in the _gasse_. Despite this
explanation, it is remarkable that the people did not believe that the
young woman was dumb. The most thought that her power of speech had been
paralyzed by some awful fright, but that with time it would be restored.
Under this supposition they called her "Veile the Silent."

There is a kind of human eloquence more telling, more forcible than the
loudest words, than the choicest diction--the silence of woman!
Ofttimes they cannot endure the slightest vexation, but some great,
heart-breaking sorrow, some pain from constant renunciation,
self-sacrifice, they suffer with sealed lips--as if, in very truth, they
were bound with bars of iron.

It would be difficult to fully describe that long "silent" life of the
young woman. It is almost impossible to cite more than one incident.
Veile accompanied her husband to his home, that house resplendent with
that gold and silver which had infatuated her. She was, to be sure, the
"first" woman in the _gasse_; she had everything in abundance. Indeed,
the world supposed that she had but little cause for complaint. "Must
one have everything?" was sometimes queried in the _gasse_. "One has one
thing; another, another." And, according to all appearances, the people
were right. Veile continued to be the beautiful, blooming woman. Her
penance of silence did not deprive her of a single charm. She was so
very happy, indeed, that she did not seem to feel even the pain of her
punishment. Veile could laugh and rejoice, but never did she forget to
be silent. The seemingly happy days, however, were only qualified to
bring about the proper time of trials and temptations. The beginning was
easy enough for her, the middle and end were times of real pain. The
first years of their wedded life were childless. "It is well," the
people in the _gasse_ said, "that she has no children, and God has
rightly ordained it to be so. A mother who cannot talk to her child,
that would be something awful!" Unexpectedly to all, she rejoiced one
day in the birth of a daughter. And when that affectionate young
creature, her own offspring, was laid upon her breast, and the first
sounds were uttered by its lips--that nameless, eloquent utterance of an
infant--she forgot herself not; she was silent!

She was silent also when from day to day that child blossomed before her
eyes into fuller beauty. Nor had she any words for it when, in effusions
of tenderness, it stretched forth its tiny arms, when in burning fever
it sought for the mother's hand. For days--yes, weeks--together she
watched at its bedside. Sleep never visited her eyes. But she ever
remembered her penance.

Years fled by. In her arms she carried another child. It was a boy. The
father's joy was great. The child inherited its mother's beauty. Like
its sister, it grew in health and strength. The noblest, richest mother,
they said, might be proud of such children! And Veile was proud, no
doubt, but this never passed her lips. She remained silent about things
which mothers in their joy often cannot find words enough to express.
And although her face many times lighted up with beaming smiles, yet she
never renounced the habitual silence imposed upon her.

The idea that the slightest dereliction of her penance would be
accompanied with a curse upon her children may have impressed itself
upon her mind. Mothers will understand better than other persons what
this mother suffered from her penalty of silence.

Thus a part of those years sped away which we are wont to call the best.
She still flourished in her wonderful beauty. Her maiden daughter was
beside her, like the bud beside the full-blown rose. Suitors were
already present from far and near, who passed in review before the
beautiful girl. The most of them were excellent young men, and any
mother might have been proud in having her own daughter sought by such.
Even then Veile did not undo her penance. Those busy times of
intercourse which keep mothers engaged in presenting the superiorities
of their daughters in the best light were not allowed her. The choice of
one of the most favored suitors was made. Never before did any couple in
the _gasse_ equal this in beauty and grace. A few weeks before the
appointed time for the wedding a malignant disease stole on, spreading
sorrow and anxiety over the greater part of the land. Young girls were
principally its victims. It seemed to pass scornfully over the aged and
infirm. Veile's daughter was also laid hold upon by it. Before three
days had passed there was a corpse in the house--the bride!

Even then Veile did not forget her penance. When they bore away the
corpse to the "good place," she did utter a cry of anguish which long
after echoed in the ears of the people; she did wring her hands in
despair, but no one heard a word of complaint. Her lips seemed dumb
forever. It was then, when she was seated on the low stool in the seven
days of mourning, that the rabbi came to her, to bring to her the usual
consolation for the dead. But he did not speak with her. He addressed
words only to her husband. She herself dared not look up. Only when he
turned to go did she lift her eyes. They, in turn, met the eyes of the
rabbi, but he departed without a farewell.

After her daughter's death Veile was completely broken down. Even that
which at her time of life is still called beauty had faded away within a
few days. Her cheeks had become hollow, her hair gray. Visitors wondered
how she could endure such a shock, how body and spirit could hold
together. They did not know that that silence was an iron fetter firmly
imprisoning the slumbering spirits. She had a son, moreover, to whom, as
to something last and dearest, her whole being still clung.

The boy was thirteen years old. His learning in the Holy Scriptures was
already celebrated for miles around. He was the pupil of the rabbi, who
had treated him with a love and tenderness becoming his own father. He
said that he was a remarkable child, endowed with rare talents. The boy
was to be sent to Hungary, to one of the most celebrated teachers of the
times, in order to lay the foundation for his sacred studies under this
instructor's guidance and wisdom. Years might perhaps pass before she
would see him again. But Veile let her boy go from her embrace. She did
not say a blessing over him when he went; only her lips twitched with
the pain of silence.

Long years expired before the boy returned from the strange land, a
full-grown, noble youth. When Veile had her son with her again a smile
played about her mouth, and for a moment it seemed as if her former
beauty had enjoyed a second spring. The extraordinary ability of her son
already made him famous. Wheresoever he went people were delighted with
his beauty, and admired the modesty of his manner, despite such great
scholarship.

The next Sabbath the young disciple of the Talmud, scarcely twenty years
of age, was to demonstrate the first marks of this great learning.

The people crowded shoulder to shoulder in this great synagogue. Curious
glances were cast through the lattice-work of the women's gallery above
upon the dense throng. Veile occupied one of the foremost seats. She
could see everything that took place below. Her face was extremely pale.
All eyes were turned towards her--the mother, who was permitted to see
such a day for her son! But Veile did not appear to notice what was
happening before her. A weariness, such as she had never felt before,
even in her greatest suffering, crept over her limbs. It was as if she
must sleep during her son's address. He had hardly mounted the stairs
before the ark of the laws--hardly uttered his first words--when a
remarkable change crossed her face. Her cheeks burned. She arose. All
her vital energy seemed aroused. Her son meanwhile was speaking down
below. She could not have told what he was saying. She did not hear
him--she only heard the murmur of approbation, sometimes low, sometimes
loud, which came to her ears from the quarters of the men. The people
were astonished at the noble bearing of the speaker, his melodious
speech, and his powerful energy. When he stopped at certain times to
rest it seemed as if one were in a wood swept by a storm. She could now
and then hear a few voices declaring that such a one had never before
been listened to. The women at her side wept; she alone could not. A
choking pain pressed from her breast to her lips. Forces were astir in
her heart which struggled for expression. The whole synagogue echoed
with buzzing voices, but to her it seemed as if she must speak louder
than these. At the very moment her son had ended she cried out
unconsciously, violently throwing herself against the lattice-work:

"God! living God! shall I not now speak?" A dead silence followed this
outcry. Nearly all had recognized this voice as that of the "silent
woman." A miracle had taken place!

"Speak! speak!" resounded the answer of the rabbi from the men's seats
below. "You may now speak!"

But no reply came. Veile had fallen back into her seat, pressing both
hands against her breast. When the women sitting beside her looked at
her they were terrified to find that the "silent woman" had fainted.
She was dead! The unsealing of her lips was her last moment.

Long years afterwards the rabbi died. On his death-bed he told those
standing about him this wonderful penance of Veile.

Every girl in the _gasse_ knew the story of the "silent woman."

BANSHEES[E]

Of all Irish ghosts, fairies, or bogles, the Banshee (sometimes called
locally the "Boh[=ee]ntha" or "Bank[=ee]ntha") is the best known to the
general public: indeed, cross-Channel visitors would class her with
pigs, potatoes, and other fauna and flora of Ireland, and would expect
her to make manifest her presence to them as being one of the sights of
the country. She is a spirit with a lengthy pedigree--how lengthy no man
can say, as its roots go back into the dim, mysterious past. The most
famous Banshee of ancient times was that attached to the kingly house of
O'Brien, Aibhill, who haunted the rock of Craglea above Killaloe, near
the old palace of Kincora. In A.D. 1014 was fought the battle of
Clontarf, from which the aged king, Brian Boru, knew that he would never
come away alive, for the previous night Aibhill had appeared to him to
tell him of his impending fate. The Banshee's method of foretelling
death in olden times differed from that adopted by her at the present
day: now she wails and wrings her hands, as a general rule, but in the
old Irish tales she is to be found washing human heads and limbs, or
blood-stained clothes, till the water is all dyed with human blood--this
would take place before a battle. So it would seem that in the course of
centuries her attributes and characteristics have changed somewhat.

Very different descriptions are given of her personal appearance.
Sometimes she is young and beautiful, sometimes old and of a fearsome
appearance. One writer describes her as "a tall, thin woman with
uncovered head, and long hair that floated round her shoulders, attired
in something which seemed either a loose white cloak, or a sheet thrown
hastily around her, uttering piercing cries." Another person, a
coachman, saw her one evening sitting on a stile in the yard; she seemed
to be a very small woman, with blue eyes, long light hair, and wearing
a red cloak. Other descriptions will be found in this chapter. By the
way, it does not seem to be true that the Banshee exclusively follows
families of Irish descent, for the last incident had reference to the
death of a member of a Co. Galway family English by name and origin.

One of the oldest and best-known Banshee stories is that related in the
_Memoirs_ of Lady Fanshaw.[F] In 1642 her husband, Sir Richard, and she
chanced to visit a friend, the head of an Irish sept, who resided in his
ancient baronial castle, surrounded with a moat. At midnight she was
awakened by a ghastly and supernatural scream, and looking out of bed,
beheld in the moonlight a female face and part of the form hovering at
the window. The distance from the ground, as well as the circumstance of
the moat, excluded the possibility that what she beheld was of this
world. The face was that of a young and rather handsome woman, but pale,
and the hair, which was reddish, was loose and disheveled. The dress,
which Lady Fanshaw's terror did not prevent her remarking accurately,
was that of the ancient Irish. This apparition continued to exhibit
itself for some time, and then vanished with two shrieks similar to that
which had first excited Lady Fanshaw's attention. In the morning, with
infinite terror, she communicated to her host what she had witnessed,
and found him prepared not only to credit, but to account for the
superstition. "A near relation of my family," said he; "expired last
night in this castle. We disguised our certain expectation of the event
from you, lest it should throw a cloud over the cheerful reception which
was your due. Now, before such an event happens in this family or
castle, the female specter whom you have seen is always visible. She is
believed to be the spirit of a woman of inferior rank, whom one of my
ancestors degraded himself by marrying, and whom afterwards, to expiate
the dishonor done to his family, he caused to be drowned in the moat."
In strictness this woman could hardly be termed a Banshee. The motive
for the haunting is akin to that in the tale of the Scotch "Drummer of
Cortachy," where the spirit of the murdered man haunts the family out of
revenge, and appears before a death.

Mr. T.J. Westropp, M.A., has furnished the following story: "My maternal
grandmother heard the following tradition from her mother, one of the
Miss Ross-Lewins, who witnessed the occurrence. Their father, Mr.
Harrison Ross-Lewin, was away in Dublin on law business, and in his
absence the young people went off to spend the evening with a friend who
lived some miles away. The night was fine and lightsome as they were
returning, save at one point where the road ran between trees or high
hedges not far to the west of the old church of Kilchrist. The latter,
like many similar ruins, was a simple oblong building, with long
side-walls and high gables, and at that time it and its graveyard were
unenclosed, and lay in the open fields. As the party passed down the
long dark lane they suddenly heard in the distance loud keening and
clapping of hands, as the country-people were accustomed to do when
lamenting the dead. The Ross-Lewins hurried on, and came in sight of the
church, on the side wall of which a little gray-haired old woman, clad
in a dark cloak, was running to and fro, chanting and wailing, and
throwing up her arms. The girls were very frightened, but the young men
ran forward and surrounded the ruin, and two of them went into the
church, the apparition vanishing from the wall as they did so. They
searched every nook, and found no one, nor did any one pass out. All
were now well scared, and got home as fast as possible. On reaching
their home their mother opened the door, and at once told them that she
was in terror about their father, for, as she sat looking out the window
in the moonlight, a huge raven with fiery eyes lit on the sill, and
tapped three times on the glass. They told her their story, which only
added to their anxiety, and as they stood talking, taps came to the
nearest window, and they saw the bird again. A few days later news
reached them that Mr. Ross-Lewin had died suddenly in Dublin. This
occurred about 1776."

Mr. Westropp also writes that the sister of a former Roman Catholic
Bishop told his sisters that when she was a little girl she went out
one evening with some other children for a walk. Going down the road,
they passed the gate of the principal demesne near the town. There was a
rock, or large stone, beside the road, on which they saw something.
Going nearer, they perceived it to be a little dark, old woman, who
began crying and clapping her hands. Some of them attempted to speak to
her, but got frightened, and all finally ran home as quickly as they
could. Next day the news came that the gentleman near whose gate the
Banshee had cried, was dead, and it was found on inquiry that he had
died at the very hour at which the children had seen the specter.

A lady who is a relation of one of the compilers, and a member of a Co.
Cork family of English descent, sends the two following experiences of a
Banshee in her family. "My mother, when a young girl, was standing
looking out of the window in their house at Blackrock, near Cork. She
suddenly saw a white figure standing on a bridge which was easily
visible from the house. The figure waved her arms towards the house, and
my mother heard the bitter wailing of the Banshee. It lasted some
seconds, and then the figure disappeared. Next morning my grandfather
was walking as usual into the city of Cork. He accidentally fell, hit
his head against the curbstone, and never recovered consciousness.

"In March, 1900, my mother was very ill, and one evening the nurse and I
were with her arranging her bed. We suddenly heard the most extraordinary
wailing, which seemed to come in waves round and under her bed. We
naturally looked everywhere to try and find the cause, but in vain. The
nurse and I looked at one another, but made no remark, as my mother did
not seem to hear it. My sister was downstairs sitting with my father.
She heard it, and thought some terrible thing had happened to her little
boy, who was in bed upstairs. She rushed up, and found him sleeping
quietly. My father did not hear it. In the house next door they heard
it, and ran downstairs, thinking something had happened to the servant;
but the latter at once said to them, 'Did you hear the Banshee? Mrs.
P---- must be dying.'"

A few years ago (_i.e._ before 1894) a curious incident occurred in a
public school in connection with the belief in the Banshee. One of the
boys, happening to become ill, was at once placed in a room by himself,
where he used to sit all day. On one occasion, as he was being visited
by the doctor, he suddenly started up from his seat, and affirmed that
he heard somebody crying. The doctor, of course, who could hear or see
nothing, came to the conclusion that the illness had slightly affected
his brain. However, the boy, who appeared quite sensible, still
persisted that he heard some one crying, and furthermore said, "It is
the Banshee, as I have heard it before." The following morning the
head-master received a telegram saying that the boy's brother had been
accidentally shot dead.[G]

That the Banshee is not confined within the geographical limits of
Ireland, but that she can follow the fortunes of a family abroad, and
there foretell their death, is clearly shown by the following story. A
party of visitors were gathered together on the deck of a private yacht
on one of the Italian lakes, and during a lull in the conversation one
of them, a Colonel, said to the owner, "Count, who's that queer-looking
woman you have on board?" The Count replied that there was nobody except
the ladies present, and the stewardess, but the speaker protested that
he was correct, and suddenly, with a scream of horror, he placed his
hands before his eyes, and exclaimed, "Oh, my God, what a face!" For
some time he was overcome with terror, and at length reluctantly looked
up, and cried:

"Thank Heavens, it's gone!"

"What was it?" asked the Count.

"Nothing human," replied the Colonel--"nothing belonging to this world.
It was a woman of no earthly type, with a queer-shaped, gleaming face, a
mass of red hair, and eyes that would have been beautiful but for their
expression, which was hellish. She had on a green hood, after the
fashion of an Irish peasant."

An American lady present suggested that the description tallied with
that of the Banshee, upon which the Count said:

"I am an O'Neill--at least I am descended from one. My family name is,
as you know, Neilsini, which, little more than a century ago, was
O'Neill. My great-grandfather served in the Irish Brigade, and on its
dissolution at the time of the French Revolution had the good fortune to
escape the general massacre of officers, and in company with an O'Brien
and a Maguire fled across the frontier and settled in Italy. On his
death his son, who had been born in Italy, and was far more Italian than
Irish, changed his name to Neilsini, by which name the family has been
known ever since. But for all that we are Irish."

"The Banshee was yours, then!" ejaculated the Colonel. "What exactly
does it mean?"

"It means," the Count replied solemnly, "the death of some one very
nearly associated with me. Pray Heaven it is not my wife or daughter."

On that score, however, his anxiety was speedily removed, for within two
hours he was seized with a violent attack of angina pectoris, and died
before morning.[H]

Mr. Elliott O'Donnell, to whose article on "Banshees" we are indebted
for the above, adds: "The Banshee never manifests itself to the person
whose death it is prognosticating. Other people may see or hear it, but
the fated one never, so that when every one present is aware of it but
one, the fate of that one may be regarded as pretty well certain."

THE MAN WHO WENT TOO FAR

BY E.F. BENSON


The little village of St. Faith's nestles in a hollow of wooded hill up
on the north bank of the river Fawn in the county of Hampshire, huddling
close round its gray Norman church as if for spiritual protection
against the fays and fairies, the trolls and "little people," who might
be supposed still to linger in the vast empty spaces of the New Forest,
and to come after dusk and do their doubtful businesses. Once outside
the hamlet you may walk in any direction (so long as you avoid the high
road which leads to Brockenhurst) for the length of a summer afternoon
without seeing sign of human habitation, or possibly even catching sight
of another human being. Shaggy wild ponies may stop their feeding for a
moment as you pass, the white scuts of rabbits will vanish into their
burrows, a brown viper perhaps will glide from your path into a clump of
heather, and unseen birds will chuckle in the bushes, but it may easily
happen that for a long day you will see nothing human. But you will not
feel in the least lonely; in summer, at any rate, the sunlight will be
gay with butterflies, and the air thick with all those woodland sounds
which like instruments in an orchestra combine to play the great
symphony of the yearly festival of June. Winds whisper in the birches,
and sigh among the firs; bees are busy with their redolent labor among
the heather, a myriad birds chirp in the green temples of the forest
trees, and the voice of the river prattling over stony places, bubbling
into pools, chuckling and gulping round corners, gives you the sense
that many presences and companions are near at hand.

Yet, oddly enough, though one would have thought that these benign and
cheerful influences of wholesome air and spaciousness of forest were
very healthful comrades for a man, in so far as nature can really
influence this wonderful human genus which has in these centuries
learned to defy her most violent storms in its well-established houses,
to bridle her torrents and make them light its streets, to tunnel her
mountains and plow her seas, the inhabitants of St. Faith's will not
willingly venture into the forest after dark. For in spite of the
silence and loneliness of the hooded night it seems that a man is not
sure in what company he may suddenly find himself, and though it is
difficult to get from these villagers any very clear story of occult
appearances, the feeling is widespread. One story indeed I have heard
with some definiteness, the tale of a monstrous goat that has been seen
to skip with hellish glee about the woods and shady places, and this
perhaps is connected with the story which I have here attempted to piece
together. It too is well-known to them; for all remember the young
artist who died here not long ago, a young man, or so he struck the
beholder, of great personal beauty, with something about him that made
men's faces to smile and brighten when they looked on him. His ghost
they will tell you "walks" constantly by the stream and through the
woods which he loved so, and in especial it haunts a certain house, the
last of the village, where he lived, and its garden in which he was done
to death. For my part I am inclined to think that the terror of the
Forest dates chiefly from that day. So, such as the story is, I have set
it forth in connected form. It is based partly on the accounts of the
villagers, but mainly on that of Darcy, a friend of mine and a friend of
the man with whom these events were chiefly concerned.

       *       *       *       *       *

The day had been one of untarnished midsummer splendor, and as the sun
drew near to its setting, the glory of the evening grew every moment
more crystalline, more miraculous. Westward from St. Faith's the
beechwood which stretched for some miles toward the heathery upland
beyond already cast its veil of clear shadow over the red roofs of the
village, but the spire of the gray church, over-topping all, still
pointed a flaming orange finger into the sky. The river Fawn, which runs
below, lay in sheets of sky-reflected blue, and wound its dreamy devious
course round the edge of this wood, where a rough two-planked bridge
crossed from the bottom of the garden of the last house in the village,
and communicated by means of a little wicker gate with the wood itself.
Then once out of the shadow of the wood the stream lay in flaming pools
of the molten crimson of the sunset, and lost itself in the haze of
woodland distances.

This house at the end of the village stood outside the shadow, and the
lawn which sloped down to the river was still flecked with sunlight.
Garden-beds of dazzling color lined its gravel walks, and down the
middle of it ran a brick pergola, half-hidden in clusters of
rambler-rose and purple with starry clematis. At the bottom end of it,
between two of its pillars, was slung a hammock containing a
shirt-sleeved figure.

The house itself lay somewhat remote from the rest of the village, and a
footpath leading across two fields, now tall and fragrant with hay, was
its only communication with the high road. It was low-built, only two
stories in height, and like the garden, its walls were a mass of
flowering roses. A narrow stone terrace ran along the garden front, over
which was stretched an awning, and on the terrace a young silent-footed
man-servant was busied with the laying of the table for dinner. He was
neat-handed and quick with his job, and having finished it he went back
into the house, and reappeared again with a large rough bath-towel on
his arm. With this he went to the hammock in the pergola.

"Nearly eight, sir," he said.

"Has Mr. Darcy come yet?" asked a voice from the hammock.

"No, sir."

"If I'm not back when he comes, tell him that I'm just having a bathe
before dinner."

The servant went back to the house, and after a moment or two Frank
Halton struggled to a sitting posture, and slipped out on to the grass.
He was of medium height and rather slender in build, but the supple ease
and grace of his movements gave the impression of great physical
strength: even his descent from the hammock was not an awkward
performance. His face and hands were of very dark complexion, either
from constant exposure to wind and sun, or, as his black hair and dark
eyes tended to show, from some strain of southern blood. His head was
small, his face of an exquisite beauty of modeling, while the smoothness
of its contour would have led you to believe that he was a beardless lad
still in his teens. But something, some look which living and experience
alone can give, seemed to contradict that, and finding yourself
completely puzzled as to his age, you would next moment probably cease
to think about that, and only look at this glorious specimen of young
manhood with wondering satisfaction.

He was dressed as became the season and the heat, and wore only a shirt
open at the neck, and a pair of flannel trousers. His head, covered very
thickly with a somewhat rebellious crop of short curly hair, was bare as
he strolled across the lawn to the bathing-place that lay below. Then
for a moment there was silence, then the sound of splashed and divided
waters, and presently after, a great shout of ecstatic joy, as he swam
up-stream with the foamed water standing in a frill round his neck. Then
after some five minutes of limb-stretching struggle with the flood, he
turned over on his back, and with arms thrown wide, floated down-stream,
ripple-cradled and inert. His eyes were shut, and between half-parted
lips he talked gently to himself.

"I am one with it," he said to himself, "the river and I, I and the
river. The coolness and splash of it is I, and the water-herbs that wave
in it are I also. And my strength and my limbs are not mine but the
river's. It is all one, all one, dear Fawn."

       *       *       *       *       *

A quarter of an hour later he appeared again at the bottom of the lawn,
dressed as before, his wet hair already drying into its crisp short
curls again. There he paused a moment, looking back at the stream with
the smile with which men look on the face of a friend, then turned
towards the house. Simultaneously his servant came to the door leading
on to the terrace, followed by a man who appeared to be some half-way
through the fourth decade of his years. Frank and he saw each other
across the bushes and garden-beds, and each quickening his step, they
met suddenly face to face round an angle of the garden walk, in the
fragrance of syringa.

"My dear Darcy," cried Frank, "I am charmed to see you."

But the other stared at him in amazement.

"Frank!" he exclaimed.

"Yes, that is my name," he said laughing, "what is the matter?"

Darcy took his hand.

"What have you done to yourself?" he asked. "You are a boy again."

"Ah, I have a lot to tell you," said Frank. "Lots that you will hardly
believe, but I shall convince you----"

He broke off suddenly, and held up his hand.

"Hush, there is my nightingale," he said.

The smile of recognition and welcome with which he had greeted his
friend faded from his face, and a look of rapt wonder took its place, as
of a lover listening to the voice of his beloved. His mouth parted
slightly, showing the white line of teeth, and his eyes looked out and
out till they seemed to Darcy to be focused on things beyond the vision
of man. Then something perhaps startled the bird, for the song ceased.

"Yes, lots to tell you," he said. "Really I am delighted to see you. But
you look rather white and pulled down; no wonder after that fever. And
there is to be no nonsense about this visit. It is June now, you stop
here till you are fit to begin work again. Two months at least."

"Ah, I can't trespass quite to that extent."

Frank took his arm and walked him down the grass.

"Trespass? Who talks of trespass? I shall tell you quite openly when I
am tired of you, but you know when we had the studio together, we used
not to bore each other. However, it is ill talking of going away on the
moment of your arrival. Just a stroll to the river, and then it will be
dinner-time."

Darcy took out his cigarette case, and offered it to the other.

Frank laughed.

"No, not for me. Dear me, I suppose I used to smoke once. How very odd!"

"Given it up?"

"I don't know. I suppose I must have. Anyhow I don't do it now. I would
as soon think of eating meat."

"Another victim on the smoking altar of vegetarianism?"

"Victim?" asked Frank. "Do I strike you as such?"

He paused on the margin of the stream and whistled softly. Next moment a
moor-hen made its splashing flight across the river, and ran up the
bank. Frank took it very gently in his hands and stroked its head, as
the creature lay against his shirt.

"And is the house among the reeds still secure?" he half-crooned to it.
"And is the missus quite well, and are the neighbors flourishing? There,
dear, home with you," and he flung it into the air.

"That bird's very tame," said Darcy, slightly bewildered.

"It is rather," said Frank, following its flight.

       *       *       *       *       *

During dinner Frank chiefly occupied himself in bringing himself
up-to-date in the movements and achievements of this old friend whom he
had not seen for six years. Those six years, it now appeared, had been
full of incident and success for Darcy; he had made a name for himself
as a portrait painter which bade fair to outlast the vogue of a couple
of seasons, and his leisure time had been brief. Then some four months
previously he had been through a severe attack of typhoid, the result of
which as concerns this story was that he had come down to this
sequestered place to recruit.

"Yes, you've got on," said Frank at the end. "I always knew you would.
A.R.A. with more in prospect. Money? You roll in it, I suppose, and, O
Darcy, how much happiness have you had all these years? That is the only
imperishable possession. And how much have you learned? Oh, I don't mean
in Art. Even I could have done well in that."

Darcy laughed.

"Done well? My dear fellow, all I have learned in these six years you
knew, so to speak, in your cradle. Your old pictures fetch huge prices.
Do you never paint now?"

Frank shook his head.

"No, I'm too busy," he said.

"Doing what? Please tell me. That is what every one is for ever asking
me."

"Doing? I suppose you would say I do nothing."

Darcy glanced up at the brilliant young face opposite him.

"It seems to suit you, that way of being busy," he said. "Now, it's your
turn. Do you read? Do you study? I remember you saying that it would do
us all--all us artists, I mean--a great deal of good if we would study
any one human face carefully for a year, without recording a line. Have
you been doing that?"

Frank shook his head again.

"I mean exactly what I say," he said, "I have been _doing_ nothing. And
I have never been so occupied. Look at me; have I not done something to
myself to begin with?"

"You are two years younger than I," said Darcy, "at least you used to
be. You therefore are thirty-five. But had I never seen you before I
should say you were just twenty. But was it worth while to spend six
years of greatly-occupied life in order to look twenty? Seems rather
like a woman of fashion."

Frank laughed boisterously.

"First time I've ever been compared to that particular bird of prey," he
said. "No, that has not been my occupation--in fact I am only very
rarely conscious that one effect of my occupation has been that. Of
course, it must have been if one comes to think of it. It is not very
important. Quite true my body has become young. But that is very little;
I have become young."

Darcy pushed back his chair and sat sideways to the table looking at the
other.

"Has that been your occupation then?" he asked.

"Yes, that anyhow is one aspect of it. Think what youth means! It is the
capacity for growth, mind, body, spirit, all grow, all get stronger, all
have a fuller, firmer life every day. That is something, considering
that every day that passes after the ordinary man reaches the
full-blown flower of his strength, weakens his hold on life. A man
reaches his prime, and remains, we say, in his prime, for ten years, or
perhaps twenty. But after his primest prime is reached, he slowly,
insensibly weakens. These are the signs of age in you, in your body, in
your art probably, in your mind. You are less electric than you were.
But I, when I reach my prime--I am nearing it--ah, you shall see."

The stars had begun to appear in the blue velvet of the sky, and to the
east the horizon seen above the black silhouette of the village was
growing dove-colored with the approach of moon-rise. White moths hovered
dimly over the garden-beds, and the footsteps of night tip-toed through
the bushes. Suddenly Frank rose.

"Ah, it is the supreme moment," he said softly. "Now more than at any
other time the current of life, the eternal imperishable current runs so
close to me that I am almost enveloped in it. Be silent a minute."

He advanced to the edge of the terrace and looked out standing stretched
with arms outspread. Darcy heard him draw a long breath into his lungs,
and after many seconds expel it again. Six or eight times he did this,
then turned back into the lamplight.

"It will sound to you quite mad, I expect," he said, "but if you want to
hear the soberest truth I have ever spoken and shall ever speak, I will
tell you about myself. But come into the garden if it is not too damp
for you. I have never told any one yet, but I shall like to tell you. It
is long, in fact, since I have even tried to classify what I have
learned."

They wandered into the fragrant dimness of the pergola, and sat down.
Then Frank began:

"Years ago, do you remember," he said, "we used often to talk about the
decay of joy in the world. Many impulses, we settled, had contributed to
this decay, some of which were good in themselves, others that were
quite completely bad. Among the good things, I put what we may call
certain Christian virtues, renunciation, resignation, sympathy with
suffering, and the desire to relieve sufferers. But out of those things
spring very bad ones, useless renunciations, asceticism for its own
sake, mortification of the flesh with nothing to follow, no
corresponding gain that is, and that awful and terrible disease which
devastated England some centuries ago, and from which by heredity of
spirit we suffer now, Puritanism. That was a dreadful plague, the brutes
held and taught that joy and laughter and merriment were evil: it was a
doctrine the most profane and wicked. Why, what is the commonest crime
one sees? A sullen face. That is the truth of the matter.

"Now all my life I have believed that we are intended to be happy, that
joy is of all gifts the most divine. And when I left London, abandoned
my career, such as it was, I did so because I intended to devote my life
to the cultivation of joy, and, by continuous and unsparing effort, to
be happy. Among people, and in constant intercourse with others, I did
not find it possible; there were too many distractions in towns and
work-rooms, and also too much suffering. So I took one step backwards or
forwards, as you may choose to put it, and went straight to Nature, to
trees, birds, animals, to all those things which quite clearly pursue
one aim only, which blindly follow the great native instinct to be
happy without any care at all for morality, or human law or divine law.
I wanted, you understand, to get all joy first-hand and unadulterated,
and I think it scarcely exists among men; it is obsolete."

Darcy turned in his chair.

"Ah, but what makes birds and animals happy?" he asked. "Food, food and
mating."

Frank laughed gently in the stillness.

"Do not think I became a sensualist," he said. "I did not make that
mistake. For the sensualist carries his miseries pick-a-back, and round
his feet is wound the shroud that shall soon enwrap him. I may be mad,
it is true, but I am not so stupid anyhow as to have tried that. No,
what is it that makes puppies play with their own tails, that sends cats
on their prowling ecstatic errands at night?".

He paused a moment.

"So I went to Nature," he said. "I sat down here in this New Forest,
sat down fair and square, and looked. That was my first difficulty, to
sit here quiet without being bored, to wait without being impatient, to
be receptive and very alert, though for a long time nothing particular
happened. The change in fact was slow in those early stages."

"Nothing happened?" asked Darcy rather impatiently, with the sturdy
revolt against any new idea which to the English mind is synonymous with
nonsense. "Why, what in the world _should_ happen?"

Now Frank as he had known him was the most generous but most
quick-tempered of mortal men; in other words his anger would flare to a
prodigious beacon, under almost no provocation, only to be quenched
again under a gust of no less impulsive kindliness. Thus the moment
Darcy had spoken, an apology for his hasty question was half-way up his
tongue. But there was no need for it to have traveled even so far, for
Frank laughed again with kindly, genuine mirth.

"Oh, how I should have resented that a few years ago," he said. "Thank
goodness that resentment is one of the things I have got rid of.
I certainly wish that you should believe my story--in fact, you are
going to--but that you at this moment should imply that you do not,
does not concern me."

"Ah, your solitary sojournings have made you inhuman," said Darcy, still
very English.

"No, human," said Frank. "Rather more human, at least rather less of an
ape."

"Well, that was my first quest," he continued, after a moment, "the
deliberate and unswerving pursuit of joy, and my method, the eager
contemplation of Nature. As far as motive went, I daresay it was purely
selfish, but as far as effect goes, it seems to me about the best thing
one can do for one's fellow-creatures, for happiness is more infectious
than small-pox. So, as I said, I sat down and waited; I looked at happy
things, zealously avoided the sight of anything unhappy, and by degrees
a little trickle of the happiness of this blissful world began to filter
into me. The trickle grew more abundant, and now, my dear fellow, if I
could for a moment divert from me into you one half of the torrent of
joy that pours through me day and night, you would throw the world, art,
everything aside, and just live, exist. When a man's body dies, it
passes into trees and flowers. Well, that is what I have been trying to
do with my soul before death."

The servant had brought into the pergola a table with syphons and
spirits, and had set a lamp upon it. As Frank spoke he leaned forward
towards the other, and Darcy for all his matter-of-fact commonsense
could have sworn that his companion's face shone, was luminous in
itself. His dark brown eyes glowed from within, the unconscious smile of
a child irradiated and transformed his face. Darcy felt suddenly
excited, exhilarated.

"Go on," he said. "Go on. I can feel you are somehow telling me sober
truth. I daresay you are mad; but I don't see that matters."

Frank laughed again.

"Mad?" he said. "Yes, certainly, if you wish. But I prefer to call it
sane. However, nothing matters less than what anybody chooses to call
things. God never labels his gifts; He just puts them into our hands;
just as he put animals in the garden of Eden, for Adam to name if he
felt disposed."

"So by the continual observance and study of things that were happy,"
continued he, "I got happiness, I got joy. But seeking it, as I did,
from Nature, I got much more which I did not seek, but stumbled upon
originally by accident. It is difficult to explain, but I will try.

"About three years ago I was sitting one morning in a place I will show
you to-morrow. It is down by the river brink, very green, dappled with
shade and sun, and the river passes there through some little clumps of
reeds. Well, as I sat there, doing nothing, but just looking and
listening, I heard the sound quite distinctly of some flute-like
instrument playing a strange unending melody. I thought at first it was
some musical yokel on the highway and did not pay much attention. But
before long the strangeness and indescribable beauty of the tune struck
me. It never repeated itself, but it never came to an end, phrase after
phrase ran its sweet course, it worked gradually and inevitably up to a
climax, and having attained it, it went on; another climax was reached
and another and another. Then with a sudden gasp of wonder I localized
where it came from. It came from the reeds and from the sky and from the
trees. It was everywhere, it was the sound of life. It was, my dear
Darcy, as the Greeks would have said, it was Pan playing on his pipes,
the voice of Nature. It was the life-melody, the world-melody."

Darcy was far too interested to interrupt, though there was a question
he would have liked to ask, and Frank went on:

"Well, for the moment I was terrified, terrified with the impotent
horror of nightmare, and I stopped my ears and just ran from the place
and got back to the house panting, trembling, literally in a panic.
Unknowingly, for at that time I only pursued joy, I had begun, since I
drew my joy from Nature, to get in touch with Nature. Nature, force,
God, call it what you will, had drawn across my face a little gossamer
web of essential life. I saw that when I emerged from my terror, and I
went very humbly back to where I had heard the Pan-pipes. But it was
nearly six months before I heard them again."

"Why was that?" asked Darcy.

"Surely because I had revolted, rebelled, and worst of all been
frightened. For I believe that just as there is nothing in the world
which so injures one's body as fear, so there is nothing that so much
shuts up the soul. I was afraid, you see, of the one thing in the world
which has real existence. No wonder its manifestation was withdrawn."

"And after six months?"

"After six months one blessed morning I heard the piping again. I wasn't
afraid that time. And since then it has grown louder, it has become more
constant. I now hear it often, and I can put myself into such an
attitude towards Nature that the pipes will almost certainly sound. And
never yet have they played the same tune, it is always something new,
something fuller, richer, more complete than before."

"What do you mean by 'such an attitude towards Nature'?" asked Darcy.

"I can't explain that; but by translating it into a bodily attitude it
is this."

Frank sat up for a moment quite straight in his chair, then slowly sunk
back with arms outspread and head drooped.

"That," he said, "an effortless attitude, but open, resting, receptive.
It is just that which you must do with your soul."

Then he sat up again.

"One word more," he said, "and I will bore you no further. Nor unless
you ask me questions shall I talk about it again. You will find me, in
fact, quite sane in my mode of life. Birds and beasts you will see
behaving somewhat intimately to me, like that moor-hen, but that is all.
I will walk with you, ride with you, play golf with you, and talk with
you on any subject you like. But I wanted you on the threshold to know
what has happened to me. And one thing more will happen."

He paused again, and a slight look of fear crossed his eyes.

"There will be a final revelation," he said, "a complete and blinding
stroke which will throw open to me, once and for all, the full
knowledge, the full realization and comprehension that I am one, just as
you are, with life. In reality there is no 'me,' no 'you,' no 'it.'
Everything is part of the one and only thing which is life. I know that
that is so, but the realization of it is not yet mine. But it will be,
and on that day, so I take it, I shall see Pan. It may mean death, the
death of my body, that is, but I don't care. It may mean immortal,
eternal life lived here and now and for ever. Then having gained that,
ah, my dear Darcy, I shall preach such a gospel of joy, showing myself
as the living proof of the truth, that Puritanism, the dismal religion
of sour faces, shall vanish like a breath of smoke, and be dispersed and
disappear in the sunlit air. But first the full knowledge must be mine."

Darcy watched his face narrowly.

"You are afraid of that moment," he said.

Frank smiled at him.

"Quite true; you are quick to have seen that. But when it comes I hope I
shall not be afraid."

For some little time there was silence; then Darcy rose.

"You have bewitched me, you extraordinary boy," he said. "You have been
telling me a fairy-story, and I find myself saying, 'Promise me it is
true.'"

"I promise you that," said the other.

"And I know I shan't sleep," added Darcy.

Frank looked at him with a sort of mild wonder as if he scarcely
understood.

"Well, what does that matter?" he said.

"I assure you it does. I am wretched unless I sleep."

"Of course I can make you sleep if I want," said Frank in a rather bored
voice.

"Well, do."

"Very good: go to bed. I'll come upstairs in ten minutes."

Frank busied himself for a little after the other had gone, moving the
table back under the awning of the veranda and quenching the lamp. Then
he went with his quick silent tread upstairs and into Darcy's room. The
latter was already in bed, but very wide-eyed and wakeful, and Frank
with an amused smile of indulgence, as for a fretful child, sat down on
the edge of the bed.

"Look at me," he said, and Darcy looked.

"The birds are sleeping in the brake," said Frank softly, "and the winds
are asleep. The sea sleeps, and the tides are but the heaving of its
breast. The stars swing slow, rocked in the great cradle of the Heavens,
and----"

He stopped suddenly, gently blew out Darcy's candle, and left him
sleeping.

Morning brought to Darcy a flood of hard commonsense, as clear and crisp
as the sunshine that filled his room. Slowly as he woke he gathered
together the broken threads of the memories of the evening which had
ended, so he told himself, in a trick of common hypnotism. That
accounted for it all; the whole strange talk he had had was under a
spell of suggestion from the extraordinary vivid boy who had once been a
man; all his own excitement, his acceptance of the incredible had been
merely the effect of a stronger, more potent will imposed on his own.
How strong that will was, he guessed from his own instantaneous
obedience to Frank's suggestion of sleep. And armed with impenetrable
commonsense he came down to breakfast. Frank had already begun, and was
consuming a large plateful of porridge and milk with the most prosaic
and healthy appetite.

"Slept well?" he asked.

"Yes, of course. Where did you learn hypnotism?"

"By the side of the river."

"You talked an amazing quantity of nonsense last night," remarked Darcy,
in a voice prickly with reason.

"Rather. I felt quite giddy. Look, I remembered to order a dreadful
daily paper for you. You can read about money markets or politics or
cricket matches."

Darcy looked at him closely. In the morning light Frank looked even
fresher, younger, more vital than he had done the night before, and the
sight of him somehow dinted Darcy's armor of commonsense.

"You are the most extraordinary fellow I ever saw," he said. "I want to
ask you some more questions."

"Ask away," said Frank.

       *       *       *       *       *

For the next day or two Darcy plied his friend with many questions,
objections and criticisms on the theory of life and gradually got out of
him a coherent and complete account of his experience. In brief then,
Frank believed that "by lying naked," as he put it, to the force which
controls the passage of the stars, the breaking of a wave, the budding
of a tree, the love of a youth and maiden, he had succeeded in a way
hitherto undreamed of in possessing himself of the essential principle
of life. Day by day, so he thought, he was getting nearer to, and in
closer union with the great power itself which caused all life to be,
the spirit of nature, of force, or the spirit of God. For himself, he
confessed to what others would call paganism; it was sufficient for him
that there existed a principle of life. He did not worship it, he did
not pray to it, he did not praise it. Some of it existed in all human
beings, just as it existed in trees and animals; to realize and make
living to himself the fact that it was all one, was his sole aim and
object.

Here perhaps Darcy would put in a word of warning. "Take care," he said.
"To see Pan meant death, did it not?"

Frank's eyebrows would rise at this.

"What does that matter?" he said. "True, the Greeks were always right,
and they said so, but there is another possibility. For the nearer I get
to it, the more living, the more vital and young I become."

"What then do you expect the final revelation will do for you?"

"I have told you," said he. "It will make me immortal."

But it was not so much from speech and argument that Darcy grew to grasp
his friend's conception, as from the ordinary conduct of his life. They
were passing, for instance, one morning down the village street, when an
old woman, very bent and decrepit, but with an extraordinary
cheerfulness of face, hobbled out from her cottage. Frank instantly
stopped when he saw her.

"You old darling! How goes it all?" he said.

But she did not answer, her dim old eyes were riveted on his face; she
seemed to drink in like a thirsty creature the beautiful radiance which
shone there. Suddenly she put her two withered old hands on his
shoulders.

"You're just the sunshine itself," she said, and he kissed her and
passed on.

But scarcely a hundred yards further a strange contradiction of such
tenderness occurred. A child running along the path towards them fell on
its face, and set up a dismal cry of fright and pain. A look of horror
came into Frank's eyes, and, putting his fingers in his ears, he fled at
full speed down the street, and did not pause till he was out of
hearing. Darcy, having ascertained that the child was not really hurt,
followed him in bewilderment.

"Are you without pity then?" he asked.

Frank shook his head impatiently.

"Can't you see?" he asked. "Can't you understand that that sort of
thing, pain, anger, anything unlovely throws me back, retards the
coming of the great hour! Perhaps when it comes I shall be able to piece
that side of life on to the other, on to the true religion of joy. At
present I can't."

"But the old woman. Was she not ugly?"

Frank's radiance gradually returned.

"Ah, no. She was like me. She longed for joy, and knew it when she saw
it, the old darling."

Another question suggested itself.

"Then what about Christianity?" asked Darcy.

"I can't accept it. I can't believe in any creed of which the central
doctrine is that God who is Joy should have had to suffer. Perhaps it
was so; in some inscrutable way I believe it may have been so, but I
don't understand how it was possible. So I leave it alone; my affair is
joy."

They had come to the weir above the village, and the thunder of riotous
cool water was heavy in the air. Trees dipped into the translucent
stream with slender trailing branches, and the meadow where they stood
was starred with midsummer blossomings. Larks shot up caroling into the
crystal dome of blue, and a thousand voices of June sang round them.
Frank, bare-headed as was his wont, with his coat slung over his arm and
his shirt sleeves rolled up above the elbow, stood there like some
beautiful wild animal with eyes half-shut and mouth half-open, drinking
in the scented warmth of the air. Then suddenly he flung himself face
downwards on the grass at the edge of the stream, burying his face in
the daisies and cowslips, and lay stretched there in wide-armed ecstasy,
with his long fingers pressing and stroking the dewy herbs of the field.
Never before had Darcy seen him thus fully possessed by his idea; his
caressing fingers, his half-buried face pressed close to the grass, even
the clothed lines of his figure were instinct with a vitality that
somehow was different from that of other men. And some faint glow from
it reached Darcy, some thrill, some vibration from that charged
recumbent body passed to him, and for a moment he understood as he had
not understood before, despite his persistent questions and the candid
answers they received, how real, and how realized by Frank, his idea
was.

Then suddenly the muscles in Frank's neck became stiff and alert, and
he half-raised his head, whispering, "The Pan-pipes, the Pan-pipes.
Close, oh, so close."

Very slowly, as if a sudden movement might interrupt the melody, he
raised himself and leaned on the elbow of his bent arm. His eyes opened
wider, the lower lids drooped as if he focused his eyes on something
very far away, and the smile on his face broadened and quivered like
sunlight on still water, till the exultance of its happiness was
scarcely human. So he remained motionless and rapt for some minutes,
then the look of listening died from his face, and he bowed his head
satisfied.

"Ah, that was good," he said. "How is it possible you did not hear? Oh,
you poor fellow! Did you really hear nothing?"

A week of this outdoor and stimulating life did wonders in restoring to
Darcy the vigor and health which his weeks of fever had filched from
him, and as his normal activity and higher pressure of vitality
returned, he seemed to himself to fall even more under the spell which
the miracle of Frank's youth cast over him. Twenty times a day he found
himself saying to himself suddenly at the end of some ten minutes'
silent resistance to the absurdity of Frank's idea: "But it isn't
possible; it can't be possible," and from the fact of his having to
assure himself so frequently of this, he knew that he was struggling and
arguing with a conclusion which already had taken root in his mind. For
in any case a visible living miracle confronted him, since it was
equally impossible that this youth, this boy, trembling on the verge of
manhood, was thirty-five. Yet such was the fact.

July was ushered in by a couple of days of blustering and fretful rain,
and Darcy, unwilling to risk a chill, kept to the house. But to Frank
this weeping change of weather seemed to have no bearing on the behavior
of man, and he spent his days exactly as he did under the suns of June,
lying in his hammock, stretched on the dripping grass, or making huge
rambling excursions into the forest, the birds hopping from tree to tree
after him, to return in the evening, drenched and soaked, but with the
same unquenchable flame of joy burning within him.

"Catch cold?" he would ask, "I've forgotten how to do it, I think.
I suppose it makes one's body more sensible always to sleep out-of-doors.
People who live indoors always remind me of something peeled and
skinless."

"Do you mean to say you slept out-of-doors last night in that deluge?"
asked Darcy. "And where, may I ask?"

Frank thought a moment.

"I slept in the hammock till nearly dawn," he said. "For I remember the
light blinked in the east when I awoke. Then I went--where did I go?--oh,
yes, to the meadow where the Pan-pipes sounded so close a week ago. You
were with me, do you remember? But I always have a rug if it is wet."

And he went whistling upstairs.

Somehow that little touch, his obvious effort to recall where he had
slept, brought strangely home to Darcy the wonderful romance of which he
was the still half-incredulous beholder. Sleep till close on dawn in a
hammock, then the tramp--or probably scamper--underneath the windy and
weeping heavens to the remote and lonely meadow by the weir! The picture
of other such nights rose before him; Frank sleeping perhaps by the
bathing-place under the filtered twilight of the stars, or the white
blaze of moon-shine, a stir and awakening at some dead hour, perhaps a
space of silent wide-eyed thought, and then a wandering through the
hushed woods to some other dormitory, alone with his happiness, alone
with the joy and the life that suffused and enveloped him, without other
thought or desire or aim except the hourly and never-ceasing communion
with the joy of nature.

They were in the middle of dinner that night, talking on indifferent
subjects, when Darcy suddenly broke off in the middle of a sentence.

"I've got it," he said. "At last I've got it."

"Congratulate you," said Frank. "But what?"

"The radical unsoundness of your idea. It is this: All nature from
highest to lowest is full, crammed full of suffering; every living
organism in nature preys on another, yet in your aim to get close to, to
be one with nature, you leave suffering altogether out; you run away
from it, you refuse to recognize it. And you are waiting, you say, for
the final revelation."

Frank's brow clouded slightly.

"Well?" he asked, rather wearily.

"Cannot you guess then when the final revelation will be? In joy you are
supreme, I grant you that; I did not know a man could be so master of
it. You have learned perhaps practically all that nature can teach. And
if, as you think, the final revelation is coming to you, it will be the
revelation of horror, suffering, death, pain in all its hideous forms.
Suffering does exist: you hate it and fear it."

Frank held up his hand.

"Stop; let me think," he said.

There was silence for a long minute.

"That never struck me," he said at length. "It is possible that what you
suggest is true. Does the sight of Pan mean that, do you think? Is it
that nature, take it altogether, suffers horribly, suffers to a hideous
inconceivable extent? Shall I be shown all the suffering?"

He got up and came round to where Darcy sat.

"If it is so, so be it," he said. "Because, my dear fellow, I am near,
so splendidly near to the final revelation. To-day the pipes have
sounded almost without pause. I have even heard the rustle in the
bushes, I believe, of Pan's coming. I have seen, yes, I saw to-day, the
bushes pushed aside as if by a hand, and piece of a face, not human,
peered through. But I was not frightened, at least I did not run away
this time."

He took a turn up to the window and back again.

"Yes, there is suffering all through," he said, "and I have left it all
out of my search. Perhaps, as you say, the revelation will be that. And
in that case, it will be good-bye. I have gone on one line. I shall have
gone too far along one road, without having explored the other. But I
can't go back now. I wouldn't if I could; not a step would I retrace! In
any case, whatever the revelation is, it will be God. I'm sure of that."

The rainy weather soon passed, and with the return of the sun Darcy
again joined Frank in long rambling days. It grew extraordinarily
hotter, and with the fresh bursting of life, after the rain, Frank's
vitality seemed to blaze higher and higher. Then, as is the habit of the
English weather, one evening clouds began to bank themselves up in the
west, the sun went down in a glare of coppery thunder-rack, and the
whole earth broiling under an unspeakable oppression and sultriness
paused and panted for the storm. After sunset the remote fires of
lightning began to wink and flicker on the horizon, but when bed-time
came the storm seemed to have moved no nearer, though a very low
unceasing noise of thunder was audible. Weary and oppressed by the
stress of the day, Darcy fell at once into a heavy uncomforting sleep.

He woke suddenly into full consciousness, with the din of some appalling
explosion of thunder in his ears, and sat up in bed with racing heart.
Then for a moment, as he recovered himself from the panic-land which
lies between sleeping and waking, there was silence, except for the
steady hissing of rain on the shrubs outside his window. But suddenly
that silence was shattered and shredded into fragments by a scream from
somewhere close at hand outside in the black garden, a scream of supreme
and despairing terror. Again, and once again it shrilled up, and then a
babble of awful words was interjected. A quivering sobbing voice that he
knew, said:

"My God, oh, my God; oh, Christ!"

And then followed a little mocking, bleating laugh. Then was silence
again; only the rain hissed on the shrubs.

All this was but the affair of a moment, and without pause either to put
on clothes or light a candle, Darcy was already fumbling at his
door-handle. Even as he opened it he met a terror-stricken face outside,
that of the man-servant who carried a light.

"Did you hear?" he asked.

The man's face was bleached to a dull shining whiteness.

"Yes, sir," he said. "It was the master's voice."

       *       *       *       *       *

Together they hurried down the stairs, and through the dining-room where
an orderly table for breakfast had already been laid, and out on to the
terrace. The rain for the moment had been utterly stayed, as if the tap
of the heavens had been turned off, and under the lowering black sky,
not quite dark, since the moon rode somewhere serene behind the
conglomerated thunder-clouds, Darcy stumbled into the garden, followed
by the servant with the candle. The monstrous leaping shadow of himself
was cast before him on the lawn; lost and wandering odors of rose and
lily and damp earth were thick about him, but more pungent was some
sharp and acrid smell that suddenly reminded him of a certain chÃ¢let in
which he had once taken refuge in the Alps. In the blackness of the hazy
light from the sky, and the vague tossing of the candle behind him, he
saw that the hammock in which Frank so often lay was tenanted. A gleam
of white shirt was there, as if a man sitting up in it, but across that
there was an obscure dark shadow, and as he approached the acrid odor
grew more intense.

He was now only some few yards away, when suddenly the black shadow
seemed to jump into the air, then came down with tappings of hard hoofs
on the brick path that ran down the pergola, and with frolicsome
skippings galloped off into the bushes. When that was gone Darcy could
see quite clearly that a shirted figure sat up in the hammock. For one
moment, from sheer terror of the unseen, he hung on his step, and the
servant joining him they walked together to the hammock.

It was Frank. He was in shirt and trousers only, and he sat up with
braced arms. For one half-second he stared at them, his face a mask of
horrible contorted terror. His upper lip was drawn back so that the gums
of the teeth appeared, and his eyes were focused not on the two who
approached him but on something quite close to him; his nostrils were
widely expanded, as if he panted for breath, and terror incarnate and
repulsion and deathly anguish ruled dreadful lines on his smooth cheeks
and forehead. Then even as they looked the body sank backwards, and the
ropes of the hammock wheezed and strained.

Darcy lifted him out and carried him indoors. Once he thought there was
a faint convulsive stir of the limbs that lay with so dead a weight in
his arms, but when they got inside, there was no trace of life. But the
look of supreme terror and agony of fear had gone from his face, a boy
tired with play but still smiling in his sleep was the burden he laid on
the floor. His eyes had closed, and the beautiful mouth lay in smiling
curves, even as when a few mornings ago, in the meadow by the weir, it
had quivered to the music of the unheard melody of Pan's pipes. Then
they looked further.

Frank had come back from his bath before dinner that night in his usual
costume of shirt and trousers only. He had not dressed, and during
dinner, so Darcy remembered, he had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt
to above the elbow. Later, as they sat and talked after dinner on the
close sultriness of the evening, he had unbuttoned the front of his
shirt to let what little breath of wind there was play on his skin. The
sleeves were rolled up now, the front of the shirt was unbuttoned, and
on his arms and on the brown skin of his chest were strange
discolorations which grew momently more clear and defined, till they saw
that the marks were pointed prints, as if caused by the hoofs of some
monstrous goat that had leaped and stamped upon him.




THE WOMAN'S GHOST STORY[I]

BY ALGERNON BLACKWOOD

"Yes," she said, from her seat in the dark corner, "I'll tell you an
experience if you care to listen. And, what's more, I'll tell it
briefly, without trimmings--I mean without unessentials. That's a thing
story-tellers never do, you know," she laughed. "They drag in all the
unessentials and leave their listeners to disentangle; but I'll give you
just the essentials, and you can make of it what you please. But on one
condition: that at the end you ask no questions, because I can't explain
it and have no wish to."

We agreed. We were all serious. After listening to a dozen prolix
stories from people who merely wished to "talk" but had nothing to tell,
we wanted "essentials."

"In those days," she began, feeling from the quality of our silence that
we were with her, "in those days I was interested in psychic things, and
had arranged to sit up alone in a haunted house in the middle of London.
It was a cheap and dingy lodging-house in a mean street, unfurnished.
I had already made a preliminary examination in daylight that afternoon,
and the keys from the caretaker, who lived next door, were in my pocket.
The story was a good one--satisfied me, at any rate, that it was worth
investigating; and I won't weary you with details as to the woman's
murder and all the tiresome elaboration as to _why_ the place was
_alive_. Enough that it was.

"I was a good deal bored, therefore, to see a man, whom I took to be the
talkative old caretaker, waiting for me on the steps when I went in at
11 P.M., for I had sufficiently explained that I wished to be there
alone for the night.

"'I wished to show you _the_ room,' he mumbled, and of course I couldn't
exactly refuse, having tipped him for the temporary loan of a chair and
table.

"'Come in, then, and let's be quick,' I said.

"We went in, he shuffling after me through the unlighted hall up to the
first floor where the murder had taken place, and I prepared myself to
hear his inevitable account before turning him out with the half-crown
his persistence had earned. After lighting the gas I sat down in the
arm-chair he had provided--a faded, brown plush arm-chair--and turned
for the first time to face him and get through with the performance as
quickly as possible. And it was in that instant I got my first shock.
The man was _not_ the caretaker. It was not the old fool, Carey, I had
interviewed earlier in the day and made my plans with. My heart gave a
horrid jump.

"'Now who are _you_, pray?' I said. 'You're not Carey, the man I
arranged with this afternoon. Who are you?'

"I felt uncomfortable, as you may imagine. I was a 'psychical
researcher,' and a young woman of new tendencies, and proud of my
liberty, but I did not care to find myself in an empty house with a
stranger. Something of my confidence left me. Confidence with women, you
know, is all humbug after a certain point. Or perhaps you don't know,
for most of you are men. But anyhow my pluck ebbed in a quick rush, and
I felt afraid.

"'Who are you?' I repeated quickly and nervously. The fellow was well
dressed, youngish and good-looking, but with a face of great sadness.
I myself was barely thirty. I am giving you essentials, or I would not
mention it. Out of quite ordinary things comes this story. I think
that's why it has value.

"'No,' he said; 'I'm the man who was frightened to death.'

"His voice and his words ran through me like a knife, and I felt ready
to drop. In my pocket was the book I had bought to make notes in. I felt
the pencil sticking in the socket. I felt, too, the extra warm things
I had put on to sit up in, as no bed or sofa was available--a hundred
things dashed through my mind, foolishly and without sequence or
meaning, as the way is when one is really frightened. Unessentials
leaped up and puzzled me, and I thought of what the papers might say if
it came out, and what my 'smart' brother-in-law would think, and whether
it would be told that I had cigarettes in my pocket, and was a
free-thinker.

"'The man who was frightened to death!' I repeated aghast.

"'That's me,' he said stupidly.

"I stared at him just as you would have done--any one of you men now
listening to me--and felt my life ebbing and flowing like a sort of hot
fluid. You needn't laugh! That's how I felt. Small things, you know,
touch the mind with great earnestness when terror is there--_real
terror_. But I might have been at a middle-class tea-party, for all the
ideas I had: they were so ordinary!

"'But I thought you were the caretaker I tipped this afternoon to let me
sleep here!' I gasped. 'Did--did Carey send you to meet me?'

"'No,' he replied in a voice that touched my boots somehow. 'I am the
man who was frightened to death. And what is more, I am frightened
_now_!'

"'So am I!' I managed to utter, speaking instinctively. 'I'm simply
terrified.'

"'Yes,' he replied in that same odd voice that seemed to sound within
me. 'But you are still in the flesh, and I--_am not_!'

"I felt the need for vigorous self-assertion. I stood up in that empty,
unfurnished room, digging the nails into my palms and clenching my
teeth. I was determined to assert my individuality and my courage as a
new woman and a free soul.

"'You mean to say you are not in the flesh!' I gasped. 'What in the
world are you talking about?'

"The silence of the night swallowed up my voice. For the first time I
realized that darkness was over the city; that dust lay upon the stairs;
that the floor above was untenanted and the floor below empty. I was
alone in an unoccupied and haunted house, unprotected, and a woman.
I chilled. I heard the wind round the house, and knew the stars were
hidden. My thoughts rushed to policemen and omnibuses, and everything
that was useful and comforting. I suddenly realized what a fool I was to
come to such a house alone. I was icily afraid. I thought the end of my
life had come. I was an utter fool to go in for psychical research when
I had not the necessary nerve.

"'Good God!' I gasped. 'If you're not Carey, the man I arranged with,
who are you?'

"I was really stiff with terror. The man moved slowly towards me across
the empty room. I held out my arm to stop him, getting up out of my
chair at the same moment, and he came to halt just opposite to me, a
smile on his worn, sad face.

"'I told you who I am,' he repeated quietly with a sigh, looking at me
with the saddest eyes I have ever seen, 'and I am frightened _still_.'

"By this time I was convinced that I was entertaining either a rogue or
a madman, and I cursed my stupidity in bringing the man in without
having seen his face. My mind was quickly made up, and I knew what to
do. Ghosts and psychic phenomena flew to the winds. If I angered the
creature my life might pay the price. I must humor him till I got to the
door, and then race for the street. I stood bolt upright and faced him.
We were about of a height, and I was a strong, athletic woman who played
hockey in winter and climbed Alps in summer. My hand itched for a stick,
but I had none.

"'Now, of course, I remember,' I said with a sort of stiff smile that
was very hard to force. 'Now I remember your case and the wonderful way
you behaved . . . .'

"The man stared at me stupidly, turning his head to watch me as I backed
more and more quickly to the door. But when his face broke into a smile
I could control myself no longer. I reached the door in a run, and shot
out on to the landing. Like a fool, I turned the wrong way, and stumbled
over the stairs leading to the next story. But it was too late to
change. The man was after me, I was sure, though no sound of footsteps
came; and I dashed up the next flight, tearing my skirt and banging my
ribs in the darkness, and rushed headlong into the first room I came
to. Luckily the door stood ajar, and, still more fortunate, there was a
key in the lock. In a second I had slammed the door, flung my whole
weight against it, and turned the key.

"I was safe, but my heart was beating like a drum. A second later it
seemed to stop altogether, for I saw that there was some one else in the
room besides myself. A man's figure stood between me and the windows,
where the street lamps gave just enough light to outline his shape
against the glass. I'm a plucky woman, you know, for even then I didn't
give up hope, but I may tell you that I have never felt so vilely
frightened in all my born days. I had locked myself in with him!

"The man leaned against the window, watching me where I lay in a
collapsed heap upon the floor. So there were two men in the house with
me, I reflected. Perhaps other rooms were occupied too! What could it
all mean? But, as I stared something changed in the room, or in me--hard
to say which--and I realized my mistake, so that my fear, which had so
far been physical, at once altered its character and became _psychical_.
I became afraid in my soul instead of in my heart, and I knew
immediately who this man was.

"'How in the world did you get up here?' I stammered to him across the
empty room, amazement momentarily stemming my fear.

"'Now, let me tell you,' he began, in that odd faraway voice of his that
went down my spine like a knife. 'I'm in different space, for one thing,
and you'd find me in any room you went into; for according to your way
of measuring, I'm _all over the house_. Space is a bodily condition, but
I am out of the body, and am not affected by space. It's my condition
that keeps me here. I want something to change my condition for me, for
then I could get away. What I want is sympathy. Or, really, more than
sympathy; I want affection--I want _love_!'

"While he was speaking I gathered myself slowly upon my feet. I wanted
to scream and cry and laugh all at once, but I only succeeded in
sighing, for my emotion was exhausted and a numbness was coming over me.
I felt for the matches in my pocket and made a movement towards the gas
jet.

"'I should be much happier if you didn't light the gas,' he said at
once, 'for the vibrations of your light hurt me a good deal. You need
not be afraid that I shall injure you. I can't touch your body to begin
with, for there's a great gulf fixed, you know; and really this
half-light suits me best. Now, let me continue what I was trying to say
before. You know, so many people have come to this house to see me, and
most of them have seen me, and one and all have been terrified. If only,
oh, if only some one would be _not_ terrified, but kind and loving to
me! Then, you see, I might be able to change my condition and get away.'

"His voice was so sad that I felt tears start somewhere at the back of
my eyes; but fear kept all else in check, and I stood shaking and cold
as I listened to him.

"'Who are you then? Of course Carey didn't send you, I know now,' I
managed to utter. My thoughts scattered dreadfully and I could think of
nothing to say. I was afraid of a stroke.

"'I know nothing about Carey, or who he is,' continued the man quietly,
'and the name my body had I have forgotten, thank God; but I am the man
who was frightened to death in this house ten years ago, and I have been
frightened ever since, and am frightened still; for the succession of
cruel and curious people who come to this house to see the ghost, and
thus keep alive its atmosphere of terror, only helps to render my
condition worse. If only some one would be kind to me--_laugh_, speak
gently and rationally with me, cry if they like, pity, comfort, soothe
me--anything but come here in curiosity and tremble as you are now doing
in that corner. Now, madam, won't you take pity on me?' His voice rose
to a dreadful cry. 'Won't you step out into the middle of the room and
try to love me a little?'

"A horrible laughter came gurgling up in my throat as I heard him, but
the sense of pity was stronger than the laughter, and I found myself
actually leaving the support of the wall and approaching the center of
the floor.

"'By God!' he cried, at once straightening up against the window, 'you
have done a kind act. That's the first attempt at sympathy that has
been shown me since I died, and I feel better already. In life, you
know, I was a misanthrope. Everything went wrong with me, and I came to
hate my fellow men so much that I couldn't bear to see them even. Of
course, like begets like, and this hate was returned. Finally I suffered
from horrible delusions, and my room became haunted with demons that
laughed and grimaced, and one night I ran into a whole cluster of them
near the bed--and the fright stopped my heart and killed me. It's hate
and remorse, as much as terror, that clogs me so thickly and keeps me
here. If only some one could feel pity, and sympathy, and perhaps a
little love for me, I could get away and be happy. When you came this
afternoon to see over the house I watched you, and a little hope came to
me for the first time. I saw you had courage, originality,
resource--_love_. If only I could touch your heart, without frightening
you, I knew I could perhaps tap that love you have stored up in your
being there, and thus borrow the wings for my escape!'

"Now I must confess my heart began to ache a little, as fear left me and
the man's words sank their sad meaning into me. Still, the whole affair
was so incredible, and so touched with unholy quality, and the story of
a woman's murder I had come to investigate had so obviously nothing to
do with this thing, that I felt myself in a kind of wild dream that
seemed likely to stop at any moment and leave me somewhere in bed after
a nightmare.

"Moreover, his words possessed me to such an extent that I found it
impossible to reflect upon anything else at all, or to consider
adequately any ways or means of action or escape.

"I moved a little nearer to him in the gloom, horribly frightened, of
course, but with the beginnings of a strange determination in my heart.

"'You women,' he continued, his voice plainly thrilling at my approach,
'you wonderful women, to whom life often brings no opportunity of
spending your great love, oh, if you only could know how many of _us_
simply yearn for it! It would save our souls, if but you knew. Few might
find the chance that you now have, but if you only spent your love
freely, without definite object, just letting it flow openly for all who
need, you would reach hundreds and thousands of souls like me, and
_release us_! Oh, madam, I ask you again to feel with me, to be kind and
gentle--and if you can to love me a little!'

"My heart did leap within me and this time the tears did come, for I
could not restrain them. I laughed too, for the way he called me 'madam'
sounded so odd, here in this empty room at midnight in a London street,
but my laughter stopped dead and merged in a flood of weeping when I saw
how my change of feeling affected him. He had left his place by the
window and was kneeling on the floor at my feet, his hands stretched out
towards me, and the first signs of a kind of glory about his head.

"'Put your arms round me and kiss me, for the love of God!' he cried.
'Kiss me, oh, kiss me, and I shall be freed! You have done so much
already--now do this!'

"I stuck there, hesitating, shaking, my determination on the verge of
action, yet not quite able to compass it. But the terror had almost
gone.

"'Forget that I'm a man and you're a woman,' he continued in the most
beseeching voice I ever heard. 'Forget that I'm a ghost, and come out
boldly and press me to you with a great kiss, and let your love flow
into me. Forget yourself just for one minute and do a brave thing! Oh,
love me, _love me_, LOVE ME! and I shall be free!'

"The words, or the deep force they somehow released in the center of my
being, stirred me profoundly, and an emotion infinitely greater than
fear surged up over me and carried me with it across the edge of action.
Without hesitation I took two steps forward towards him where he knelt,
and held out my arms. Pity and love were in my heart at that moment,
genuine pity, I swear, and genuine love. I forgot myself and my little
tremblings in a great desire to help another soul.

"'I love you! poor, aching, unhappy thing! I love you,' I cried through
hot tears; 'and I am not the least bit afraid in the world.'

"The man uttered a curious sound, like laughter, yet not laughter, and
turned his face up to me. The light from the street below fell on it,
but there was another light, too, shining all round it that seemed to
come from the eyes and skin. He rose to his feet and met me, and in that
second I folded him to my breast and kissed him full on the lips again
and again."

All our pipes had gone out, and not even a skirt rustled in that dark
studio as the story-teller paused a moment to steady her voice, and put
a hand softly up to her eyes before going on again.

"Now, what can I say, and how can I describe to you, all you skeptical
men sitting there with pipes in your mouths, the amazing sensation I
experienced of holding an intangible, impalpable thing so closely to my
heart that it touched my body with equal pressure all the way down, and
then melted away somewhere into my very being? For it was like seizing a
rush of cool wind and feeling a touch of burning fire the moment it had
struck its swift blow and passed on. A series of shocks ran all over and
all through me; a momentary ecstasy of flaming sweetness and wonder
thrilled down into me; my heart gave another great leap--and then I was
alone.

"The room was empty. I turned on the gas and struck a match to prove it.
All fear had left me, and something was singing round me in the air and
in my heart like the joy of a spring morning in youth. Not all the
devils or shadows or hauntings in the world could then have caused me a
single tremor.

"I unlocked the door and went all over the dark house, even into kitchen
and cellar and up among the ghostly attics. But the house was empty.
Something had left it. I lingered a short hour, analyzing, thinking,
wondering--you can guess what and how, perhaps, but I won't detail, for
I promised only essentials, remember--and then went out to sleep the
remainder of the night in my own flat, locking the door behind me upon a
house no longer haunted.

"But my uncle, Sir Henry, the owner of the house, required an account of
my adventure, and of course I was in duty bound to give him some kind of
a true story. Before I could begin, however, he held up his hand to stop
me.

"'First,' he said, 'I wish to tell you a little deception I ventured to
practice on you. So many people have been to that house and seen the
ghost that I came to think the story acted on their imaginations, and
I wished to make a better test. So I invented for their benefit another
story, with the idea that if you did see anything I could be sure it was
not due merely to an excited imagination.'

"'Then what you told me about a woman having been murdered, and all
that, was not the true story of the haunting?'

"'It was not. The true story is that a cousin of mine went mad in that
house, and killed himself in a fit of morbid terror following upon years
of miserable hypochondriasis. It is his figure that investigators see.'

"'That explains, then,' I gasped----

"'Explains what?'

"I thought of that poor struggling soul, longing all these years for
escape, and determined to keep my story for the present to myself.

"'Explains, I mean, why I did not see the ghost of the murdered woman,'
I concluded.

"'Precisely,' said Sir Henry, 'and why, if you had seen anything, it
would have had value, inasmuch as it could not have been caused by the
imagination working upon a story you already knew.'"

THE PHANTOM 'RICKSHAW

BY RUDYARD KIPLING

          "May no ill dreams disturb my rest,
           Nor Powers of Darkness me molest."
                        --_Evening Hymn._


One of the few advantages that India has over England is a certain great
Knowability. After five years' service a man is directly or indirectly
acquainted with the two or three hundred Civilians in his Province, all
the Messes of ten or twelve Regiments and Batteries, and some fifteen
hundred other people of the non-official castes. In ten years his
knowledge should be doubled, and at the end of twenty he knows, or knows
something about, almost every Englishman in the Empire, and may travel
anywhere and everywhere without paying hotel-bills.

Globe-trotters who expect entertainment as a right, have, even within my
memory, blunted this open-heartedness, but, none the less, to-day if you
belong to the Inner Circle and are neither a bear nor a black sheep all
houses are open to you and our small world is very kind and helpful.

Rickett of Kamartha stayed with Polder of Kumaon, some fifteen years
ago. He meant to stay two nights only, but was knocked down by rheumatic
fever, and for six weeks disorganized Polder's establishment, stopped
Polder's work, and nearly died in Polder's bed-room. Polder behaves as
though he had been placed under eternal obligation by Rickett, and
yearly sends the little Ricketts a box of presents and toys. It is the
same everywhere. The men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you
their opinion that you are an incompetent ass, and the women who blacken
your character and misunderstand your wife's amusements, will work
themselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious
trouble.

Heatherlegh, the Doctor, kept, in addition to his regular practice, a
hospital on his private account--an arrangement of loose-boxes for
Incurables, his friends called it--but it was really a sort of
fitting-up shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather.
The weather in India is often sultry, and since the tale of bricks is a
fixed quantity, and the only liberty allowed is permission to work
overtime and get no thanks, men occasionally break down and become as
mixed as the metaphors in this sentence.

Heatherlegh is the nicest doctor that ever was, and his invariable
prescription to all his patients is "lie low, go slow, and keep cool."
He says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this
world justifies. He maintains that overwork slew Pansay who died under
his hands about three years ago. He has, of course, the right to speak
authoritatively, and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack in
Pansay's head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and
pressed him to death. "Pansay went off the handle," says Heatherlegh,
"after the stimulus of long leave at Home. He may or he may not have
behaved like a blackguard to Mrs. Keith-Wessington. My notion is that
the work of the Katabundi Settlement ran him off his legs, and that he
took to brooding and making much of an ordinary P. & O. flirtation. He
certainly was engaged to Miss Mannering, and she certainly broke off the
engagement. Then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about
ghosts developed itself. Overwork started his illness, kept it alight,
and killed him, poor devil. Write him off to the System--one man to do
the work of two-and-a-half men."

I do not believe this. I used to sit up with Pansay sometimes when
Heatherlegh was called out to visit patients and I happened to be within
claim. The man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low, even
voice the procession of men, women, children, and devils that was always
passing at the bottom of his bed. He had a sick man's command of
language. When he recovered I suggested that he should write out the
whole affair from beginning to end, knowing that ink might assist him to
ease his mind. When little boys have learned a new bad word they are
never happy till they have chalked it up on a door. And this also is
Literature.

He was in a high fever while he was writing, and the blood-and-thunder
Magazine style he adopted did not calm him. Two months afterwards he was
reported fit for duty, but, in spite of the fact that he was urgently
needed to help an undermanned Commission stagger through a deficit, he
preferred to die; vowing at the last that he was hag-ridden. I secured
his manuscript before he died, and this is his version of the affair,
dated 1885:--

       *       *       *       *       *

My doctor tells me that I need rest and change of air. It is not
improbable that I shall get both ere long--rest that neither the
red-coated orderly nor the mid-day gun can break, and change of air far
beyond that which any homeward-bound steamer can give me. In the
meantime I am resolved to stay where I am; and, in flat defiance of my
doctor's orders, to take all the world into my confidence. You shall
learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady; and shall, too,
judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth
was ever so tormented as I.

Speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the drop-bolts are
drawn, my story, wild and hideously improbable as it may appear, demands
at least attention. That it will ever receive credence I utterly
disbelieve. Two months ago I should have scouted as mad or drunk the man
who had dared tell me the like. Two months ago I was the happiest man in
India. To-day, from Peshawar to the sea, there is no one more wretched.
My doctor and I are the only two who know this. His explanation is that
my brain, digestion and eyesight are all slightly affected; giving rise
to my frequent and persistent "delusions." Delusions, indeed! I call him
a fool; but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile, the same
bland professional manner, the same neatly-trimmed red whiskers, till I
begin to suspect that I am an ungrateful, evil-tempered invalid. But you
shall judge for yourselves.

Three years ago it was my fortune--my great misfortune--to sail from
Gravesend to Bombay, on return from long leave, with one Agnes
Keith-Wessington, wife of an officer on the Bombay side. It does not in
the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was. Be content
with the knowledge that, ere the voyage had ended, both she and I were
desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another. Heaven knows
that I can make the admission now without one particle of vanity. In
matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who
accepts. From the first day of our ill-omened attachment, I was
conscious that Agnes's passion was a stronger, a more dominant, and--if
I may use the expression--a purer sentiment than mine. Whether she
recognized the fact then, I do not know. Afterwards it was bitterly
plain to both of us.

Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went our respective
ways, to meet no more for the next three or four months, when my leave
and her love took us both to Simla. There we spent the season together;
and there my fire of straw burnt itself out to a pitiful end with the
closing year. I attempt no excuse. I make no apology. Mrs. Wessington
had given up much for my sake, and was prepared to give up all. From my
own lips, in August, 1882, she learnt that I was sick of her presence,
tired of her company, and weary of the sound of her voice. Ninety-nine
women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as I wearied of them;
seventy-five of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by
active and obtrusive flirtation with other men. Mrs. Wessington was the
hundredth. On her neither my openly-expressed aversion, nor the cutting
brutalities with which I garnished our interviews had the least effect.

"Jack, darling!" was her one eternal cuckoo-cry, "I'm sure it's all a
mistake--a hideous mistake; and we'll be good friends again some day.
_Please_ forgive me, Jack, dear."

I was the offender, and I knew it. That knowledge transformed my pity
into passive endurance, and, eventually, into blind hate--the same
instinct, I suppose, which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider
he has but half killed. And with this hate in my bosom the season of
1882 came to an end.

Next year we met again at Simla--she with her monotonous face and timid
attempts at reconciliation, and I with loathing of her in every fiber of
my frame. Several times I could not avoid meeting her alone; and on each
occasion her words were identically the same. Still the unreasoning wail
that it was all a "mistake"; and still the hope of eventually "making
friends." I might have seen, had I cared to look, that that hope only
was keeping her alive. She grew more wan and thin month by month. You
will agree with me, at least, that such conduct would have driven any
one to despair. It was uncalled for, childish, unwomanly. I maintain
that she was much to blame. And again, sometimes, in the black,
fever-stricken night watches, I have begun to think that I might have
been a little kinder to her. But that really _is_ a "delusion." I could
not have continued pretending to love her when I didn't; could I? It
would have been unfair to us both.

Last year we met again--on the same terms as before. The same weary
appeals, and the same curt answers from my lips. At least I would make
her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the
old relationship. As the season wore on, we fell apart--that is to say,
she found it difficult to meet me, for I had other and more absorbing
interests to attend to. When I think it over quietly in my sick-room,
the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade
were fantastically intermingled--my courtship of little Kitty Mannering;
my hopes, doubts and fears; our long rides together; my trembling avowal
of attachment; her reply; and now and again a vision of a white face
flitting by in the 'rickshaw with the black and white liveries I once
watched for so earnestly; the wave of Mrs. Wessington's gloved hand;
and, when she met me alone, which was but seldom, the irksome monotony
of her appeal. I loved Kitty Mannering, honestly, heartily loved her,
and with my love for her grew my hatred for Agnes. In August Kitty and I
were engaged. The next day I met those accursed "magpie" _jhampanies_ at
the back of Jakko, and, moved by some passing sentiment of pity, stopped
to tell Mrs. Wessington everything. She knew it already.

"So I hear you're engaged, Jack dear." Then, without a moment's pause:
"I'm sure it's all a mistake--a hideous mistake. We shall be as good
friends some day, Jack, as we ever were."

My answer might have made even a man wince. It cut the dying woman
before me like the blow of a whip. "Please forgive me, Jack; I didn't
mean to make you angry; but it's true, it's true!"

And Mrs. Wessington broke down completely. I turned away and left her to
finish her journey in peace, feeling, but only for a moment or two, that
I had been an unutterably mean hound. I looked back, and saw that she
had turned her 'rickshaw with the idea, I suppose, of overtaking me.

The scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory. The
rain-swept sky (we were at the end of the wet weather), the sodden,
dingy pines, the muddy road, and the black powder-riven cliffs formed a
gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of the
_jhampanies_, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw and Mrs. Wessington's
down-bowed golden head stood out clearly. She was holding her
handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning back exhausted against the
'rickshaw cushions. I turned my horse up a bypath near the Sanjowlie
Reservoir and literally ran away. Once I fancied I heard a faint call of
"Jack!" This may have been imagination. I never stopped to verify it.
Ten minutes later I came across Kitty on horseback; and, in the delight
of a long ride with her, forgot all about the interview.

A week later Mrs. Wessington died, and the inexpressible burden of her
existence was removed from my life. I went Plainsward perfectly happy.
Before three months were over I had forgotten all about her, except that
at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me
unpleasantly of our bygone relationship. By January I had disinterred
what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings
and had burnt it. At the beginning of April of this year, 1885, I was at
Simla--semi-deserted Simla--once more, and was deep in lover's talks and
walks with Kitty. It was decided that we should be married at the end of
June. You will understand, therefore, that, loving Kitty as I did, I am
not saying too much when I pronounce myself to have been, at the time,
the happiest man in India.

Fourteen delightful days passed almost before I noticed their flight.
Then, aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals
circumstanced as we were, I pointed out to Kitty that an engagement-ring
was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl; and
that she must forthwith come to Hamilton's to be measured for one. Up to
that moment, I give you my word, we had completely forgotten so trivial
a matter. To Hamilton's we accordingly went on the 15th of April, 1885.
Remember that--whatever my doctor may say to the contrary--I was then in
perfect health, enjoying a well-balanced mind and an absolutely tranquil
spirit. Kitty and I entered Hamilton's shop together, and there,
regardless of the order of affairs, I measured Kitty's finger for the
ring in the presence of the amused assistant. The ring was a sapphire
with two diamonds. We then rode out down the slope that leads to the
Combermere Bridge and Peliti's shop.

While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale, and
Kitty was laughing and chattering at my side--while all Simla, that is
to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped round
the Reading-room and Peliti's veranda--I was aware that some one,
apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian name. It
struck me that I had heard the voice before, but when and where I could
not at once determine. In the short space it took to cover the road
between the path from Hamilton's shop and the first plank of the
Combermere Bridge I had thought over half-a-dozen people who might have
committed such a solecism, and had eventually decided that it must have
been some singing in my ears. Immediately opposite Peliti's shop my eye
was arrested by the sight of four _jhampanies_ in black and white
livery, pulling a yellow-paneled, cheap, bazar 'rickshaw. In a moment my
mind flew back to the previous season and Mrs. Wessington with a sense
of irritation and disgust. Was it not enough that the woman was dead and
done with, without her black and white servitors re-appearing to spoil
the day's happiness? Whoever employed them now I thought I would call
upon, and ask as a personal favor to change her _jhampanies'_ livery.
I would hire the men myself, and, if necessary, buy their coats from off
their backs. It is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable
memories their presence evoked.

"Kitty," I cried, "there are poor Mrs. Wessington's _jhampanies_ turned
up again! I wonder who has them now?"

Kitty had known Mrs. Wessington slightly last season, and had always
been interested in the sickly woman.

"What? Where?" she asked. "I can't see them anywhere."

Even as she spoke, her horse, swerving from a laden mule, threw himself
directly in front of the advancing 'rickshaw. I had scarcely time to
utter a word of warning when, to my unutterable horror, horse and rider
passed _through_ men and carriage as if they had been thin air.

"What's the matter?" cried Kitty; "what made you call out so foolishly,
Jack? If I _am_ engaged I don't want all creation to know about it.
There was lots of space between the mule and the veranda; and, if you
think I can't ride--There!"

Whereupon willful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in the air, at a
hand-gallop in the direction of the Band-stand; fully expecting, as she
herself afterwards told me, that I should follow her. What was the
matter? Nothing, indeed. Either that I was mad or drunk, or that Simla
was haunted with devils. I reined in my impatient cob, and turned round.
The 'rickshaw had turned too, and now stood immediately facing me, near
the left railing of the Combermere Bridge.

"Jack! Jack, darling." (There was no mistake about the words this time:
they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear.) "It's
some hideous mistake, I'm sure. _Please_ forgive me, Jack, and let's be
friends again."

The 'rickshaw-hood had fallen back, and inside, as I hope and daily pray
for the death I dread by night, sat Mrs. Keith-Wessington, handkerchief
in hand, and golden head bowed on her breast.

How long I stared motionless I do not know. Finally, I was aroused by my
groom taking the Waler's bridle and asking whether I was ill. I tumbled
off my horse and dashed, half fainting, into Peliti's for a glass of
cherry-brandy. There two or three couples were gathered round the
coffee-tables discussing the gossip of the day. Their trivialities were
more comforting to me just then than the consolations of religion could
have been. I plunged into the midst of the conversation at once;
chatted, laughed and jested with a face (when I caught a glimpse of it
in a mirror) as white and drawn as that of a corpse. Three or four men
noticed my condition; and, evidently setting it down to the results of
over many pegs, charitably endeavored to draw me apart from the rest of
the loungers. But I refused to be led away. I wanted the company of my
kind--as a child rushes into the midst of the dinner-party after a
fright in the dark. I must have talked for about ten minutes or so,
though it seemed an eternity to me, when I heard Kitty's dear voice
outside inquiring for me. In another minute she had entered the shop,
prepared to roundly upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties.
Something in my face stopped her.

"Why, Jack," she cried, "what _have_ you been doing? What _has_
happened? Are you ill?" Thus driven into a direct lie, I said that the
sun had been a little too much for me. It was close upon five o'clock of
a cloudy April afternoon, and the sun had been hidden all day. I saw my
mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth: attempted to recover
it; blundered hopelessly and followed Kitty, in a regal rage, out of
doors, amid the smiles of my acquaintances. I made some excuse (I have
forgotten what) on the score of my feeling faint; and cantered away to
my hotel, leaving Kitty to finish the ride by herself.

In my room I sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter. Here
was I, Theobald Jack Pansay, a well-educated Bengal Civilian in the year
of grace 1885, presumably sane, certainly healthy, driven in terror from
my sweetheart's side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead and
buried eight months ago. These were facts that I could not blink.
Nothing was further from my thought than any memory of Mrs. Wessington
when Kitty and I left Hamilton's shop. Nothing was more utterly
commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite Peliti's. It was broad
daylight. The road was full of people; and yet here, look you, in
defiance of every law of probability, in direct outrage of Nature's
ordinance, there had appeared to me a face from the grave.

Kitty's Arab had gone _through_ the 'rickshaw: so that my first hope
that some woman marvelously like Mrs. Wessington had hired the carriage
and the coolies with their old livery was lost. Again and again I went
round this treadmill of thought; and again and again gave up baffled and
in despair. The voice was as inexplicable as the apparition. I had
originally some wild notion of confiding it all to Kitty; of begging her
to marry me at once; and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the
'rickshaw. "After all," I argued, "the presence of the 'rickshaw is in
itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion. One may see
ghosts of men and women, but surely never of coolies and carriages. The
whole thing is absurd. Fancy the ghost of a hill-man!"

Next morning I sent a penitent note to Kitty, imploring her to overlook
my strange conduct of the previous afternoon. My Divinity was still very
wroth, and a personal apology was necessary. I explained, with a fluency
born of night-long pondering over a falsehood, that I had been attacked
with a sudden palpitation of the heart--the result of indigestion. This
eminently practical solution had its effect; and Kitty and I rode out
that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us.

Nothing would please her save a canter round Jakko. With my nerves still
unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,
suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road--anything
rather than the Jakko round. Kitty was angry and a little hurt, so I
yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding, and we set out
together towards Chota Simla. We walked a greater part of the way, and,
according to our custom, cantered from a mile or so below the Convent to
the stretch of level road by the Sanjowlie Reservoir. The wretched
horses appeared to fly, and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we
neared the crest of the ascent. My mind had been full of Mrs. Wessington
all the afternoon; and every inch of the Jakko road bore witness to our
old-time walks and talks. The boulders were full of it; the pines sang
it aloud overhead; the rain-fed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen
over the shameful story; and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity
aloud.

As a fitting climax, in the middle of the level men call the Ladies'
Mile, the Horror was awaiting me. No other 'rickshaw was in sight--only
the four black and white _jhampanies_, the yellow-paneled carriage, and
the golden head of the woman within--all apparently just as I had left
them eight months and one fortnight ago! For an instant I fancied that
Kitty must see what I saw--we were so marvelously sympathetic in all
things. Her next words undeceived me--"Not a soul in sight! Come along,
Jack, and I'll race you to the Reservoir buildings!" Her wiry little
Arab was off like a bird, my Waler following close behind, and in this
order we dashed under the cliffs. Half a minute brought us within fifty
yards of the 'rickshaw. I pulled my Waler and fell back a little. The
'rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road: and once more the Arab
passed through it, my horse following. "Jack, Jack, dear! _Please_
forgive me," rang with a wail in my ears, and, after an interval: "It's
all a mistake, a hideous mistake!"

I spurred my horse like a man possessed. When I turned my head at the
Reservoir works the black and white liveries were still
waiting--patiently waiting--under the gray hillside, and the wind
brought me a mocking echo of the words I had just heard. Kitty bantered
me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride. I had
been talking up till then wildly and at random. To save my life I could
not speak afterwards naturally, and from Sanjowlie to the Church wisely
held my tongue.

I was to dine with the Mannerings that night and had barely time to
canter home to dress. On the road to Elysium Hill I overheard two men
talking together in the dusk--"It's a curious thing," said one, "how
completely all trace of it disappeared. You know my wife was insanely
fond of the woman (never could see anything in her myself) and wanted
me to pick up her old 'rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for
love or money. Morbid sort of fancy I call it, but I've got to do what
the _Memsahib_ tells me. Would you believe that the man she hired it
from tells me that all four of the men, they were brothers, died of
cholera, on the way to HardwÃ¡r, poor devils; and the 'rickshaw has been
broken up by the man himself. Told me he never used a dead _Memsahib's_
'rickshaw. Spoilt his luck. Queer notion, wasn't it? Fancy poor little
Mrs. Wessington spoiling any one's luck except her own!" I laughed aloud
at this point; and my laugh jarred on me as I uttered it. So there
_were_ ghosts of 'rickshaws after all, and ghostly employments in the
other world! How much did Mrs. Wessington give her men? What were their
hours? Where did they go?

And for visible answer to my last question I saw the infernal thing
blocking my path in the twilight. The dead travel fast and by short-cuts
unknown to ordinary coolies. I laughed aloud a second time and checked
my laughter suddenly, for I was afraid I was going mad. Mad to a certain
extent I must have been, for I recollect that I reined in my horse at
the head of the 'rickshaw, and politely wished Mrs. Wessington "good
evening." Her answer was one I knew only too well. I listened to the
end; and replied that I had heard it all before, but should be delighted
if she had anything further to say. Some malignant devil stronger than I
must have entered into me that evening, for I have a dim recollection of
talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to the thing in
front of me.

"Mad as a hatter, poor devil--or drunk. Max, try and get him to come
home."

Surely _that_ was not Mrs. Wessington's voice! The two men had overheard
me speaking to the empty air, and had returned to look after me. They
were very kind and considerate, and from their words evidently gathered
that I was extremely drunk. I thanked them confusedly and cantered away
to my hotel, there changed, and arrived at the Mannerings' ten minutes
late. I pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse; was rebuked by
Kitty for my unlover-like tardiness; and sat down.

The conversation had already become general; and, under cover of it, I
was addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when I was aware
that at the further end of the table a short red-whiskered man was
describing with much broidery his encounter with a mad unknown that
evening. A few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident
of half an hour ago. In the middle of the story he looked round for
applause, as professional story-tellers do, caught my eye, and
straightway collapsed. There was a moment's awkward silence, and the
red-whiskered man muttered something to the effect that he had
"forgotten the rest"; thereby sacrificing a reputation as a good
story-teller which he had built up for six seasons past. I blessed him
from the bottom of my heart and--went on with my fish.

In the fullness of time that dinner came to an end; and with genuine
regret I tore myself away from Kitty--as certain as I was of my own
existence that It would be waiting for me outside the door. The
red-whiskered man, who had been introduced to me as Dr. Heatherlegh of
Simla, volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay together.
I accepted his offer with gratitude.

My instinct had not deceived me. It lay in readiness in the Mall, and,
in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways, with a lighted head-lamp.
The red-whiskered man went to the point at once, in a manner that showed
he had been thinking over it all dinner time.

"I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on
the Elysium road?" The suddenness of the question wrenched an answer
from me before I was aware.

"That!" said I, pointing to It.

"_That_ may be either _D.T._ or eyes for aught I know. Now you don't
liquor. I saw as much at dinner, so it can't be _D.T._ There's nothing
whatever where you're pointing, though you're sweating and trembling
with fright like a scared pony. Therefore, I conclude that it's eyes.
And I ought to understand all about them. Come along home with me. I'm
on the Blessington lower road."

To my intense delight the 'rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept about
twenty yards ahead--and this, too, whether we walked, trotted, or
cantered. In the course of that long night ride I had told my companion
almost as much as I have told you here.

"Well, you've spoilt one of the best tales I've ever laid tongue to,"
said he, "but I'll forgive you for the sake of what you've gone through.
Now come home and do what I tell you; and when I've cured you, young
man, let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and
indigestible food till the day of your death."

The 'rickshaw kept steadily in front; and my red-whiskered friend seemed
to derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts.

"Eyes, Pansay--all eyes, brain and stomach; and the greatest of these
three is stomach. You've too much conceited brain, too little stomach,
and thoroughly unhealthy eyes. Get your stomach straight and the rest
follows. And all that's French for a liver pill. I'll take sole medical
charge of you from this hour; for you're too interesting a phenomenon to
be passed over."

By this time we were deep in the shadow of the Blessington lower road
and the 'rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pine-clad, overhanging
shale cliff. Instinctively I halted too, giving my reason. Heatherlegh
rapped out an oath.

"Now, if you think I'm going to spend a cold night on the hillside for
the sake of a stomach-_cum_-brain-_cum_-eye illusion . . . . Lord ha'
mercy! What's that?"

There was a muffled report, a blinding smother of dust just in front of
us, a crack, the noise of rent boughs, and about ten yards of the
cliffside--pines, undergrowth, and all--slid down into the road below,
completely blocking it up. The uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a
moment like drunken giants in the gloom, and then fell prone among their
fellows with a thunderous crash. Our two horses stood motionless and
sweating with fear. As soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had
subsided, my companion muttered: "Man, if we'd gone forward we should
have been ten feet deep in our graves by now! 'There are more things in
heaven and earth' . . . Come home, Pansay, and thank God. I want a drink
badly."

We retraced our way over the Church Ridge, and I arrived at Dr.
Heatherlegh's house shortly after midnight.

His attempts towards my cure commenced almost immediately, and for a
week I never left his sight. Many a time in the course of that week did
I bless the good fortune which had thrown me in contact with Simla's
best and kindest doctor. Day by day my spirits grew lighter and more
equable. Day by day, too, I became more and more inclined to fall in
with Heatherlegh's "spectral illusion" theory, implicating eyes, brain,
and stomach. I wrote to Kitty, telling her that a slight sprain caused
by a fall from my horse kept me indoors for a few days; and that I
should be recovered before she had time to regret my absence.

Heatherlegh's treatment was simple to a degree. It consisted of
liver-pills, cold-water baths and strong exercise, taken in the dusk or
at early dawn--for, as he sagely observed: "A man with a sprained ankle
doesn't walk a dozen miles a day, and your young woman might be
wondering if she saw you."

At the end of the week, after much examination of pupil and pulse and
strict injunctions as to diet and pedestrianism, Heatherlegh dismissed
me as brusquely as he had taken charge of me. Here is his parting
benediction: "Man, I certify to your mental cure, and that's as much as
to say I've cured most of your bodily ailments. Now, get your traps out
of this as soon as you can; and be off to make love to Miss Kitty."

I was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness. He cut me
short:

"Don't think I did this because I like you. I gather that you've behaved
like a blackguard all through. But, all the same you're a phenomenon,
and as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard. Now, go out and see
if you can find the eyes-brain-and-stomach business again. I'll give you
a lakh for each time you see it."

Half an hour later I was in the Mannerings' drawing-room with
Kitty--drunk with the intoxication of present happiness and the
foreknowledge that I should never more be troubled with It's hideous
presence. Strong in the sense of my new-found security, I proposed a
ride at once; and, by preference, a canter round Jakko.

Never have I felt so well, so overladen with vitality and mere animal
spirits as I did on the afternoon of the 30th of April. Kitty was
delighted at the change in my appearance, and complimented me on it in
her delightfully frank and outspoken manner. We left the Mannerings'
house together, laughing and talking, and cantered along the Chota Simla
road as of old.

I was in haste to reach the Sanjowlie Reservoir and there make my
assurance doubly sure. The horses did their best, but seemed all too
slow to my impatient mind. Kitty was astonished at my boisterousness.
"Why, Jack!" she cried at last, "you are behaving like a child! What are
you doing?"

We were just below the Convent, and from sheer wantonness I was making
my Waler plunge and curvet across the road as I tickled it with the loop
of my riding-whip.

"Doing," I answered, "nothing, dear. That's just it. If you'd been doing
nothing for a week except lie up, you'd be as riotous as I.

          'Singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth,
             Joying to feel yourself alive;
           Lord over nature, Lord of the visible Earth,
             Lord of the senses five.'"

My quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner
above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to
Sanjowlie. In the center of the level road stood the black and white
liveries, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw and Mrs. Keith-Wessington.
I pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe, must have said
something. The next thing I knew was that I was lying face downward on
the road, with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.

"Has it gone, child?" I gasped. Kitty only wept more bitterly.

"Has what gone? Jack dear: what does it all mean? There must be a
mistake somewhere, Jack. A hideous mistake." Her last words brought me
to my feet--mad--raving for the time being.

"Yes, there _is_ a mistake somewhere." I repeated, "a hideous mistake.
Come and look at It!"

I have an indistinct idea that I dragged Kitty by the wrist along the
road up to where It stood, and implored her for pity's sake to speak to
it; to tell It that we were betrothed! that neither Death nor Hell could
break the tie between us; and Kitty only knows how much more to the same
effect. Now and again I appealed passionately to the Terror in the
'rickshaw to bear witness to all I had said, and to release me from a
torture that was killing me. As I talked I suppose I must have told
Kitty of my old relations with Mrs. Wessington, for I saw her listen
intently with white face and blazing eyes.

"Thank you, Mr. Pansay," she said, "that's _quite_ enough. Bring my
horse."

The grooms, impassive as Orientals always are, had come up with the
recaptured horses; and as Kitty sprang into her saddle I caught hold of
the bridle entreating her to hear me out and forgive. My answer was the
cut of her riding-whip across my face from mouth to eye, and a word or
two of farewell that even now I cannot write down. So I judged, and
judged rightly, that Kitty knew all; and I staggered back to the side of
the 'rickshaw. My face was cut and bleeding, and the blow of the
riding-whip had raised a livid blue weal on it. I had no self-respect.
Just then, Heatherlegh, who must have been following Kitty and me at a
distance, cantered up.

"Doctor," I said, pointing to my face, "here's Miss Mannering's
signature to my order of dismissal and . . . I'll thank you for that
lakh as soon as convenient."

Heatherlegh's face, even in my abject misery, moved me to laugh.

"I'll stake my professional reputation"--he began. "Don't be a fool,"
I whispered. "I've lost my life's happiness and you'd better take me
home."

As I spoke the 'rickshaw was gone. Then I lost all knowledge of what was
passing. The crest of Jakko seemed to heave and roll like the crest of a
cloud and fall in upon me.

Seven days later (on the 7th of May, that is to say) I was aware that
I was lying in Heatherlegh's room as weak as a little child. Heatherlegh
was watching me intently from behind the papers on his writing table.
His first words were not very encouraging; but I was too far spent to
be much moved by them.

"Here's Miss Kitty has sent back your letters. You corresponded a good
deal, you young people. Here's a packet that looks like a ring, and a
cheerful sort of a note from Mannering Papa, which I've taken the
liberty of reading and burning. The old gentleman's not pleased with
you."

"And Kitty?" I asked dully.

"Rather more drawn than her father from what she says. By the same token
you must have been letting out any number of queer reminiscences just
before I met you. Says that a man who would have behaved to a woman as
you did to Mrs. Wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity for
his kind. She's a hot-headed little virago, your mash. Will have it too
that you were suffering from _D.T._ when that row on the Jakko road
turned up. Says she'll die before she ever speaks to you again."

I groaned and turned over on the other side.

"Now you've got your choice, my friend. This engagement has to be broken
off; and the Mannerings don't want to be too hard on you. Was it broken
through _D.T._ or epileptic fits? Sorry I can't offer you a better
exchange unless you'd prefer hereditary insanity. Say the word and I'll
tell 'em it's fits. All Simla knows about that scene on the Ladies'
Mile. Come! I'll give you five minutes to think over it."

During those five minutes I believe that I explored thoroughly the
lowest circles of the Inferno which it is permitted man to tread on
earth. And at the same time I myself was watching myself faltering
through the dark labyrinths of doubt, misery, and utter despair.
I wondered, as Heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered, which
dreadful alternative I should adopt. Presently I heard myself answering
in a voice that I hardly recognized:

"They're confoundedly particular about morality in these parts. Give 'em
fits, Heatherlegh, and my love. Now let me sleep a bit longer."

Then my two selves joined, and it was only I (half crazed, devil-driven
I) that tossed in my bed, tracing step by step the history of the past
month.

"But I am in Simla," I kept repeating to myself. "I, Jack Pansay, am in
Simla, and there are no ghosts here. It's unreasonable of that woman to
pretend there are. Why couldn't Agnes have left me alone? I never did
her any harm. It might just as well have been me as Agnes. Only I'd
never have come back on purpose to kill _her_. Why can't I be left
alone--left alone and happy?"

It was high noon when I first awoke: and the sun was low in the sky
before I slept--slept as the tortured criminal sleeps on his rack, too
worn to feel further pain.

Next day I could not leave my bed. Heatherlegh told me in the morning
that he had received an answer from Mr. Mannering, and that, thanks to
his (Heatherlegh's) friendly offices, the story of my affliction had
traveled through the length and breadth of Simla, where I was on all
sides much pitied.

"And that's rather more than you deserve," he concluded pleasantly,
"though the Lord knows you've been going through a pretty severe mill.
Never mind; we'll cure you yet, you perverse phenomenon."

I declined firmly to be cured. "You've been much too good to me already,
old man," said I; "but I don't think I need trouble you further."

In my heart I knew that nothing Heatherlegh could do would lighten the
burden that had been laid upon me.

With that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless, impotent rebellion
against the unreasonableness of it all. There were scores of men no
better than I whose punishments had at least been reserved for another
world and I felt that it was bitterly, cruelly unfair that I alone
should have been singled out for so hideous a fate. This mood would in
time give place to another where it seemed that the 'rickshaw and I were
the only realities in a world of shadows; that Kitty was a ghost; that
Mannering, Heatherlegh, and all the other men and women I knew were all
ghosts and the great, gray hills themselves but vain shadows devised to
torture me. From mood to mood I tossed backwards and forwards for seven
weary days, my body growing daily stronger and stronger, until the
bed-room looking-glass told me that I had returned to everyday life, and
was as other men once more. Curiously enough, my face showed no signs
of the struggle I had gone through. It was pale indeed, but as
expressionless and commonplace as ever. I had expected some permanent
alteration--visible evidence of the disease that was eating me away.
I found nothing.

On the 15th of May I left Heatherlegh's house at eleven o'clock in the
morning; and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the Club. There
I found that every man knew my story as told by Heatherlegh, and was, in
clumsy fashion, abnormally kind and attentive. Nevertheless I recognized
that for the rest of my natural life I should be among, but not of, my
fellows; and I envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on the
Mall below. I lunched at the Club, and at four o'clock wandered
aimlessly down the Mall in the vague hope of meeting Kitty. Close to the
Band-stand the black and white liveries joined me; and I heard Mrs.
Wessington's old appeal at my side. I had been expecting this ever since
I came out; and was only surprised at her delay. The phantom 'rickshaw
and I went side by side along the Chota Simla road in silence. Close to
the bazaar, Kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us. For any
sign she gave I might have been a dog in the road. She did not even pay
me the compliment of quickening her pace; though the rainy afternoon had
served for an excuse.

So Kitty and her companion, and I and my ghostly Light-o'-Love, crept
round Jakko in couples. The road was streaming with water; the pines
dripped like roof-pipes on the rocks below, and the air was full of
fine, driving rain. Two or three times I found myself saying to myself
almost aloud: "I'm Jack Pansay on leave at Simla--_at Simla!_ Everyday,
ordinary Simla. I mustn't forget that--I mustn't forget that." Then I
would try to recollect some of the gossip I had heard at the Club; the
prices of So-and-So's horses--anything, in fact, that related to the
work-a-day Anglo-Indian world I knew so well. I even repeated the
multiplication-table rapidly to myself, to make quite sure that I was
not taking leave of my senses. It gave me much comfort; and must have
prevented my hearing Mrs. Wessington for a time.

Once more I wearily climbed the Convent slope and entered the level
road. Here Kitty and the man started off at a canter, and I was left
alone with Mrs. Wessington. "Agnes," said I, "will you put back your
hood and tell me what it all means?" The hood dropped noiselessly and
I was face to face with my dead and buried mistress. She was wearing
the dress in which I had last seen her alive: carried the same tiny
handkerchief in her right hand; and the same card-case in her left. (A
woman eight months dead with a card-case!) I had to pin myself down to
the multiplication-table, and to set both hands on the stone parapet of
the road to assure myself that that at least was real.

"Agnes," I repeated, "for pity's sake tell me what it all means." Mrs.
Wessington leant forward, with that odd, quick turn of the head I used
to know so well, and spoke.

If my story had not already so madly overleaped the bounds of all human
belief I should apologize to you now. As I know that no one--no, not
even Kitty, for whom it is written as some sort of justification of my
conduct--will believe me, I will go on. Mrs. Wessington spoke and I
walked with her from the Sanjowlie road to the turning below the
Commander-in-Chief's house as I might walk by the side of any living
woman's 'rickshaw, deep in conversation. The second and most tormenting
of my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me, and like the
prince in Tennyson's poem, "I seemed to move amid a world of ghosts."
There had been a garden-party at the Commander-in-Chief's, and we two
joined the crowd of homeward-bound folk. As I saw them then it seemed
that _they_ were the shadows--impalpable fantastic shadows--that divided
for Mrs. Wessington's 'rickshaw to pass through. What we said during the
course of that weird interview I cannot--indeed, I dare not--tell.
Heatherlegh's comment would have been a short laugh and a remark that I
had been "mashing a brain-eye-and-stomach chimera." It was a ghastly and
yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience. Could it be
possible, I wondered, that I was in this life to woo a second time the
woman I had killed by my own neglect and cruelty?

I met Kitty on the homeward road--a shadow among shadows.

If I were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their
order, my story would never come to an end; and your patience would be
exhausted. Morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly
'rickshaw and I used to wander through Simla together. Wherever I went,
there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company
to and from my hotel. At the theater I found them amid the crowd of
yelling _jhampanies_; outside the club veranda, after a long evening of
whist; at the birthday ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and
in broad daylight when I went calling. Save that it cast no shadow, the
'rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and
iron. More than once, indeed, I have had to check myself from warning
some hard-riding friend against cantering over it. More than once I have
walked down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington to the
unspeakable amazement of the passers-by.

Before I had been out and about a week I learnt that the "fit" theory
had been discarded in favor of insanity. However, I made no change in my
mode of life. I called, rode, and dined out as freely as ever. I had a
passion for the society of my kind which I had never felt before; I
hungered to be among the realities of life; and at the same time I felt
vaguely unhappy when I had been separated too long from my ghostly
companion. It would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods
from the 15th of May up to to-day.

The presence of the 'rickshaw filled me by turns with horror, blind
fear, a dim sort of pleasure, and utter despair. I dared not leave
Simla; and I knew that my stay there was killing me. I knew, moreover,
that it was my destiny to die slowly and a little every day. My only
anxiety was to get the penance over as quietly as might be. Alternately
I hungered for a sight of Kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations
with my successor--to speak more accurately, my successors--with amused
interest. She was as much out of my life as I was out of hers. By day
I wandered with Mrs. Wessington almost content. By night I implored
Heaven to let me return to the world as I used to know it. Above all
these varying moods lay the sensation of dull, numbing wonder that the
seen and the unseen should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound
one poor soul to its grave.

       *       *       *       *       *

_August 27th._--Heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on
me; and only yesterday told me that I ought to send in an application
for sick-leave. An application to escape the company of a phantom! A
request that the Government would graciously permit me to get rid of
five ghosts and an airy 'rickshaw by going to England! Heatherlegh's
proposition moved me to almost hysterical laughter. I told him that
I should await the end quietly at Simla; and I am sure that the end is
not far off. Believe me that I dread its advent more than any word can
say; and I torture myself nightly with a thousand speculations as to
the manner of my death.

Shall I die in my bed decently and as an English gentlemen should die;
or, in one last walk on the Mall, will my soul be wrenched from me to
take its place for ever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm?
Shall I return to my old lost allegiance in the next world, or shall
I meet Agnes loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity?
Shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of time? As
the day of my death draws nearer, the intense horror that all living
flesh feels towards escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and
more powerful. It is an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with
scarcely one half of your life completed. It is a thousand times more
awful to wait as I do in your midst, for I know not what unimaginable
terror. Pity me, at least on the score of my "delusion," for I know you
will never believe what I have written here. Yet as surely as ever a man
was done to death by the Powers of Darkness I am that man.

In justice, too, pity her. For as surely as ever woman was killed by
man, I killed Mrs. Wessington. And the last portion of my punishment is
even now upon me.




THE RIVAL GHOSTS

BY BRANDER MATTHEWS


The good ship sped on her way across the calm Atlantic. It was an
outward passage, according to the little charts which the company had
charily distributed, but most of the passengers were homeward bound,
after a summer of rest and recreation, and they were counting the days
before they might hope to see Fire Island Light. On the lee side of the
boat, comfortably sheltered from the wind, and just by the door of the
captain's room (which was theirs during the day), sat a little group of
returning Americans. The Duchess (she was down on the purser's list as
Mrs. Martin, but her friends and familiars called her the Duchess of
Washington Square) and Baby Van Rensselaer (she was quite old enough to
vote, had her sex been entitled to that duty, but as the younger of two
sisters she was still the baby of the family)--the Duchess and Baby Van
Rensselaer were discussing the pleasant English voice and the not
unpleasant English accent of a manly young lordling who was going to
America for sport. Uncle Larry and Dear Jones were enticing each other
into a bet on the ship's run of the morrow.

"I'll give you two to one she don't make 420," said Dear Jones.

"I'll take it," answered Uncle Larry. "We made 427 the fifth day last
year." It was Uncle Larry's seventeenth visit to Europe, and this was
therefore his thirty-fourth voyage.

"And when did you get in?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer. "I don't care a
bit about the run, so long as we get in soon."

"We crossed the bar Sunday night, just seven days after we left
Queenstown, and we dropped anchor off Quarantine at three o'clock on
Monday morning."

"I hope we shan't do that this time. I can't seem to sleep any when the
boat stops."

"I can; but I didn't," continued Uncle Larry; "because my state-room was
the most for'ard in the boat, and the donkey-engine that let down the
anchor was right over my head."

"So you got up and saw the sunrise over the bay," said Dear Jones, "with
the electric lights of the city twinkling in the distance, and the first
faint flush of the dawn in the east just over Fort Lafayette, and the
rosy tinge which spread softly upward, and----"

"Did you both come back together?" asked the Duchess.

"Because he has crossed thirty-four times you must not suppose that he
has a monopoly in sunrises," retorted Dear Jones. "No, this was my own
sunrise; and a mighty pretty one it was, too."

"I'm not matching sunrises with you," remarked Uncle Larry, calmly; "but
I'm willing to back a merry jest called forth by my sunrise against any
two merry jests called forth by yours."

"I confess reluctantly that my sunrise evoked no merry jest at all."
Dear Jones was an honest man, and would scorn to invent a merry jest on
the spur of the moment.

"That's where my sunrise has the call," said Uncle Larry, complacently.

"What was the merry jest?" was Baby Van Rensselaer's inquiry, the
natural result of a feminine curiosity thus artistically excited.

"Well, here it is. I was standing aft, near a patriotic American and a
wandering Irishman, and the patriotic American rashly declared that you
couldn't see a sunrise like that anywhere in Europe, and this gave the
Irishman his chance, and he said, 'Sure ye don't have 'em here till
we're through with 'em over there.'"

"It is true," said Dear Jones, thoughtfully, "that they do have some
things over there better than we do; for instance, umbrellas."

"And gowns," added the Duchess.

"And antiquities,"--this was Uncle Larry's contribution.

"And we do have some things so much better in America!" protested Baby
Van Rensselaer, as yet uncorrupted by any worship of the effete
monarchies of despotic Europe. "We make lots of things a great deal
nicer than you can get them in Europe--especially ice-cream."

"And pretty girls," added Dear Jones; but he did not look at her.

"And spooks," remarked Uncle Larry casually.

"Spooks?" queried the Duchess.

"Spooks. I maintain the word. Ghosts, if you like that better, or
specters. We turn out the best quality of spook----"

"You forget the lovely ghost stories about the Rhine, and the Black
Forest," interrupted Miss Van Rensselaer, with feminine inconsistency.

"I remember the Rhine and the Black Forest and all the other haunts of
elves and fairies and hobgoblins; but for good honest spooks there is no
place like home. And what differentiates our spook--_Spiritus
Americanus_--from the ordinary ghost of literature is that it responds
to the American sense of humor. Take Irving's stories for example. _The
Headless Horseman_, that's a comic ghost story. And Rip Van
Winkle--consider what humor, and what good-humor, there is in the
telling of his meeting with the goblin crew of Hendrik Hudson's men! A
still better example of this American way of dealing with legend and
mystery is the marvelous tale of the rival ghosts."

"The rival ghosts?" queried the Duchess and Baby Van Rensselaer
together. "Who were they?"

"Didn't I ever tell you about them?" answered Uncle Larry, a gleam of
approaching joy flashing from his eye.

"Since he is bound to tell us sooner or later, we'd better be resigned
and hear it now," said Dear Jones.

"If you are not more eager, I won't tell it at all."

"Oh, do, Uncle Larry; you know I just dote on ghost stories," pleaded
Baby Van Rensselaer.

"Once upon a time," began Uncle Larry--"in fact, a very few years
ago--there lived in the thriving town of New York a young American
called Duncan--Eliphalet Duncan. Like his name, he was half Yankee and
half Scotch, and naturally he was a lawyer, and had come to New York to
make his way. His father was a Scotchman, who had come over and settled
in Boston, and married a Salem girl. When Eliphalet Duncan was about
twenty he lost both of his parents. His father left him with enough
money to give him a start, and a strong feeling of pride in his Scotch
birth; you see there was a title in the family in Scotland, and although
Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger son, yet he always
remembered, and always bade his only son to remember, that his ancestry
was noble. His mother left him her full share of Yankee grit, and a
little house in Salem which has belonged to her family for more than two
hundred years. She was a Hitchcock, and the Hitchcocks had been settled
in Salem since the year 1. It was a great-great-grandfather of Mr.
Eliphalet Hitchcock who was foremost in the time of the Salem witchcraft
craze. And this little old house which she left to my friend Eliphalet
Duncan was haunted.

"By the ghost of one of the witches, of course," interrupted Dear Jones.

"Now how could it be the ghost of a witch, since the witches were all
burned at the stake? You never heard of anybody who was burned having a
ghost, did you?"

"That's an argument in favor of cremation, at any rate," replied Jones,
evading the direct question.

"It is, if you don't like ghosts; I do," said Baby Van Rensselaer.

"And so do I," added Uncle Larry. "I love a ghost as dearly as an
Englishman loves a lord."

"Go on with your story," said the Duchess, majestically overruling all
extraneous discussion.

"This little old house at Salem was haunted," resumed Uncle Larry. "And
by a very distinguished ghost--or at least by a ghost with very
remarkable attributes."

"What was he like?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a premonitory shiver
of anticipatory delight.

"It had a lot of peculiarities. In the first place, it never appeared to
the master of the house. Mostly it confined its visitations to unwelcome
guests. In the course of the last hundred years it had frightened away
four successive mothers-in-law, while never intruding on the head of the
household."

"I guess that ghost had been one of the boys when he was alive and in
the flesh." This was Dear Jones's contribution to the telling of the
tale.

"In the second place," continued Uncle Larry, "it never frightened
anybody the first time it appeared. Only on the second visit were the
ghost-seers scared; but then they were scared enough for twice, and they
rarely mustered up courage enough to risk a third interview. One of the
most curious characteristics of this well-meaning spook was that it had
no face--or at least that nobody ever saw its face."

"Perhaps he kept his countenance veiled?" queried the Duchess, who was
beginning to remember that she never did like ghost stories.

"That was what I was never able to find out. I have asked several people
who saw the ghost, and none of them could tell me anything about its
face, and yet while in its presence they never noticed its features, and
never remarked on their absence or concealment. It was only afterward
when they tried to recall calmly all the circumstances of meeting with
the mysterious stranger, that they became aware that they had not seen
its face. And they could not say whether the features were covered, or
whether they were wanting, or what the trouble was. They knew only that
the face was never seen. And no matter how often they might see it, they
never fathomed this mystery. To this day nobody knows whether the ghost
which used to haunt the little old house in Salem had a face, or what
manner of face it had."

"How awfully weird!" said Baby Van Rensselaer. "And why did the ghost go
away?"

"I haven't said it went away," answered Uncle Larry, with much dignity.

"But you said it _used_ to haunt the little old house at Salem, so I
supposed it had moved. Didn't it?"

"You shall be told in due time. Eliphalet Duncan used to spend most of
his summer vacations at Salem, and the ghost never bothered him at all,
for he was the master of the house--much to his disgust, too, because
he wanted to see for himself the mysterious tenant at will of his
property. But he never saw it, never. He arranged with friends to call
him whenever it might appear, and he slept in the next room with the
door open; and yet when their frightened cries waked him the ghost was
gone, and his only reward was to hear reproachful sighs as soon as he
went back to bed. You see, the ghost thought it was not fair of
Eliphalet to seek an introduction which was plainly unwelcome."

Dear Jones interrupted the story-teller by getting up and tucking a
heavy rug snugly around Baby Van Rensselaer's feet, for the sky was now
overcast and gray, and the air was damp and penetrating.

"One fine spring morning," pursued Uncle Larry, "Eliphalet Duncan
received great news. I told you that there was a title in the family in
Scotland, and that Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger
son. Well, it happened that all Eliphalet's father's brothers and uncles
had died off without male issue except the eldest son of the eldest, and
he, of course, bore the title, and was Baron Duncan of Duncan. Now the
great news that Eliphalet Duncan received in New York one fine spring
morning was that Baron Duncan and his only son had been yachting in the
Hebrides, and they had been caught in a black squall, and they were both
dead. So my friend Eliphalet Duncan inherited the title and the
estates."

"How romantic!" said the Duchess. "So he was a baron!"

"Well," answered Uncle Larry, "he was a baron if he chose. But he didn't
choose."

"More fool he," said Dear Jones sententiously.

"Well," answered Uncle Larry, "I'm not so sure of that. You see,
Eliphalet Duncan was half Scotch and half Yankee, and he had two eyes to
the main chance. He held his tongue about his windfall of luck until he
could find out whether the Scotch estates were enough to keep up the
Scotch title. He soon discovered that they were not, and that the late
Lord Duncan, having married money, kept up such state as he could out of
the revenues of the dowry of Lady Duncan. And Eliphalet, he decided
that he would rather be a well-fed lawyer in New York, living
comfortably on his practice, than a starving lord in Scotland, living
scantily on his title."

"But he kept his title?" asked the Duchess.

"Well," answered Uncle Larry, "he kept it quiet. I knew it, and a friend
or two more. But Eliphalet was a sight too smart to put Baron Duncan of
Duncan, Attorney and Counselor at Law, on his shingle."

"What has all this got to do with your ghost?" asked Dear Jones
pertinently.

"Nothing with that ghost, but a good deal with another ghost. Eliphalet
was very learned in spirit lore--perhaps because he owned the haunted
house at Salem, perhaps because he was a Scotchman by descent. At all
events, he had made a special study of the wraiths and white ladies and
banshees and bogies of all kinds whose sayings and doings and warnings
are recorded in the annals of the Scottish nobility. In fact, he was
acquainted with the habits of every reputable spook in the Scotch
peerage. And he knew that there was a Duncan ghost attached to the
person of the holder of the title of Baron Duncan of Duncan."

"So, besides being the owner of a haunted house in Salem, he was also a
haunted man in Scotland?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer.

"Just so. But the Scotch ghost was not unpleasant, like the Salem ghost,
although it had one peculiarity in common with its trans-Atlantic
fellow-spook. It never appeared to the holder of the title, just as the
other never was visible to the owner of the house. In fact, the Duncan
ghost was never seen at all. It was a guardian angel only. Its sole duty
was to be in personal attendance on Baron Duncan of Duncan, and to warn
him of impending evil. The traditions of the house told that the Barons
of Duncan had again and again felt a premonition of ill fortune. Some of
them had yielded and withdrawn from the venture they had undertaken, and
it had failed dismally. Some had been obstinate, and had hardened their
hearts, and had gone on reckless of defeat and to death. In no case had
a Lord Duncan been exposed to peril without fair warning."

"Then how came it that the father and son were lost in the yacht off the
Hebrides?" asked Dear Jones.

"Because they were too enlightened to yield to superstition. There is
extant now a letter of Lord Duncan, written to his wife a few minutes
before he and his son set sail, in which he tells her how hard he has
had to struggle with an almost overmastering desire to give up the trip.
Had he obeyed the friendly warning of the family ghost, the latter would
have been spared a journey across the Atlantic."

"Did the ghost leave Scotland for America as soon as the old baron
died?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with much interest.

"How did he come over," queried Dear Jones--"in the steerage, or as a
cabin passenger?"

"I don't know," answered Uncle Larry calmly, "and Eliphalet, he didn't
know. For as he was in no danger, and stood in no need of warning, he
couldn't tell whether the ghost was on duty or not. Of course he was on
the watch for it all the time. But he never got any proof of its
presence until he went down to the little old house of Salem, just
before the Fourth of July. He took a friend down with him--a young
fellow who had been in the regular army since the day Fort Sumter was
fired on, and who thought that after four years of the little
unpleasantness down South, including six months in Libby, and after ten
years of fighting the bad Indians on the plains, he wasn't likely to be
much frightened by a ghost. Well, Eliphalet and the officer sat out on
the porch all the evening smoking and talking over points in military
law. A little after twelve o'clock, just as they began to think it was
about time to turn in, they heard the most ghastly noise in the house.
It wasn't a shriek, or a howl, or a yell, or anything they could put a
name to. It was an undeterminate, inexplicable shiver and shudder of
sound, which went wailing out of the window. The officer had been at
Cold Harbor, but he felt himself getting colder this time. Eliphalet
knew it was the ghost who haunted the house. As this weird sound died
away, it was followed by another, sharp, short, blood-curdling in its
intensity. Something in this cry seemed familiar to Eliphalet, and he
felt sure that it proceeded from the family ghost, the warning wraith
of the Duncans."

"Do I understand you to intimate that both ghosts were there together?"
inquired the Duchess anxiously.

"Both of them were there," answered Uncle Larry. "You see, one of them
belonged to the house, and had to be there all the time, and the other
was attached to the person of Baron Duncan, and had to follow him there;
wherever he was there was the ghost also. But Eliphalet, he had scarcely
time to think this out when he heard both sounds again, not one after
another, but both together, and something told him--some sort of an
instinct he had--that those two ghosts didn't agree, didn't get on
together, didn't exactly hit it off; in fact, that they were
quarreling."

"Quarreling ghosts! Well, I never!" was Baby Van Rensselaer's remark.

"It is a blessed thing to see ghosts dwell together in unity," said Dear
Jones.

And the Duchess added, "It would certainly be setting a better example."

"You know," resumed Uncle Larry, "that two waves of light or of sound
may interfere and produce darkness or silence. So it was with these
rival spooks. They interfered, but they did not produce silence or
darkness. On the contrary, as soon as Eliphalet and the officer went
into the house, there began at once a series of spiritualistic
manifestations, a regular dark sÃ©ance. A tambourine was played upon, a
bell was rung, and a flaming banjo went singing around the room."

"Where did they get the banjo?" asked Dear Jones skeptically.

"I don't know. Materialized it, maybe, just as they did the tambourine.
You don't suppose a quiet New York lawyer kept a stock of musical
instruments large enough to fit out a strolling minstrel troupe just on
the chance of a pair of ghosts coming to give him a surprise party, do
you? Every spook has its own instrument of torture. Angels play on
harps, I'm informed, and spirits delight in banjos and tambourines.
These spooks of Eliphalet Duncan's were ghosts with all the modern
improvements, and I guess they were capable of providing their own
musical weapons. At all events, they had them there in the little old
house at Salem the night Eliphalet and his friend came down. And they
played on them, and they rang the bell, and they rapped here, there, and
everywhere. And they kept it up all night."

"All night?" asked the awe-stricken Duchess.

"All night long," said Uncle Larry solemnly; "and the next night, too.
Eliphalet did not get a wink of sleep, neither did his friend. On the
second night the house ghost was seen by the officer; on the third night
it showed itself again; and the next morning the officer packed his
grip-sack and took the first train to Boston. He was a New Yorker, but
he said he'd sooner go to Boston than see that ghost again. Eliphalet,
he wasn't scared at all, partly because he never saw either the
domiciliary or the titular spook, and partly because he felt himself on
friendly terms with the spirit world, and didn't scare easily. But after
losing three nights' sleep and the society of his friend, he began to be
a little impatient, and to think that the thing had gone far enough. You
see, while in a way he was fond of ghosts, yet he liked them best one at
a time. Two ghosts were one too many. He wasn't bent on making a
collection of spooks. He and one ghost were company, but he and two
ghosts were a crowd."

"What did he do?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer.

"Well, he couldn't do anything. He waited awhile, hoping they would get
tired; but he got tired out first. You see, it comes natural to a spook
to sleep in the daytime, but a man wants to sleep nights, and they
wouldn't let him sleep nights. They kept on wrangling and quarreling
incessantly; they manifested and they dark-sÃ©anced as regularly as the
old clock on the stairs struck twelve; they rapped and they rang bells
and they banged the tambourine and they threw the flaming banjo about
the house, and worse than all, they swore."

"I did not know that spirits were addicted to bad language," said the
Duchess.

"How did he know they were swearing? Could he hear them?" asked Dear
Jones.

"That was just it," responded Uncle Larry; "he could not hear them--at
least not distinctly. There were inarticulate murmurs and stifled
rumblings. But the impression produced on him was that they were
swearing. If they had only sworn right out, he would not have minded it
so much, because he would have known the worst. But the feeling that the
air was full of suppressed profanity was very wearing and after standing
it for a week, he gave up in disgust and went to the White Mountains."

"Leaving them to fight it out, I suppose," interjected Baby Van
Rensselaer.

"Not at all," explained Uncle Larry. "They could not quarrel unless he
was present. You see, he could not leave the titular ghost behind him,
and the domiciliary ghost could not leave the house. When he went away
he took the family ghost with him, leaving the house ghost behind. Now
spooks can't quarrel when they are a hundred miles apart any more than
men can."

"And what happened afterward?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a pretty
impatience.

"A most marvelous thing happened. Eliphalet Duncan went to the White
Mountains, and in the car of the railroad that runs to the top of Mount
Washington he met a classmate whom he had not seen for years, and this
classmate introduced Duncan to his sister, and this sister was a
remarkably pretty girl, and Duncan fell in love with her at first sight,
and by the time he got to the top of Mount Washington he was so deep in
love that he began to consider his own unworthiness, and to wonder
whether she might ever be induced to care for him a little--ever so
little."

"I don't think that is so marvelous a thing," said Dear Jones glancing
at Baby Van Rensselaer.

"Who was she?" asked the Duchess, who had once lived in Philadelphia.

"She was Miss Kitty Sutton, of San Francisco, and she was a daughter of
old Judge Sutton, of the firm of Pixley and Sutton."

"A very respectable family," assented the Duchess.

"I hope she wasn't a daughter of that loud and vulgar old Mrs. Sutton
whom I met at Saratoga, one summer, four or five years ago?" said Dear
Jones.

"Probably she was."

"She was a horrid old woman. The boys used to call her Mother Gorgon."

"The pretty Kitty Sutton with whom Eliphalet Duncan had fallen in love
was the daughter of Mother Gorgon. But he never saw the mother, who was
in 'Frisco, or Los Angeles, or Santa Fe, or somewhere out West, and he
saw a great deal of the daughter, who was up in the White Mountains. She
was traveling with her brother and his wife, and as they journeyed from
hotel to hotel, Duncan went with them, and filled out the quartette.
Before the end of the summer he began to think about proposing. Of
course he had lots of chances, going on excursions as they were every
day. He made up his mind to seize the first opportunity, and that very
evening he took her out for a moonlight row on Lake Winnipiseogee. As he
handed her into the boat he resolved to do it, and he had a glimmer of a
suspicion that she knew he was going to do it, too."

"Girls," said Dear Jones, "never go out in a rowboat at night with a
young man unless you mean to accept him."

"Sometimes it's best to refuse him, and get it over once for all," said
Baby Van Rensselaer.

"As Eliphalet took the oars he felt a sudden chill. He tried to shake it
off, but in vain. He began to have a growing consciousness of impending
evil. Before he had taken ten strokes--and he was a swift oarsman--he
was aware of a mysterious presence between him and Miss Sutton."

"Was it the guardian-angel ghost warning him off the match?" interrupted
Dear Jones.

"That's just what it was," said Uncle Larry. "And he yielded to it, and
kept his peace, and rowed Miss Sutton back to the hotel with his
proposal unspoken."

"More fool he," said Dear Jones. "It will take more than one ghost to
keep me from proposing when my mind is made up." And he looked at Baby
Van Rensselaer.

"The next morning," continued Uncle Larry, "Eliphalet overslept
himself, and when he went down to a late breakfast he found that the
Suttons had gone to New York by the morning train. He wanted to follow
them at once, and again he felt the mysterious presence overpowering his
will. He struggled two days, and at last he roused himself to do what he
wanted in spite of the spook. When he arrived in New York it was late in
the evening. He dressed himself hastily and went to the hotel where the
Suttons put up, in the hope of seeing at least her brother. The guardian
angel fought every inch of the walk with him, until he began to wonder
whether, if Miss Sutton were to take him, the spook would forbid the
banns. At the hotel he saw no one that night, and he went home
determined to call as early as he could the next afternoon, and make an
end of it. When he left his office about two o'clock the next day to
learn his fate, he had not walked five blocks before he discovered that
the wraith of the Duncans had withdrawn his opposition to the suit.
There was no feeling of impending evil, no resistance, no struggle, no
consciousness of an opposing presence. Eliphalet was greatly encouraged.
He walked briskly to the hotel; he found Miss Sutton alone. He asked her
the question, and got his answer."

"She accepted him, of course," said Baby Van Rensselaer.

"Of course," said Uncle Larry. "And while they were in the first flush
of joy, swapping confidences and confessions, her brother came into the
parlor with an expression of pain on his face and a telegram in his
hand. The former was caused by the latter, which was from 'Frisco, and
which announced the sudden death of Mrs. Sutton, their mother."

"And that was why the ghost no longer opposed the match?" questioned
Dear Jones.

"Exactly. You see, the family ghost knew that Mother Gorgon was an awful
obstacle to Duncan's happiness, so it warned him. But the moment the
obstacle was removed, it gave its consent at once."

The fog was lowering its thick damp curtain, and it was beginning to be
difficult to see from one end of the boat to the other. Dear Jones
tightened the rug which enwrapped Baby Van Rensselaer, and then withdrew
again into his own substantial coverings.

Uncle Larry paused in his story long enough to light another of the tiny
cigars he always smoked.

"I infer that Lord Duncan"--the Duchess was scrupulous in the bestowal
of titles--"saw no more of the ghosts after he was married."

"He never saw them at all, at any time, either before or since. But they
came very near breaking off the match, and thus breaking two young
hearts."

"You don't mean to say that they knew any just cause or impediment why
they should not forever after hold their peace?" asked Dear Jones.

"How could a ghost, or even two ghosts, keep a girl from marrying the
man she loved?" This was Baby Van Rensselaer's question.

"It seems curious, doesn't it?" and Uncle Larry tried to warm himself by
two or three sharp pulls at his fiery little cigar. "And the
circumstances are quite as curious as the fact itself. You see, Miss
Sutton wouldn't be married for a year after her mother's death, so she
and Duncan had lots of time to tell each other all they knew. Eliphalet,
he got to know a good deal about the girls she went to school with, and
Kitty, she learned all about his family. He didn't tell her about the
title for a long time, as he wasn't one to brag. But he described to her
the little old house at Salem. And one evening toward the end of the
summer, the wedding-day having been appointed for early in September,
she told him that she didn't want to bridal tour at all; she just wanted
to go down to the little old house at Salem to spend her honeymoon in
peace and quiet, with nothing to do and nobody to bother them. Well,
Eliphalet jumped at the suggestion. It suited him down to the ground.
All of a sudden he remembered the spooks, and it knocked him all of a
heap. He had told her about the Duncan Banshee, and the idea of having
an ancestral ghost in personal attendance on her husband tickled her
immensely. But he had never said anything about the ghost which haunted
the little old house at Salem. He knew she would be frightened out of
her wits if the house ghost revealed itself to her, and he saw at once
that it would be impossible to go to Salem on their wedding trip. So he
told her all about it, and how whenever he went to Salem the two ghosts
interfered, and gave dark sÃ©ances and manifested and materialized and
made the place absolutely impossible. Kitty, she listened in silence,
and Eliphalet, he thought she had changed her mind. But she hadn't done
anything of the kind."

"Just like a man--to think she was going to," remarked Baby Van
Rensselaer.

"She just told him she could not bear ghosts herself, but she would not
marry a man who was afraid of them."

"Just like a girl--to be so inconsistent," remarked Dear Jones.

Uncle Larry's tiny cigar had long been extinct. He lighted a new one,
and continued: "Eliphalet protested in vain. Kitty said her mind was
made up. She was determined to pass her honeymoon in the little old
house at Salem, and she was equally determined not to go there as long
as there were any ghosts there. Until he could assure her that the
spectral tenants had received notice to quit, and that there was no
danger of manifestations and materializing, she refused to be married at
all. She did not intend to have her honeymoon interrupted by two
wrangling ghosts, and the wedding could be postponed until he had made
ready the house for her."

"She was an unreasonable young woman," said the Duchess.

"Well, that's what Eliphalet thought, much as he was in love with her.
And he believed he could talk her out of her determination. But he
couldn't. She was set. And when a girl is set, there's nothing to do but
yield to the inevitable. And that's just what Eliphalet did. He saw he
would either have to give her up or to get the ghosts out; and as he
loved her and did not care for the ghosts, he resolved to tackle the
ghosts. He had clear grit, Eliphalet had--he was half Scotch and half
Yankee, and neither breed turns tail in a hurry. So he made his plans
and he went down to Salem. As he said good-by to Kitty he had an
impression that she was sorry she had made him go, but she kept up
bravely, and put a bold face on it, and saw him off, and went home and
cried for an hour, and was perfectly miserable until he came back the
next day."

"Did he succeed in driving the ghosts away?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer,
with great interest.

"That's just what I'm coming to," said Uncle Larry, pausing at the
critical moment, in the manner of the trained story teller. "You see,
Eliphalet had got a rather tough job, and he would gladly have had an
extension of time on the contract, but he had to choose between the girl
and the ghosts, and he wanted the girl. He tried to invent or remember
some short and easy way with ghosts, but he couldn't. He wished that
somebody had invented a specific for spooks--something that would make
the ghosts come out of the house and die in the yard. He wondered if he
could not tempt the ghosts to run in debt, so that he might get the
sheriff to help him. He wondered also whether the ghosts could not be
overcome with strong drink--a dissipated spook, a spook with delirium
tremens, might be committed to the inebriate asylum. But none of these
things seemed feasible."

"What did he do?" interrupted Dear Jones. "The learned counsel will
please speak to the point."

"You will regret this unseemly haste," said Uncle Larry, gravely, "when
you know what really happened."

"What was it, Uncle Larry?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer. "I'm all
impatience."

And Uncle Larry proceeded:

"Eliphalet went down to the little old house at Salem, and as soon as
the clock struck twelve the rival ghosts began wrangling as before. Raps
here, there, and everywhere, ringing bells, banging tambourines,
strumming banjos sailing about the room, and all the other
manifestations and materializations followed one another just as they
had the summer before. The only difference Eliphalet could detect was a
stronger flavor in the spectral profanity; and this, of course, was only
a vague impression, for he did not actually hear a single word. He
waited awhile in patience, listening and watching. Of course he never
saw either of the ghosts, because neither of them could appear to him.
At last he got his dander up, and he thought it was about time to
interfere, so he rapped on the table, and asked for silence. As soon as
he felt that the spooks were listening to him he explained the situation
to them. He told them he was in love, and that he could not marry unless
they vacated the house. He appealed to them as old friends, and he laid
claim to their gratitude. The titular ghost had been sheltered by the
Duncan family for hundreds of years, and the domiciliary ghost had had
free lodging in the little old house at Salem for nearly two centuries.
He implored them to settle their differences, and to get him out of his
difficulty at once. He suggested they'd better fight it out then and
there, and see who was master. He had brought down with him all needful
weapons. And he pulled out his valise, and spread on the table a pair of
navy revolvers, a pair of shot-guns, a pair of dueling swords, and a
couple of bowie-knives. He offered to serve as second for both parties,
and to give the word when to begin. He also took out of his valise a
pack of cards and a bottle of poison, telling them that if they wished
to avoid carnage they might cut the cards to see which one should take
the poison. Then he waited anxiously for their reply. For a little space
there was silence. Then he became conscious of a tremulous shivering in
one corner of the room, and he remembered that he had heard from that
direction what sounded like a frightened sigh when he made the first
suggestion of the duel. Something told him that this was the domiciliary
ghost, and that it was badly scared. Then he was impressed by a certain
movement in the opposite corner of the room, as though the titular ghost
were drawing himself up with offended dignity. Eliphalet couldn't
exactly see these things, because he never saw the ghosts, but he felt
them. After a silence of nearly a minute a voice came from the corner
where the family ghost stood--a voice strong and full, but trembling
slightly with suppressed passion. And this voice told Eliphalet it was
plain enough that he had not long been the head of the Duncans, and that
he had never properly considered the characteristics of his race if now
he supposed that one of his blood could draw his sword against a woman.
Eliphalet said he had never suggested that the Duncan ghost should raise
his hand against a woman and all he wanted was that the Duncan ghost
should fight the other ghost. And then the voice told Eliphalet that the
other ghost was a woman."

"What?" said Dear Jones, sitting up suddenly. "You don't mean to tell me
that the ghost which haunted the house was a woman?"

"Those were the very words Eliphalet Duncan used," said Uncle Larry;
"but he did not need to wait for the answer. All at once he recalled the
traditions about the domiciliary ghost, and he knew that what the
titular ghost said was the fact. He had never thought of the sex of a
spook, but there was no doubt whatever that the house ghost was a woman.
No sooner was this firmly fixed in Eliphalet's mind than he saw his way
out of the difficulty. The ghosts must be married!--for then there would
be no more interference, no more quarreling, no more manifestations and
materializations, no more dark sÃ©ances, with their raps and bells and
tambourines and banjos. At first the ghosts would not hear of it. The
voice in the corner declared that the Duncan wraith had never thought of
matrimony. But Eliphalet argued with them, and pleaded and persuaded and
coaxed, and dwelt on the advantages of matrimony. He had to confess, of
course, that he did not know how to get a clergyman to marry them; but
the voice from the corner gravely told him that there need be no
difficulty in regard to that, as there was no lack of spiritual
chaplains. Then, for the first time, the house ghost spoke, in a low,
clear, gentle voice, and with a quaint, old-fashioned New England
accent, which contrasted sharply with the broad Scotch speech of the
family ghost. She said that Eliphalet Duncan seemed to have forgotten
that she was married. But this did not upset Eliphalet at all; he
remembered the whole case clearly, and he told her she was not a married
ghost, but a widow, since her husband had been hung for murdering her.
Then the Duncan ghost drew attention to the great disparity of their
ages, saying that he was nearly four hundred and fifty years old, while
she was barely two hundred. But Eliphalet had not talked to juries for
nothing; he just buckled to, and coaxed those ghosts into matrimony.
Afterward he came to the conclusion that they were willing to be coaxed,
but at the time he thought he had pretty hard work to convince them of
the advantages of the plan."

"Did he succeed?" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a young lady's
interest in matrimony.

"He did," said Uncle Larry. "He talked the wraith of the Duncans and the
specter of the little old house at Salem into a matrimonial engagement.
And from the time they were engaged he had no more trouble with them.
They were rival ghosts no longer. They were married by their spiritual
chaplain the very same day that Eliphalet Duncan met Kitty Sutton in
front of the railing of Grace Church. The ghostly bride and bridegroom
went away at once on their bridal tour, and Lord and Lady Duncan went
down to the little old house at Salem to pass their honeymoon."

Uncle Larry stopped. His tiny cigar was out again. The tale of the rival
ghosts was told. A solemn silence fell on the little party on the deck
of the ocean steamer, broken harshly by the hoarse roar of the
fog-horn.




THE DAMNED THING

BY AMBROSE BIERCE


I

ONE DOES NOT ALWAYS EAT WHAT IS ON THE TABLE

By the light of a tallow candle which had been placed on one end of a
rough table a man was reading something written in a book. It was an old
account book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently, very
legible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of the
candle to get a stronger light on it. The shadow of the book would then
throw into obscurity a half of the room, darkening a number of faces and
figures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present. Seven of
them sat against the rough log walls, silent, motionless, and the room
being small, not very far from the table. By extending an arm any one of
them could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the table, face
upward, partly covered by a sheet, his arms at his sides. He was dead.

The man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all
seemed to be waiting for something to occur; the dead man only was
without expectation. From the blank darkness outside came in, through
the aperture that served for a window, all the ever unfamiliar noises of
night in the wilderness--the long nameless note of a distant coyote; the
stilly pulsing thrill of tireless insects in trees; strange cries of
night birds, so different from those of the birds of day; the drone of
great blundering beetles, and all that mysterious chorus of small sounds
that seem always to have been but half heard when they have suddenly
ceased, as if conscious of an indiscretion. But nothing of all this was
noted in that company; its members were not overmuch addicted to idle
interest in matters of no practical importance; that was obvious in
every line of their rugged faces--obvious even in the dim light of the
single candle. They were evidently men of the vicinity--farmers and
woodsmen.

The person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him
that he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his attire
which attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his
environment. His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco;
his foot-gear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on
the floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had
considered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have
missed its meaning. In countenance the man was rather prepossessing,
with just a hint of sternness; though that he may have assumed or
cultivated, as appropriate to one in authority. For he was a coroner. It
was by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which
he was reading; it had been found among the dead man's effects--in his
cabin, where the inquest was now taking place.

When the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast
pocket. At that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered.
He, clearly, was not of mountain birth and breeding: he was clad as
those who dwell in cities. His clothing was dusty, however, as from
travel. He had, in fact, been riding hard to attend the inquest.

The coroner nodded; no one else greeted him.

"We have waited for you," said the coroner. "It is necessary to have
done with this business to-night."

The young man smiled. "I am sorry to have kept you," he said. "I went
away, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account
of what I suppose I am called back to relate."

The coroner smiled.

"The account that you posted to your newspaper," he said, "differs,
probably, from that which you will give here under oath."

"That," replied the other, rather hotly and with a visible flush, "is as
you please. I used manifold paper and have a copy of what I sent. It
was not written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction. It may go
as a part of my testimony under oath."

"But you say it is incredible."

"That is nothing to you, sir, if I also swear that it is true."

The coroner was silent for a time, his eyes upon the floor. The men
about the sides of the cabin talked in whispers, but seldom withdrew
their gaze from the face of the corpse. Presently the coroner lifted his
eyes and said: "We will resume the inquest."

The men removed their hats. The witness was sworn.

"What is your name?" the coroner asked.

"William Harker."

"Age?"

"Twenty-seven."

"You knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?"

"Yes."

"You were with him when he died?"

"Near him."

"How did that happen--your presence, I mean?"

"I was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish. A part of my
purpose, however, was to study him and his odd, solitary way of life. He
seemed a good model for a character in fiction. I sometimes write
stories."

"I sometimes read them."

"Thank you."

"Stories in general--not yours."

Some of the jurors laughed. Against a somber background humor shows high
lights. Soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily, and a jest in
the death chamber conquers by surprise.

"Relate the circumstances of this man's death," said the coroner. "You
may use any notes or memoranda that you please."

The witness understood. Pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket he
held it near the candle and turning the leaves until he found the
passage that he wanted began to read.


II

WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN A FIELD OF WILD OATS

". . . The sun had hardly risen when we left the house. We were looking
for quail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog. Morgan said
that our best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out, and
we crossed it by a trail through the _chaparral_. On the other side was
comparatively level ground, thickly covered with wild oats. As we
emerged from the _chaparral_ Morgan was but a few yards in advance.
Suddenly we heard, at a little distance to our right and partly in
front, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we
could see were violently agitated.

"'We've started a deer,' I said. 'I wish we had brought a rifle.'

"Morgan, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated
_chaparral_, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of his gun and
was holding it in readiness to aim. I thought him a trifle excited,
which surprised me, for he had a reputation for exceptional coolness,
even in moments of sudden and imminent peril.

"'O, come,' I said. 'You are not going to fill up a deer with
quail-shot, are you?'

"Still he did not reply; but catching a sight of his face as he turned
it slightly toward me I was struck by the intensity of his look. Then I
understood that we had serious business in hand and my first conjecture
was that we had 'jumped' a grizzly. I advanced to Morgan's side, cocking
my piece as I moved.

"The bushes were now quiet and the sounds had ceased, but Morgan was as
attentive to the place as before.

"'What is it? What the devil is it?' I asked.

"'That Damned Thing!' he replied, without turning his head. His voice
was husky and unnatural. He trembled visibly.

"I was about to speak further, when I observed the wild oats near the
place of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way. I can
hardly describe it. It seemed as if stirred by a streak of wind, which
not only bent it, but pressed it down--crushed it so that it did not
rise; and this movement was slowly prolonging itself directly toward us.

"Nothing that I had ever seen had affected me so strangely as this
unfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon, yet I am unable to recall any
sense of fear. I remember--and tell it here because, singularly enough,
I recollected it then--that once in looking carelessly out of an open
window I momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a
group of larger trees at a little distance away. It looked the same size
as the others, but being more distinctly and sharply defined in mass and
detail seemed out of harmony with them. It was a mere falsification of
the law of aerial perspective, but it startled, almost terrified me. We
so rely upon the orderly operation of familiar natural laws that any
seeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning
of unthinkable calamity. So now the apparently causeless movement of the
herbage and the slow, undeviating approach of the line of disturbances
were distinctly disquieting. My companion appeared actually frightened,
and I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his
gun to his shoulder and fire both barrels at the agitated grain! Before
the smoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage cry--a
scream like that of a wild animal--and flinging his gun upon the ground
Morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot. At the same instant I
was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something unseen in
the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown against me with
great force.

"Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to
have been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in
mortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse, savage
sounds as one hears from fighting dogs. Inexpressibly terrified, I
struggled to my feet and looked in the direction of Morgan's retreat;
and may Heaven in mercy spare me from another sight like that! At a
distance of less than thirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee,
his head thrown back at a frightful angle, hatless, his long hair in
disorder and his whole body in violent movement from side to side,
backward and forward. His right arm was lifted and seemed to lack the
hand--at least, I could see none. The other arm was invisible. At times,
as my memory now reports this extraordinary scene, I could discern but a
part of his body; it was as if he had been partly blotted out--I cannot
otherwise express it--then a shifting of his position would bring it all
into view again.

"All this must have occurred within a few seconds, yet in that time
Morgan assumed all the postures of a determined wrestler vanquished by
superior weight and strength. I saw nothing but him, and him not always
distinctly. During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard,
as if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I
had never heard from the throat of man or brute!

"For a moment only I stood irresolute, then throwing down my gun I ran
forward to my friend's assistance. I had a vague belief that he was
suffering from a fit, or some form of convulsion. Before I could reach
his side he was down and quiet. All sounds had ceased, but with a
feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired I now
saw again the mysterious movement of the wild oats, prolonging itself
from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of a
wood. It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to
withdraw my eyes and look at my companion. He was dead."


III

A MAN THOUGH NAKED MAY BE IN RAGS

The coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man. Lifting an
edge of the sheet he pulled it away, exposing the entire body,
altogether naked and showing in the candle-light a claylike yellow. It
had, however, broad maculations of bluish black, obviously caused by
extravasated blood from contusions. The chest and sides looked as if
they had been beaten with a bludgeon. There were dreadful lacerations;
the skin was torn in strips and shreds.

The coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk
handkerchief which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the top
of the head. When the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what had
been the throat. Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better view
repented their curiosity and turned away their faces. Witness Harker
went to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and sick.
Dropping the handkerchief upon the dead man's neck the coroner stepped
to an angle of the room and from a pile of clothing produced one garment
after another, each of which he held up a moment for inspection. All
were torn, and stiff with blood. The jurors did not make a closer
inspection. They seemed rather uninterested. They had, in truth, seen
all this before; the only thing that was new to them being Harker's
testimony.

"Gentlemen," the coroner said, "we have no more evidence, I think. Your
duty has been already explained to you; if there is nothing you wish to
ask you may go outside and consider your verdict."

The foreman rose--a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarsely clad.

"I should like to ask one question, Mr. Coroner," he said. "What asylum
did this yer last witness escape from?"

"Mr. Harker," said the coroner, gravely and tranquilly, "from what
asylum did you last escape?"

Harker flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven jurors
rose and solemnly filed out of the cabin.

"If you have done insulting me, sir," said Harker, as soon as he and the
officer were left alone with the dead man, "I suppose I am at liberty to
go?"

"Yes."

Harker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.
The habit of his profession was strong in him--stronger than his sense
of personal dignity. He turned about and said:

"The book that you have there--I recognize it as Morgan's diary. You
seemed greatly interested in it; you read in it while I was testifying.
May I see it? The public would like----"

"The book will cut no figure in this matter," replied the official,
slipping it into his coat pocket; "all the entries in it were made
before the writer's death."

As Harker passed out of the house the jury reÃ«ntered and stood about the
table, on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp
definition. The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced from
his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper and wrote rather
laboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort
all signed:

"We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands
of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits."


IV

AN EXPLANATION FROM THE TOMB

In the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries
having, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions. At the inquest upon
his body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought
it not worth while to confuse the jury. The date of the first of the
entries mentioned cannot be ascertained; the upper part of the leaf is
torn away; the part of the entry remaining follows:

". . . would run in a half-circle, keeping his head turned always toward
the center, and again he would stand still, barking furiously. At last
he ran away into the brush as fast as he could go. I thought at first
that he had gone mad, but on returning to the house found no other
alteration in his manner than what was obviously due to fear of
punishment.

"Can a dog see with his nose? Do odors impress some cerebral center with
images of the thing that emitted them? . . .

"Sept. 2.--Looking at the stars last night as they rose above the crest
of the ridge east of the house, I observed them successively
disappear--from left to right. Each was eclipsed but an instant, and
only a few at the same time, but along the entire length of the ridge
all that were within a degree or two of the crest were blotted out. It
was as if something had passed along between me and them; but I could
not see it, and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline.
Ugh! I don't like this." . . .

Several weeks' entries are missing, three leaves being torn from the
book.

"Sept. 27.--It has been about here again--I find evidences of its
presence every day. I watched again all last night in the same cover,
gun in hand, double-charged with buckshot. In the morning the fresh
footprints were there, as before. Yet I would have sworn that I did not
sleep--indeed, I hardly sleep at all. It is terrible, insupportable! If
these amazing experiences are real I shall go mad; if they are fanciful
I am mad already.

"Oct. 3.--I shall not go--it shall not drive me away. No, this is _my_
house, _my_ land. God hates a coward. . . .

"Oct. 5.--I can stand it no longer; I have invited Harker to pass a few
weeks with me--he has a level head. I can judge from his manner if he
thinks me mad.

"Oct. 7.--I have the solution of the mystery; it came to me last
night--suddenly, as by revelation. How simple--how terribly simple!

"There are sounds that we cannot hear. At either end of the scale are
notes that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument, the human ear.
They are too high or too grave. I have observed a flock of blackbirds
occupying an entire tree-top--the tops of several trees--and all in full
song. Suddenly--in a moment--at absolutely the same instant--all spring
into the air and fly away. How? They could not all see one
another--whole tree-tops intervened. At no point could a leader have
been visible to all. There must have been a signal of warning or
command, high and shrill above the din, but by me unheard. I have
observed, too, the same simultaneous flight when all were silent, among
not only blackbirds, but other birds--quail, for example, widely
separated by bushes--even on opposite sides of a hill.

"It is known to seamen that a school of whales basking or sporting on
the surface of the ocean, miles apart, with the convexity of the earth
between, will sometimes dive at the same instant--all gone out of sight
in a moment. The signal has been sounded--too grave for the ear of the
sailor at the masthead and his comrades on the deck--who nevertheless
feel its vibrations in the ship as the stones of a cathedral are stirred
by the bass of the organ.

"As with sounds, so with colors. At each end of the solar spectrum the
chemist can detect the presence of what are known as 'actinic' rays.
They represent colors--integral colors in the composition of
light--which we are unable to discern. The human eye is an imperfect
instrument; its range is but a few octaves of the real 'chromatic
scale.' I am not mad; there are colors that we cannot see.

"And, God help me! the Damned Thing is of such a color!"




THE INTERVAL[J]

BY VINCENT O'SULLIVAN

From _The Boston Evening Transcript_


Mrs. Wilton passed through a little alley leading from one of the gates
which are around Regent's Park, and came out on the wide and quiet
street. She walked along slowly, peering anxiously from side to side so
as not to overlook the number. She pulled her furs closer round her;
after her years in India this London damp seemed very harsh. Still, it
was not a fog to-day. A dense haze, gray and tinged ruddy, lay between
the houses, sometimes blowing with a little wet kiss against the face.
Mrs. Wilton's hair and eyelashes and her furs were powdered with tiny
drops. But there was nothing in the weather to blur the sight; she could
see the faces of people some distance off and read the signs on the
shops.

Before the door of a dealer in antiques and second-hand furniture she
paused and looked through the shabby uncleaned window at an unassorted
heap of things, many of them of great value. She read the Polish name
fastened on the pane in white letters.

"Yes; this is the place."

She opened the door, which met her entrance with an ill-tempered jangle.
From somewhere in the black depths of the shop the dealer came forward.
He had a clammy white face, with a sparse black beard, and wore a skull
cap and spectacles. Mrs. Wilton spoke to him in a low voice.

A look of complicity, of cunning, perhaps of irony, passed through the
dealer's cynical and sad eyes. But he bowed gravely and respectfully.

"Yes, she is here, madam. Whether she will see you or not I do not know.
She is not always well; she has her moods. And then, we have to be so
careful. The police--Not that they would touch a lady like you. But the
poor alien has not much chance these days."

Mrs. Wilton followed him to the back of the shop, where there was a
winding staircase. She knocked over a few things in her passage and
stooped to pick them up, but the dealer kept muttering, "It does not
matter--surely it does not matter." He lit a candle.

"You must go up these stairs. They are very dark; be careful. When you
come to a door, open it and go straight in."

He stood at the foot of the stairs holding the light high above his head
and she ascended.

The room was not very large, and it seemed very ordinary. There were
some flimsy, uncomfortable chairs in gilt and red. Two large palms were
in corners. Under a glass cover on the table was a view of Rome. The
room had not a business-like look, thought Mrs. Wilton; there was no
suggestion of the office or waiting-room where people came and went all
day; yet you would not say that it was a private room which was lived
in. There were no books or papers about; every chair was in the place it
had been placed when the room was last swept; there was no fire and it
was very cold.

To the right of the window was a door covered with a plush curtain. Mrs.
Wilton sat down near the table and watched this door. She thought it
must be through it that the soothsayer would come forth. She laid her
hands listlessly one on top of the other on the table. This must be the
tenth seer she had consulted since Hugh had been killed. She thought
them over. No, this must be the eleventh. She had forgotten that
frightening man in Paris who said he had been a priest. Yet of them all
it was only he who had told her anything definite. But even he could do
no more than tell the past. He told of her marriage; he even had the
duration of it right--twenty-one months. He told too of their time in
India--at least, he knew that her husband had been a soldier, and said
he had been on service in the "colonies." On the whole, though, he had
been as unsatisfactory as the others. None of them had given her the
consolation she sought. She did not want to be told of the past. If Hugh
was gone forever, then with him had gone all her love of living, her
courage, all her better self. She wanted to be lifted out of the
despair, the dazed aimless drifting from day to day, longing at night
for the morning, and in the morning for the fall of night, which had
been her life since his death. If somebody could assure her that it was
not all over, that he was somewhere, not too far away, unchanged from
what he had been here, with his crisp hair and rather slow smile and
lean brown face, that he saw her sometimes, that he had not forgotten
her. . . .

"Oh, Hugh, darling!"

When she looked up again the woman was sitting there before her. Mrs.
Wilton had not heard her come in. With her experience, wide enough now,
of seers and fortune-tellers of all kinds, she saw at once that this
woman was different from the others. She was used to the quick
appraising look, the attempts, sometimes clumsy, but often cleverly
disguised, to collect some fragments of information whereupon to erect a
plausible vision. But this woman looked as if she took it out of
herself.

Not that her appearance suggested intercourse with the spiritual world
more than the others had done; it suggested that, in fact, considerably
less. Some of the others were frail, yearning, evaporated creatures, and
the ex-priest in Paris had something terrible and condemned in his look.
He might well sup with the devil, that man, and probably did in some way
or other.

But this was a little fat, weary-faced woman about fifty, who only did
not look like a cook because she looked more like a sempstress. Her
black dress was all covered with white threads. Mrs. Wilton looked at
her with some embarrassment. It seemed more reasonable to be asking a
woman like this about altering a gown than about intercourse with the
dead. That seemed even absurd in such a very commonplace presence. The
woman seemed timid and oppressed: she breathed heavily and kept rubbing
her dingy hands, which looked moist, one over the other; she was always
wetting her lips, and coughed with a little dry cough. But in her these
signs of nervous exhaustion suggested overwork in a close atmosphere,
bending too close over the sewing-machine. Her uninteresting hair, like
a rat's pelt, was eked out with a false addition of another color. Some
threads had got into her hair too.

Her harried, uneasy look caused Mrs. Wilton to ask compassionately: "Are
you much worried by the police?"

"Oh, the police! Why don't they leave us alone? You never know who comes
to see you. Why don't they leave me alone? I'm a good woman. I only
think. What I do is no harm to any one." . . .

She continued in an uneven querulous voice, always rubbing her hands
together nervously. She seemed to the visitor to be talking at random,
just gabbling, like children do sometimes before they fall asleep.

"I wanted to explain----" hesitated Mrs. Wilton.

But the woman, with her head pressed close against the back of the
chair, was staring beyond her at the wall. Her face had lost whatever
little expression it had; it was blank and stupid. When she spoke it was
very slowly and her voice was guttural.

"Can't you see him? It seems strange to me that you can't see him. He is
so near you. He is passing his arm round your shoulders."

This was a frequent gesture of Hugh's. And indeed at that moment she
felt that somebody was very near her, bending over her. She was
enveloped in tenderness. Only a very thin veil, she felt, prevented her
from seeing. But the woman saw. She was describing Hugh minutely, even
the little things like the burn on his right hand.

"Is he happy? Oh, ask him does he love me?"

The result was so far beyond anything she had hoped for that she was
stunned. She could only stammer the first thing that came into her head.
"Does he love me?"

"He loves you. He won't answer, but he loves you. He wants me to make
you see him; he is disappointed, I think, because I can't. But I can't
unless you do it yourself."

After a while she said:

"I think you will see him again. You think of nothing else. He is very
close to us now."

Then she collapsed, and fell into a heavy sleep and lay there
motionless, hardly breathing. Mrs. Wilton put some notes on the table
and stole out on tip-toe.

       *       *       *       *       *

She seemed to remember that downstairs in the dark shop the dealer with
the waxen face detained her to show some old silver and jewelry and such
like. But she did not come to herself, she had no precise recollection
of anything, till she found herself entering a church near Portland
Place. It was an unlikely act in her normal moments. Why did she go in
there? She acted like one walking in her sleep.

The church was old and dim, with high black pews. There was nobody
there. Mrs. Wilton sat down in one of the pews and bent forward with her
face in her hands.

After a few minutes she saw that a soldier had come in noiselessly and
placed himself about half-a-dozen rows ahead of her. He never turned
round; but presently she was struck by something familiar in the figure.
First she thought vaguely that the soldier looked like her Hugh. Then,
when he put up his hand, she saw who it was.

She hurried out of the pew and ran towards him. "Oh, Hugh, Hugh, have
you come back?"

He looked round with a smile. He had not been killed. It was all a
mistake. He was going to speak. . . .

Footsteps sounded hollow in the empty church. She turned and glanced
down the dim aisle.

It was an old sexton or verger who approached. "I thought I heard you
call," he said.

"I was speaking to my husband." But Hugh was nowhere to be seen.

"He was here a moment ago." She looked about in anguish. "He must have
gone to the door."

"There's nobody here," said the old man gently. "Only you and me. Ladies
are often taken funny since the war. There was one in here yesterday
afternoon said she was married in this church and her husband had
promised to meet her here. Perhaps you were married here?"

"No," said Mrs. Wilton, desolately. "I was married in India."

       *       *       *       *       *

It might have been two or three days after that, when she went into a
small Italian restaurant in the Bayswater district. She often went out
for her meals now: she had developed an exhausting cough, and she found
that it somehow became less troublesome when she was in a public place
looking at strange faces. In her flat there were all the things that
Hugh had used; the trunks and bags still had his name on them with the
labels of places where they had been together. They were like stabs. In
the restaurant, people came and went, many soldiers too among them, just
glancing at her in her corner.

This day, as it chanced, she was rather late and there was nobody there.
She was very tired. She nibbled at the food they brought her. She could
almost have cried from tiredness and loneliness and the ache in her
heart.

Then suddenly he was before her, sitting there opposite at the table. It
was as it was in the days of their engagement, when they used sometimes
to lunch at restaurants. He was not in uniform. He smiled at her and
urged her to eat, just as he used in those days. . . .

I met her that afternoon as she was crossing Kensington Gardens, and she
told me about it.

"I have been with Hugh." She seemed most happy.

"Did he say anything?"

"N-no. Yes. I think he did, but I could not quite hear. My head was so
very tired. The next time----"

       *       *       *       *       *

I did not see her for some time after that. She found, I think, that by
going to places where she had once seen him--the old church, the little
restaurant--she was more certain to see him again. She never saw him at
home. But in the street or the park he would often walk along beside
her. Once he saved her from being run over. She said she actually felt
his hand grabbing her arm, suddenly, when the car was nearly upon her.

She had given me the address of the clairvoyant; and it is through that
strange woman that I know--or seem to know--what followed.

Mrs. Wilton was not exactly ill last winter, not so ill, at least, as to
keep to her bedroom. But she was very thin, and her great handsome eyes
always seemed to be staring at some point beyond, searching. There was a
look in them that seamen's eyes sometimes have when they are drawing on
a coast of which they are not very certain. She lived almost in
solitude: she hardly ever saw anybody except when they sought her out.
To those who were anxious about her she laughed and said she was very
well.

One sunny morning she was lying awake, waiting for the maid to bring her
tea. The shy London sunlight peeped through the blinds. The room had a
fresh and happy look.

When she heard the door open she thought that the maid had come in. Then
she saw that Hugh was standing at the foot of the bed. He was in uniform
this time, and looked as he had looked the day he went away.

"Oh, Hugh, speak to me! Will you not say just one word?"

He smiled and threw back his head, just as he used to in the old days at
her mother's house when he wanted to call her out of the room without
attracting the attention of the others. He moved towards the door, still
signing to her to follow him. He picked up her slippers on his way and
held them out to her as if he wanted her to put them on. She slipped out
of bed hastily. . . .

       *       *       *       *       *

It is strange that when they came to look through her things after her
death the slippers could never be found.

"DEY AIN'T NO GHOSTS"[K]

BY ELLIS PARKER BUTLER


Once 'pon a time dey was a li'l' black boy whut he name was Mose. An'
whin he come erlong to be 'bout knee-high to a mewel, he 'gin to git
powerful 'fraid ob ghosts, 'ca'se dat am sure a mighty ghostly location
whut he lib' in, 'ca'se dey's a grabeyard in de hollow, an' a
buryin'-ground on de hill, an' a cemuntary in betwixt an' between, an'
dey ain't nuffin' but trees nowhar excipt in de clearin' by de shanty
an' down de hollow whar de pumpkin-patch am.

An' whin de night come' erlong, dey ain't no sounds _at_ all whut kin be
heard in dat locality but de rain-doves, whut mourn out,
"Oo-_oo_-o-o-o!" jes dat trembulous _an'_ scary, an' de owls, whut mourn
out, "Whut-_whoo_-o-o-o!" more trembulous an' scary dan dat, an' de
wind, whut mourn out, "You-_you_-o-o-o!" mos' scandalous' trembulous an'
scary ob all. Dat a powerful onpleasant locality for a li'l' black boy
whut he name was Mose.

'Ca'se dat li'l' black boy he so specially black he can't be seen in de
dark _at_ all 'cept by de whites ob he eyes. So whin he go' outen de
house _at_ night, he ain't dast shut he eyes, 'ca'se den ain't nobody
can see him in de least. He jest as invidsible as nuffin'. An' who know'
but whut a great, big ghost bump right into him 'ca'se it can't see him?
An' dat shore w'u'd scare dat li'l' black boy powerful' bad, 'ca'se
yever'body knows whut a cold, damp pussonality a ghost is.

So whin dat li'l' black Mose go' outen de shanty at night, he keep' he
eyes wide open, you may be shore. By day he eyes 'bout de size ob
butter-pats, an' come sundown he eyes 'bout de size ob saucers; but whin
he go' outen de shanty at night, he eyes am de size ob de white chiny
plate whut set on de mantel; an' it powerful' hard to keep eyes whut am
de size ob dat from a-winkin' an' a-blinkin'.

So whin Hallowe'en come erlong, dat lil' black Mose he jes mek' up he
mind he ain't gwine outen he shack _at_ all. He cogitate' he gwine stay
right snug in de shack wid he pa an' he ma, 'ca'se de rain-doves tek
notice dat de ghosts are philanderin' roun' de country, 'ca'se dey mourn
out, "Oo-_oo_-o-o-o!" an' de owls dey mourn out, "Whut-_whoo_-o-o-o!"
and de wind mourn out, "You-_you_-o-o-o!" De eyes ob dat li'l' black
Mose dey as big as de white chiny plate whut set on de mantel by side de
clock, an' de sun jes a-settin'.

So dat all right. Li'l' black Mose he scrooge' back in de corner by de
fireplace, an' he 'low' he gwine stay dere till he gwine _to_ bed. But
byme-by Sally Ann, whut live' up de road, draps in, an' Mistah Sally
Ann, whut is her husban', he draps in, an' Zack Badget an' de
school-teacher whut board' at Unc' Silas Diggs's house drap in, an' a
powerful lot ob folks drap in. An' li'l' black Mose he seen dat gwine be
one s'prise-party, an' he right down cheerful 'bout dat.

So all dem folks shake dere hands an' 'low "Howdy," an' some ob dem say:
"Why, dere 's li'l Mose! Howdy, li'l' Mose?" An' he so please' he jes
grin' an' grin', 'ca'se he aint reckon whut gwine happen. So byme-by
Sally Ann, whut live up de road, she say', "Ain't no sort o' Hallowe'en
lest we got a jack-o'-lantern." An' de school-teacher, whut board at
Unc' Silas Diggs's house, she 'low', "Hallowe'en jes no Hallowe'en _at_
all 'thout we got a jack-o'-lantern." An' li'l' black Mose he stop'
a-grinnin', an' he scrooge' so far back in de corner he 'mos' scrooge
frough de wall. But dat ain't no use, 'ca'se he ma say', "Mose, go on
down to de pumpkin-patch an' fotch a pumpkin."

"I ain't want to go," say' li'l' black Mose.

"Go on erlong wid yo'," say' he ma, right commandin'.

"I ain't want to go," say' Mose ag'in.

"Why ain't yo' want to go?" he ma ask'.

"'Case I 's afraid ob de ghosts," say' li'l' black Mose, an' dat de
particular truth an' no mistake.

"Dey ain't no ghosts," say' de school-teacher, whut board at Unc' Silas
Diggs's house, right peart.

"'Co'se dey ain't no ghosts," say' Zack Badget, whut dat 'fear'd ob
ghosts he ain't dar' come to li'l' black Mose's house ef de
school-teacher ain't ercompany him.

"Go 'long wid your ghosts!" say' li'l' black Mose's ma.

"What' yo' pick up dat nomsense?" say' he pa. "Dey ain't no ghosts."

An' dat whut all dat s'prise-party 'low: dey ain't no ghosts. An' dey
'low dey mus' hab a jack-o'-lantern or de fun all sp'iled. So dat li'l'
black boy whut he name is Mose he done got to fotch a pumpkin from de
pumpkin-patch down de hollow. So he step' outen de shanty an' he stan'
on de door-step twell he get' he eyes pried open as big as de bottom ob
he ma's wash-tub, mostly, an' he say', "Dey ain't no ghosts." An' he
put' one foot on de ground, an' dat was de fust step.

An' de rain-dove say', "Oo-_oo_-o-o-o!"

An' li'l' black Mose he tuck anudder step.

An' de owl mourn' out, "Whut-_whoo_-o-o-o!"

An' li'l' black Mose he tuck anudder step.

An' de wind sob' out, "You-_you_-o-o-o!"

An' li'l' black Mose he tuck one look ober he shoulder, an' he shut he
eyes so tight dey hurt round de aidges, an' he pick' up he foots an'
run. Yas, sah, he run' right peart fast. An' he say': "Dey ain't no
ghosts. Dey ain't no ghosts." An' he run' erlong de paff whut lead' by
de buryin'-ground on de hill, 'ca'se dey ain't no fince eround dat
buryin'-ground _at_ all.

No fince; jes de big trees whut de owls an' de rain-doves sot in an'
mourn an' sob, an' whut de wind sigh an' cry frough. An' byme-by
somefin' jes _brush'_ li'l' Mose on de arm, which mek' him run jes a bit
more faster. An' byme-by somefin' jes _brush'_ li'l' Mose on de cheek,
which mek' him run erbout as fast as he can. An' byme-by somefin'
_grab'_ li'l' Mose by de aidge of he coat, an' he fight' an' struggle'
an' cry' out: "Dey ain't no ghosts. Dey ain't no ghosts." An' dat ain't
nuffin' but de wild brier whut grab' him, an' dat ain't nuffin' but de
leaf ob a tree whut brush' he cheek, an' dat ain't nuffin' but de branch
ob a hazel-bush whut brush he arm. But he downright scared jes de same,
an' he ain't lose no time, 'ca'se de wind an' de owls an' de rain-doves
dey signerfy whut ain't no good. So he scoot' past dat buryin'-ground
whut on de hill, an' dat cemuntary whut betwixt an' between, an' dat
grabeyard in de hollow, twell he come' to de pumpkin-patch, an' he
rotch' down an' tek' erhold ob de bestest pumpkin whut in de patch. An'
he right smart scared. He jes de mostest scared li'l' black boy whut
yever was. He ain't gwine open he eyes fo' nuffin', 'ca'se de wind go,
"You-_you_-o-o-o!" an' de owls go, "Whut-_whoo_-o-o-o!" an' de
rain-doves go, "Oo-_oo_-o-o-o!"

He jes speculate', "Dey ain't no ghosts," an' wish' he hair don't stand
on ind dat way. An' he jes cogitate', "Dey ain't no ghosts," an' wish'
he goose-pimples don't rise up dat way. An' he jes 'low', "Dey ain't no
ghosts," an' wish' he backbone ain't all trembulous wid chills dat way.
So he rotch' down, an' he rotch' down, twell he git' a good hold on dat
pricklesome stem of dat bestest pumpkin whut in de patch, an' he jes
yank' dat stem wid all he might.

"_Let loosen my head!_" say' a big voice all on a suddent.

Dat li'l' black boy whut he name is Mose he jump' 'most outen he skin.
He open' he eyes, an' he 'gin' to shake like de aspen-tree, 'ca'se whut
dat a-standin' right dar behint him but a 'mendjous big ghost! Yas, sah,
dat de bigges', whites' ghost whut yever was. An' it ain't got no head.
Ain't got no head _at_ all! Li'l' black Mose he jes drap' on he knees
an' he beg' an' pray':

"Oh, 'scuse me! 'Scuse me, Mistah Ghost!" he beg'. "Ah ain't mean no
harm _at_ all."

"Whut for you try to take my head?" ask' de ghost in dat fearsome voice
whut like de damp wind outen de cellar.

"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!" beg' li'l' Mose. "Ah ain't know dat was yo'
head, an' I ain't know you was dar _at_ all. 'Scuse me!"

"Ah 'scuse you ef you do me dis favor," say' de ghost. "Ah got somefin'
powerful _im_portant to say unto you, an' Ah can't say hit 'ca'se Ah
ain't got no head; an' whin Ah ain't got no head, Ah ain't got no mouf,
an' whin Ah ain't got no mouf, Ah can't talk _at_ all."

An' dat right logical fo' shore. Can't nobody talk whin he ain't got no
mouf, an' can't nobody have no mouf whin he ain't got no head, an' whin
li'l' black Mose he look', he see' dat ghost ain't got no head _at_ all.
Nary head.

So de ghost say':

"Ah come on down yere fo' to git a pumpkin fo' a head, an' Ah pick' dat
_ix_act pumpkin whut yo' gwine tek, an' Ah don't like dat one bit. No,
sah. Ah feel like Ah pick yo' up an' carry yo' away, an' nobody see you
no more for yever. But Ah got somefin' powerful _im_portant to say unto
yo', an' if yo' pick up dat pumpkin an' sot in on de place whar my head
ought to be, Ah let you off dis time, 'ca'se Ah ain't been able to talk
fo' so long Ah right hongry to say somefin'."

So li'l' black Mose he heft up dat pumpkin, an' de ghost he bend' down,
an' li'l' black Mose he sot dat pumpkin on dat ghostses neck. An' right
off dat pumpkin head 'gin' to wink an' blink like a jack-o'-lantern, an'
right off dat pumpkin head 'gin' to glimmer an' glow frough de mouf like
a jack-o'-lantern, an' right off dat ghost start' to speak. Yas, sah,
dass so.

"Whut yo' want to say unto me?" _in_quire' li'l' black Mose.

"Ah want to tell yo'," say' de ghost, "dat yo' ain't need yever be
skeered of ghosts, 'ca'se dey ain't no ghosts."

An' whin he say dat, de ghost jes vanish' away like de smoke in July. He
ain't even linger round dat locality like de smoke in Yoctober. He jes
dissipate' outen de air, an' he gone _in_tirely.

So li'l' Mose he grab' up de nex' bestest pumpkin an' he scoot'. An'
whin he come' to be grabeyard in de hollow, he goin' erlong same as
yever, on'y faster, whin he reckon' he 'll pick up a club _in_ case he
gwine have trouble. An' he rotch' down an' rotch' down an' tek' hold of
a likely appearin' hunk o' wood whut right dar. An' whin he grab' dat
hunk of wood----

"_Let loosen my leg!_" say' a big voice all on a suddent.

Dat li'l' black boy 'most jump' outen he skin, 'ca'se right dar in de
paff is six 'mendjus big ghostes, an' de bigges' ain't got but one leg.
So li'l' black Mose jes natchully handed dat hunk of wood to dat
bigges' ghost, an' he say':

"'Scuse me, Mistah Ghost; Ah ain't know dis your leg."

An' whut dem six ghostes do but stand round an' confabulate? Yas, sah,
dass so. An' whin dey do so, one say':

"'Pears like dis a mighty likely li'l' black boy. Whut we gwine do fo'
to _re_ward him fo' politeness?"

An' anudder say':

"Tell him whut de truth is 'bout ghostes."

So de bigges' ghost he say':

"Ah gwine tell yo' somefin' _im_portant whut yever'body don't know: Dey
_ain't_ no ghosts."

An' whin he say' dat, de ghostes jes natchully vanish away, an' li'l'
black Mose he proceed' up de paff. He so scared he hair jes yank' at de
roots, an' whin de wind go', "Oo-_oo_-o-o-o!" an' de owl go',
"Whut-_whoo_-o-o-o!" an' de rain-doves go, "You-_you_-o-o-o!" he jes
tremble' an' shake'. An' byme-by he come' to de cemuntary whut betwixt
an' between, an' he shore is mighty skeered, 'ca'se dey is a whole
comp'ny of ghostes lined up along de road, an' he 'low' he ain't gwine
spind no more time palaverin' wid ghostes. So he step' often de road fo'
to go round erbout, an' he step' on a pine-stump whut lay right dar.

"_Git offen my chest!_" say' a big voice all on a suddent, 'ca'se dat
stump am been selected by de captain ob de ghostes for to be he chest,
'ca'se he ain't got no chest betwixt he shoulders an' he legs. An' li'l'
black Mose he hop' offen dat stump right peart. Yes, _sah_; right peart.

"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!" dat li'l' black Mose beg' an' plead, an' de
ghostes ain't know whuther to eat him all up or not, 'ca'se he step' on
de boss ghostes's chest dat a-way. But byme-by they 'low they let him go
'ca'se dat was an accident, an' de captain ghost he say', "Mose, you
Mose, Ah gwine let you off dis time, 'ca'se you ain't nuffin' but a
misabul li'l' tremblin' nigger; but Ah want you should _re_mimimber one
thing mos' particular'."

"Ya-yas, sah," say' dat li'l' black boy; "Ah'll remimber. Whut is dat Ah
got to remimber?"

De captain ghost he swell' up, an' he swell' up, twell he as big as a
house, an' he say' in a voice whut shake' de ground:

"Dey ain't no ghosts."

So li'l' black Mose he bound to remimber dat, an' he rise' up an' mek' a
bow, an' he proceed' toward home right libely. He do, indeed.

An' he gwine along jes as fast as he kin' whin he come' to de aidge ob
de buryin'-ground whut on de hill, an' right dar he bound to stop,
'ca'se de kentry round about am so populate' he ain't able to go frough.
Yas, sah, seem' like all de ghostes in de world habin' a conferince
right dar. Seem' like all de ghosteses whut yever was am havin' a
convintion on dat spot. An' dat li'l' black Mose so skeered he jes fall'
down on a' old log whut dar an' screech' an' moan'. An' all on a suddent
de log up and spoke to li'l' Mose:

"_Get offen me! Get offen me!_" yell' dat log.

So li'l' black Mose he git' offen dat log, an' no mistake.

An' soon as he git' offen de log, de log uprise, an' li'l' black Mose he
see' dat dat log am de king ob all de ghostes. An' whin de king uprise,
all de congregation crowd round li'l' black Mose, an' dey am about leben
millium an' a few lift over. Yes, sah; dat de reg'lar annyul Hallowe'en
convintion whut li'l' black Mose interrup'. Right dar am all de sperits
in de world, an' all de ha'nts in de world, an' all de hobgoblins in de
world, an' all de ghouls in de world, an' all de spicters in de world,
an' all de ghostes in de world. An' whin dey see li'l' black Mose, dey
all gnash dey teef an' grin' 'ca'se it gettin' erlong toward dey-all's
lunch-time. So de king, whut he name old Skull-an'-Bones, he step' on
top ob li'l' Mose's head, an' he say':

"Gin'l'min, de convintion will come to order. De sicretary please note
who is prisint. De firs' business whut come' before de convintion am:
whut we gwine do to a li'l' black boy whut stip' on de king an' maul'
all ober de king an' treat' de king dat disrespictful'."

An' li'l' black Mose jes moan' an' sob':

"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me, Mistah King! Ah ain't mean no harm _at_ all."

But nobody ain't pay no _at_tintion to him _at_ all, 'ca'se yevery one
lookin' at a monstrous big ha'nt whut name Bloody Bones, whut rose up
an' spoke.

"Your Honor, Mistah King, an' gin'l'min _an'_ ladies," he say', "dis am
a right bad case ob _lazy majesty_, 'ca'se de king been step on. Whin
yivery li'l' black boy whut choose' gwine wander round _at_ night an'
stip on de king ob ghostes, it ain't no time for to palaver, it ain't no
time for to prevaricate, it ain't no time for to cogitate, it ain't no
time do nuffin' but tell de truth, an' de whole truth, an' nuffin' but
de truth."

An' all dem ghostes sicond de motion, an' dey confabulate out loud
erbout dat, an' de noise soun' like de rain-doves goin',
"Oo-_oo_-o-o-o!" an' de owls goin', "Whut-_whoo_-o-o-o!" an' de wind
goin', "You-_you_-o-o-o!" So dat risolution am passed unanermous, an' no
mistake.

So de king ob de ghostes, whut name old Skull-an'-Bones, he place' he
hand on de head ob li'l' black Mose, an' he hand feel like a wet rag,
an' he say':

"Dey ain't no ghosts."

An' one ob de hairs whut on de head ob li'l' black Mose turn' white.

An' de monstrous big ha'nt whut he name Bloody Bones he lay he hand on

"Dey ain't no ghosts."

An' anudder ob de hairs whut on de head ob li'l' black Mose turn' white.

An' a heejus sperit whut he name Moldy Pa'm place' he hand on de head ob

he say':

"Dey ain't no ghosts."

An' anudder ob de hairs whut on de head ob li'l' black Mose turn' white
_as_ snow.

An' a perticklar bend-up hobgoblin he put' he hand on de head ob li'l'
black Mose, an' he mek' dat same _re_mark, an' dat whole convintion ob

yivery hair whut on li'l' black Mose's head turn' white. Dat whut

Dat's so he ain' gwine forgit to remimber dey ain't no ghostes. 'Ca'se
ef a li'l' black boy gwine imaginate dey _is_ ghostes, he gwine be
skeered in de dark. An' dat a foolish thing for to imaginate.

So prisintly all de ghostes am whiff away, like de fog outen de holler
whin de wind blow' on it, an' li'l' black Mose he ain' see no ca'se for
to remain in dat locality no longer. He rotch' down, an' he raise' up de

"Yere's de pumpkin."

An' he ma an' he pa, an' Sally Ann, whut live up de road, an' Mistah

"Whut you all skeered fo'?"

'Ca'se ef anybody skeered, he want' to be skeered, too. Dat 's natural.
But de school-teacher, whut live at Unc' Silas Diggs's house, she say':

"Fo' de lan's sake, we fought you was a ghost!"

So li'l' black Mose he sort ob sniff an' he sort ob sneer, an' he 'low':

"Huh! dey ain't no ghosts."

Den he ma she powerful took back dat li'l' black Mose he gwine be so
uppetish an' contrydict folks whut know 'rifmeticks an' algebricks an'

"Huh! whut you know 'bout ghosts, anner ways?"

An' li'l' black Mose he jes kinder stan' on one foot, an' he jes kinder

"I don' know nuffin' erbout ghosts, 'ca'se dey ain't no ghosts."

So he pa gwine whop him fo' tellin' a fib 'bout dey ain' no ghosts whin
yiver'body know' dey is ghosts; but de school-teacher, whut board at
Unc' Silas Diggs's house, she tek' note de hair ob li'l' black Mose's

color ob wood-ash, so she jes retch' one arm round dat li'l' black boy,
an' she jes snuggle' him up, an' she say':

"Honey lamb, don't you be skeered; ain' nobody gwine hurt you. How you
know dey ain't no ghosts?"

An' li'l' black Mose he kinder lean' up 'g'inst de school-teacher whut
board at Unc' Silas Diggs's house, an' he 'low':

"'Ca'se--'ca'se--'ca'se I met de cap'n ghost, an' I met de gin'ral
ghost, an' I met de king ghost, an' I met all de ghostes whut yiver was
in de whole worl', an' yivery ghost say' de same thing: 'Dey ain't no

an' all de ghostes in de whole worl' don' know ef dar am ghostes, who
does?"

"Das right; das right, honey lamb," say' de school-teacher. And she
say': "I been s'picious dey ain' no ghostes dis long whiles, an' now I
know. Ef all de ghostes say dey ain' no ghosts, dey _ain'_ no ghosts."

So yiver'body 'low' dat so 'cep' Zack Badget, whut been tellin' de

'ca'se he right sweet on de school-teacher; but he know right well he

say' to li'l' black Mose:

"'Tain' likely you met up wid a monstrous big ha'nt whut live' down de

"Yas," say' li'l' black Mose, "I done met up wid him."

"An' did old Bloody Bones done tol' you dey ain' no ghosts?" say Zack
Badget.

"Yas," say' li'l' black Mose, "he done tell me perzackly dat."

"Well, if _he_ tol' you dey ain't no ghosts," say' Zack Badget, "I got
to 'low dey ain't no ghosts, 'ca'se he ain' gwine tell no lie erbout it.
I know dat Bloody Bones ghost sence I was a piccaninny, an' I done met
up wif him a powerful lot o' times, an' he ain' gwine tell no lie erbout
it. Ef dat perticklar ghost say' dey ain't no ghosts, dey _ain't_ no
ghosts."

So yiver-body say':

"Das right; dey ain't no ghosts."

An' dat mek' li'l' black Mose feel mighty good, 'ca'se he ain' lak
ghostes. He reckon' he gwine be a heap mo' comfortable in he mind sence
he know' dey ain' no ghosts, an' he reckon' he ain' gwine be skeered of
nuffin' never no more. He ain' gwine min' de dark, an' he ain' gwine

sence he know' fo' sure dey ain' no ghosts. So prisintly he ma say':

"Well, time fo' a li'l' black boy whut he name is Mose to be gwine up de

An' li'l' black Mose he 'low' he gwine wait a bit. He 'low' he gwine jes

So he ma she say':

"Git erlong wid yo'! Whut yo' skeered ob whin dey ain't no ghosts?"

An' li'l' black Mose he scrooge', and he twist', an' he pucker' up he

"I ain' skeered ob ghosts whut am, 'ca'se dey ain' no ghosts."

"Den whut _am_ yo' skeered ob?" ask he ma.

"Nuffin'," say' de li'l' black boy whut he name is Mose; "but I jes feel
kinder oneasy 'bout de ghosts whut ain't."

Jes lak white folks! Jes lak white folks!

SOME REAL AMERICAN GHOSTS

THE GIANT GHOST

(Philadelphia _Press_, Sept. 13, 1896)


A case in point is the Benton, Indiana, ghost, which is attracting much
attention. It has been seen and investigated by many people with
reputations for intelligence and good sense, but so far no explanation
of the strange appearance has been found.

A farmer named John W. French and his wife were the first to see this
apparition. They live in the country near Benton, and were driving home
one night from a neighbor's. The road passed an old church, moss-covered
and surrounded by a graveyard, overgrown with shrubbery and filled with
the bones of hundreds who once tilled the soil in the locality. Ten
years ago an aged man who lived alone not far from the old church and
visited the graveyard almost daily to pray over the resting place of
some relative was foully murdered for the store of gold he was supposed
to have hidden about his hermit abode. The robbers and murderers escaped
justice, and the luckless graybeard was buried in the graveyard where he
spent so much time. Just as French and his wife drew within sight of the
white headstones in the churchyard the horses reared back on their
haunches and snorted in terror. French was alarmed, and suspecting
highwaymen had been scented by the horses, he reached for a shotgun
which lay in the bottom of the wagon for just such an emergency. But
before his hand touched it he was startled by a scream from his wife.
Clutching his arm she pointed straight ahead and gasped: "Look, John,
look!"

Far down the road, just beside the glimmering monuments of the old
graveyard, he saw an apparition. It was that of a man with a long white
beard sweeping over his breast. The figure appeared to be eight feet in
height and in one hand it carried a club, such as the brains of the old
man had been beaten out with ten years before. Slowly raising one arm
the ghost with a majestic sweep beckoned French to come ahead. He was
too startled to do anything except try to restrain the prancing horses,
which were straining at the harness in attempts to break away and run. A
cold sweat started out all over the body of the farmer as he realized
that he was at last looking at a ghost, and then the sound of his wife's
voice came to him begging him to return the way they had come and escape
the doom which seemed impending. French was still too much scared and
excited to control the horses, and as he gazed steadfastly at the
fearful white object in the road it slowly began to move toward the
wagon. The club was now raised to its shoulder, as a soldier carries a
rifle, and it seemed to move forward without touching the ground, like a
winged thing.

Then the farmer recovered his faculties and, whirling his team around,
he lashed the horses into a run and began the trip to the house of the
friend he had just left. When they arrived there both the man and his
wife were almost fainting from fright.

The next man to see the ghost was Milton Moon. He had the reputation for
being not only a man of intelligence but one without fear. His
experience was much the same as that of the Frenches and it brought
about several investigations by parties of citizens. In each case they
saw and were convinced of the actual presence of the ghost without being
able to discover any satisfactory explanation.


SOME FAMOUS GHOSTS OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL

(Philadelphia _Press_, Oct. 2, 1898)

The Capitol at Washington is probably the most thoroughly haunted
building in the world.

Not less than fifteen well-authenticated ghosts infest it, and some of
them are of a more than ordinarily alarming character.

What particularly inspires this last remark is the fact that the Demon
Cat is said to have made its appearance again, after many years of
absence. This is a truly horrific apparition, and no viewless specter
such as the invisible grimalkin that even now trips people up on the
stairs of the old mansion which President Madison and his wife, Dolly,
occupied, at the corner of Eighteenth Street and New York Avenue, after
the White House was burned by the British. That, indeed, is altogether
another story; but the feline spook of the Capitol possesses attributes
much more remarkable, inasmuch as it has the appearance of an ordinary
pussy when first seen, and presently swells up to the size of an
elephant before the eyes of the terrified observer.

The Demon Cat, in whose regard testimony of the utmost seeming
authenticity was put on record thirty-five years ago, has been missing
since 1862. One of the watchmen on duty in the building shot at it then,
and it disappeared. Since then, until now, nothing more has been heard
of it, though one or two of the older policemen of the Capitol force
still speak of the spectral animal in awed whispers.

Their work, when performed in the night, requires more than ordinary
nerve, inasmuch as the interior of the great structure is literally
alive with echoes and other suggestions of the supernatural. In the
daytime, when the place is full of people and the noises of busy life,
the professional guides make a point of showing persons how a whisper
uttered when standing on a certain marble block is distinctly audible at
another point quite a distance away, though unheard in the space
between.

A good many phenomena of this kind are observable in various parts of
the Capitol, and the extent to which they become augmented in
strangeness during the silence of the night may well be conceived. The
silence of any ordinary house is oppressive sometimes to the least
superstitious individual. There are unaccountable noises, and a weird
and eerie sort of feeling comes over him, distracting him perhaps from
the perusal of his book. He finds himself indulging in a vague sense of
alarm, though he cannot imagine any cause for it.

Such suggestions of the supernatural are magnified a thousand fold in
the Capitol, when the watchman pursues his lonely beat through the great
corridors whose immense spaces impress him with a sense of solitariness,
while the shadows thrown by his lantern gather into strange and menacing
forms.

One of the most curious and alarming of the audible phenomena observable
in the Capitol, so all the watchmen say, is a ghostly footstep that
seems to follow anybody who crosses Statuary Hall at night. It was in
this hall, then the chamber of the House of Representatives, that John
Quincy Adams died--at a spot indicated now by a brass tablet set in a
stone slab, where stood his desk. Whether or not it is his ghost that
pursues is a question open to dispute, though it is to be hoped that the
venerable ex-President rests more quietly in his grave. At all events,
the performance is unpleasant, and even gruesome for him who walks
across that historic floor, while the white marble statues of dead
statesmen placed around the walls seem to point at him with outstretched
arms derisively. Like the man in Coleridge's famous lines he

          "--walks in fear and dread,
           Because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread."

At all events he is uncertain lest such may be the case. And, of course,
the duties of the watchman oblige him, when so assigned, to patrol the
basement of the building, where all sorts of hobgoblins lie in wait.

One of the Capitol policemen was almost frightened out of his wits one
night when a pair of flaming eyes looked out at him from the vaults
under the chamber of the House of Representatives where the wood is
stored for the fires. It was subsequently ascertained that the eyes in
question were those of a fox, which, being chevied through the town, had
sought refuge in the cellar of the edifice occupied by the national
Legislature. The animal was killed for the reason which obliges a white
man to slay any innocent beast that comes under his power.

But, speaking of the steps which follow a person at night across the
floor of Statuary Hall, a bold watchman attempted not long ago to
investigate them on scientific principles. He suspected a trick, and so
bought a pair of rubber shoes, with the aid of which he proceeded to
examine into the question. In the stillness of the night he made a
business of patrolling that portion of the principal Government edifice,
and, sure enough, the footsteps followed along behind him. He cornered
them; it was surely some trickster! There was no possibility for the
joker to get away. But, a moment later, the steps were heard in another
part of the hall; they had evaded him successfully. Similar experiments
were tried on other nights, but they all ended in the same way.

Four years ago there died in Washington an old gentleman who had been
employed for thirty-five years in the Library of Congress. The quarters
of that great book collection, while housed in the Capitol, were
distressingly restricted, and much of the cataloguing was done by the
veteran mentioned in a sort of vault in the sub-cellar. This vault was
crammed with musty tomes from floor to ceiling, and practically no air
was admitted. It was a wonder that he lived so long, but, when he came
to die, he did it rather suddenly. Anyhow, he became paralyzed and
unable to speak, though up to the time of his actual demise he was able
to indicate his wants by gestures. Among other things, he showed plainly
by signs that he wished to be conveyed to the old library.

This wish of his was not obeyed, for reasons which seemed sufficient to
his family, and, finally, he relinquished it by giving up the ghost. It
was afterward learned that he had hidden, almost undoubtedly, $6000
worth of registered United States bonds among the books in his
sub-cellar den--presumably, concealed between the leaves of some of the
moth-eaten volumes of which he was the appointed guardian. Certainly,
there could be no better or less-suspected hiding-place, but this was
just where the trouble came in for the heirs, in whose interest the
books were vainly searched and shaken, when the transfer of the library
from the old to its new quarters was accomplished. The heirs cannot
secure a renewal of the bonds by the Government without furnishing proof
of the loss of the originals, which is lacking, and, meanwhile, it is
said that the ghost of the old gentleman haunts the vault in the
sub-basement which he used to inhabit, looking vainly for the missing
securities.

The old gentleman referred to had some curious traits, though he was by
no means a miser--such as the keeping of every burnt match that he came
across. He would put them away in the drawer of his private desk,
together with expired street-car transfers--the latter done up in neat
bundles, with India-rubber bands.

Quite an intimate friend he had, named Twine, who lost his grip on the
perch, so to speak, about six years back. Mr. Twine dwelt during the
working hours of the day in a sort of cage of iron, like that of
Dreyfus, in the basement of the Capitol. As a matter of fact, Dreyfus
does not occupy a cage at all; the notion that he does so arises from a
misunderstanding of the French word "case," which signifies a hut.

However, Twine's cage was a real one of iron wire, and inside of it he
made a business of stamping the books of the library with a mixture made
of alcohol and lampblack. If the observation of casual employees about
the Capitol is to be trusted, Mr. Twine's ghost is still engaged at
intervals in the business of stamping books at the old stand, though his
industry must be very unprofitable since the Government's literary
collection has been moved out of the Capitol.

Ghosts are supposed to appertain most appropriately to the lower
regions, inasmuch as the ancients who described them first consigned
the blessed as well as the damned to a nether world. Consequently, it is
not surprising to find that phantoms of the Capitol are mostly relegated
to the basement.

Exceptions are made in the case of Vice-President Wilson, who, as will
be remembered, died in his room at the Senate end of the building, and
also with respect to John Quincy Adams, whose nocturnal perambulations
are so annoying to the watchmen. Mr. Wilson is only an occasional
visitor on the premises, it is understood, finding his way thither,
probably, when nothing else of importance is "up," so to speak, in the
spiritual realm which now claims him for its own. It is related that on
one occasion he nearly frightened to death a watchman who was guarding
the coffin of a Tennessee Senator who was lying in state in the Senate
Chamber. The startle was doubtless uncontemplated, inasmuch as the
Senator was too well bred a man to take anybody unpleasantly by
surprise.

There was a watchman, employed quite a while ago as a member of the
Capitol police, who was discharged finally for drunkenness. No faith,
therefore, is to be placed in his sworn statement, which was actually
made, to the effect that on a certain occasion he passed through the old
Hall of Representatives--now Statuary Hall--and saw in session the
Congress of 1848, with John Quincy Adams and many other men whose names
have long ago passed into history. It was, if the word of the witness is
to be believed, a phantom legislative crew, resembling in kind if not in
character the goblins which Rip Van Winkle encountered on his trip to
the summits of the storied Catskills.

But--to come down to things that are well authenticated and sure,
comparatively speaking--the basement of the Capitol, as has been said,
is the part of the building chiefly haunted. Beneath the hall of the
House of Representatives strolls by night a melancholy specter, with
erect figure, a great mustache, and his hands clasped behind him. Who he
is nobody has ever surmised; he might be, judging from his aspect, a
foreigner in the diplomatic service, but that is merely guess. Watchmen
at night have approached him in the belief that he was an intruder, but
he has faded from sight instantly, like a picture on a magic-lantern
slide.

At precisely 12.30 of the clock every night, so it is said, the door of
the room occupied by the Committee on Military and Militia of the Senate
opens silently, and there steps forth the figure of General Logan,
recognizable by his long black hair, military carriage, and the hat he
was accustomed to wear in life.

Logan was the chairman of this committee, and, if report be credited, he
is still supervising its duties.


A GENUINE GHOST

(Philadelphia _Press_, March 25, 1884)

DAYTON, O., March 25.--A thousand people surround the grave yard in
Miamisburg, a town near here, every night to witness the antics of what
appears to be a genuine ghost. There is no doubt about the existence of
the apparition, as Mayor Marshall, the revenue collector and hundreds of
prominent citizens all testify to having seen it. Last night several
hundred people, armed with clubs and guns, assaulted the specter, which
appeared to be a woman in white. Clubs, bullets and shot tore the air in
which the mystic figure floated without disconcerting it in the least. A
portion of the town turned out en masse to-day and began exhuming all
the bodies in the cemetery.

The remains of the Buss family, composed of three people, have already
been exhumed. The town is visited daily by hundreds of strangers and
none are disappointed, as the apparition is always on duty promptly at 9
o'clock. The strange figure was at once recognized by the inhabitants of
the town as a young lady supposed to have been murdered several years
ago. Her attitude while drifting among the graves is one of deep
thought, with the head inclined forward and hands clasped behind.


THE BAGGAGEMAN'S GHOST

"The corpses of the passengers killed in the disaster up at Spuyten
Duyvil was fetched down here and laid out in[1] The room was darkened
and I could just make out the out that storage room," said a Grand
Central depot baggageman. "That's what give it the name of morgue. Some
of the boys got scared of going in after that, 'specially in the dark;
and a lot of stories was started about spooks. We had a helper (a
drunken chap that didn't know whether he saw a thing or dreamed it), and
he swore to the toughest of the yarns. He says he went in to get a
trunk. It was a whopper, and he braced himself for a big strain; but,
when he gripped it, it come up just as if there wasn't nothing in it
more'n air or gas. That unexpected kind of a lift is like kicking at
nothing--it's hurtful, don't you know?"

"I should think so."

"Well, Joe felt as light-headed as the trunk, he says, but he brought it
out. When he was putting it down he was stunned to see a ghost sitting
straddle of it."

"What did the ghost look like?"

"Joe was so scared that he can't tell, except that it had grave-clothes
on. And it went out of sight as soon as he got out into the
daylight--floated off, and at the same instant the trunk became as heavy
as such a trunk generally is. Some of us believe Joe's story, and some
don't, and he's one of them that does. He throwed up his job rather than
go into the morgue again."


DRUMMERS SEE A SPECTER

(St Louis _Globe-Democrat_, Oct. 6, 1887)

[The last man in the world to be accused of a belief in the supernatural
would be your go-ahead, hard-headed American "drummer" or traveling-man.
Yet here is a plain tale of how not one but two of the western
fraternity saw a genuine ghost in broad daylight a few years ago.--ED.]

JACKSON, MO., October 6. At a place on the Turnpike road, between Cape
Girardeau and Jackson, is what is familiarly known as Spooks' Hollow.
The place is situated fours miles from the Cape and is awfully dismal
looking where the road curves gracefully around a high bluff.

Two drummers, representing a single leading wholesale house of St.
Louis, were recently making the drive from Jackson to the Cape, when
their attention was suddenly attracted at the Spooks' Hollow by a white
and airy object which arose in its peculiar form so as to be plainly
visible and then maneuvered in every imaginable manner, finally taking a
zigzag wayward journey through the low dismal-looking surroundings,
disappearing suddenly into the mysterious region from whence it came.

More than one incident of dreadful experience has been related of this
gloomy abode, and the place is looked upon by the midnight tourist and
the lonesome citizen on his nocturnal travels as an unpleasant spot,
isolated from the beautiful country which surrounds it.


DR. FUNK SEES THE SPIRIT OF BEECHER

(New York _Herald_, April 4, 1903)

While he will not admit that he is a believer in spiritualism, the Rev.
Dr. Isaac Funk, head of the publishing house of Funk & Wagnalls, is so
impressed with manifestations he has received from the spirit of Henry
Ward Beecher that he has laid the entire matter before the Boston
Society for Psychical Research, and is anxiously awaiting a solution or
explanation of what appears to him, after twenty-five years' study of
the subject, the most remarkable test of the merit of the claims of
spiritualists that has ever come within his observation.

Although he has resorted to every means within his power to discover any
fraud that may have been practiced upon him, he has been unable to
explain away not only messages to him from the great minister, but the
actual appearance to him of Mr. Beecher in the flesh.

Dr. Funk and Mr. Beecher were intimate friends, and it would be
difficult to practice deception as to Mr. Beecher's appearance. When the
apparition appeared to Dr. Funk at a sÃ©ance a short time ago Dr. Funk
was less than three feet distant from it, and had plenty of opportunity
to detect a fraud if it was being perpetrated, he believes.

"Every feature stood out distinctly," Dr. Funk said yesterday, in
describing his experience, "even to the hair and eyes, the color of the
skin and the expression of the mouth.[1] lines of the body, but it was
still light enough to make the face plainly visible. I had a short
conversation with the embodied spirit, and then it appeared to sink to
the floor and fade away."


MYSTERY OF THE COINS

Dr. Funk was especially anxious to have an opportunity to see and talk
with Mr. Beecher, in the hope that light would be thrown on the mystery
which surrounds a previous manifestation. Through the spirit of one
"Jack" Rakestraw, who says he used to lead the choir in one of Mr.
Beecher's churches, but frankly admits that he cannot remember exactly
where the church was located--even spirits have a way of forgetting
things, spiritualists declare--Dr. Funk was informed that Mr. Beecher
was troubled because the publisher had failed to return a coin, known as
the "widow's mite," which he had borrowed some years ago, from the late
Professor Charles E. West, a well known numismatist, to make a cut to
illustrate a dictionary. Dr. Funk supposed the coin had been returned a
long time ago, but upon looking the matter up found it in a drawer of a
safe, among some old papers, exactly as Mr. Rakestraw maintained.

When Mr. Beecher appeared to him in person, so far as he could
determine, Dr. Funk asked him several direct questions, to which the
replies, he admits, were somewhat sublime. Although Dr. Funk has found
the long-lost coin--which, by the way, is said to be worth $2,500--he is
not certain to whom it should be returned, now that Professor West is
dead and his collection of coins sold. Should the "widow's mite" go to
Professor West's heirs or to the purchaser of the collection? is a
question which has as yet remained unanswered.

"That is a matter I am leaving to be determined by the Society for
Psychical Research and Mrs. Piper, who ought to be able to learn from
the spirit world what disposition Professor West wishes to have made of
the coin," said Dr. Funk. It is at any rate a matter that does not
appear to concern the spirit of Mr. Beecher.


MR. BEECHER APPEASED

"When what seemed to be Mr. Beecher's embodied spirit appeared to me,"
Dr. Funk said, "I asked that very question. He smiled and replied that
it was not a matter that concerned him especially, and that the whole
thing was in the nature of a test, to prove to me that there actually
are spirits, and that it is possible to have communication with them
when all the conditions are favorable. He remarked that he was glad the
old coin had been found, but seemed to consider the disposition of it a
matter of minor importance. He told me he was glad I was taking interest
in the subject, as he believed it would result in good for the world,
and then, excusing himself on the ground that he had an engagement which
it was necessary for him to keep, the apparition disappeared."

Dr. Funk borrowed the coin from Professor West's collection, as a
lighter colored one he already had was of doubtful authenticity. Both
coins were sent to the government expert in Philadelphia and the lighter
one was declared to be the genuine one. By the spirits it is now
declared, however, that a mistake was made and that the darker one
belonging to Professor West has the greater value.

"I found both the light and the dark one in the drawer," said Dr. Funk,
"and remembered distinctly that it was the darker of the two which I had
borrowed from Professor West. I went to the next sÃ©ance, and when
Rakestraw's spirit arrived I asked him to find out which one was to be
returned. After a brief interval his voice came to me.

"'Return the dark one, of course,' he said. 'That is the genuine coin
and is the one you borrowed from Dr. Beecher's friend.'

"While I do not wish to be classed as a believer in Spiritualism, I
certainly am open to conviction after what has come under my personal
observation," Dr. Funk concluded. "I am confident that no fraud was
practiced on me at the sÃ©ance at which I was told about the old coin.
The medium is an elderly woman living in Brooklyn, who never appears in
public, and the only persons present were members of her family and
known to me. But none of them knew any more about the coin being in my
safe than I did."


MARYLAND GHOSTS

(_Baltimore American_, May, 1886)

For forty years the Rev. Dr. B. has been the rector of a prominent
parish on the Eastern Shore. He had, when the scenes recorded below
happened twenty-two years ago, a mission charge sixteen miles distant
from the town in which he resided, and he was therefore constantly
traveling between these two places. About six miles distant was the
country residence of Judge S., a well-known and venerable parishioner of
the worthy doctor. The sod had been turned above this gentleman's grave
only about six weeks, when Dr. B. chanced to be returning from his
mission charge in company with a friend. It was broad daylight, just
about sunset, and not far from Judge S.'s gate, when a carriage, drawn
by a white horse, passed them rapidly from behind and was soon out of
sight.

"That fellow must be in a hurry to reach C.," remarked the doctor.

"Did you notice anything peculiar about that vehicle?" inquired his
companion.

"Only that it moves very quietly. I heard no sound as it went by."

"Nor did I," said his friend. "Neither rattling of wheels nor noise of
hoofs. It is certainly strange."

       *       *       *       *       *

The matter, however, was soon forgotten in other conversation, and they
had traveled perhaps a mile, when suddenly, the same horse and carriage
passed them as before. Nothing was discernible of the driver except his
feet, the carriage curtains hiding his body. There was no cross road by
which a vehicle in front could possibly have got behind without making a
circuit of many miles and consuming several hours. Yet there was not the
shadow of a doubt as to the identity of the vehicle, and the two
gentlemen gazed at each other in blank amazement, and with a certain
defined sense of awe which precluded any discussion of the matter,
particularly as the horse was to all appearances the well-known white
habitually driven by the deceased Judge. A half mile brought them in
sight of Judge S.'s gate, when for the third time the ghostly team
dashed by in the same dreadful mysterious silence. This time it turned
in full view into the gate. Without a word of comment the doctor
quickened his horse's speed, and reached the gate only a few yards
behind the silent driver. Both gentlemen peered eagerly up the long,
open lane leading to the house; but neither carriage nor wheel-track was
visible, though it was still clear daylight, and there was no outlet
from the lane, nor could any vehicle in the time occupied accomplish
half the distance. The peculiar features of this strange incident are
that it was equally and simultaneously evident to two witnesses, both
entirely unprepared for any such manifestation, and differing widely in
temperament, habits of life, mental capacity and educational
attainments, and by mere accident making this journey together, and that
to this day both of them--witnesses, be it noted, of unimpeachable
credibility--attest it, and fully corroborate each other, but without
being able to suggest the slightest explanation.


THE GHOST OF PEG ALLEY'S POINT

Peg Alley's Point is a long and narrow strip of wooded land, situated
between the main stream of Miles river and one of the navigable creeks
which flow into it. This little peninsula is about two miles long, from
fifty to three hundred yards in width and is bounded by deep water and
is overgrown with pine and thick underbrush. There is extant a tradition
to the effect that many years ago a party of Baltimore oystermen
encamped on the point, among whom was a man named Alley, who had
abandoned his wife. The deserted woman followed up her husband, and
found him at the camp. After some conversation had passed between them,
the man induced her, upon some unknown pretext, to accompany him into a
thicket. The poor wife never came out alive. Her husband cruelly
murdered her with a club. The point of land has ever since been known by
Peg Alley's name, and her perturbed spirit has been supposed to haunt
the scene of her untimely taking off. About twelve years ago a gang of
rail-splitters were at work on the point, and one day the foreman flatly
refused to go back, declaring that queer things happened down there, and
that he had seen a ghost. Mr. Kennedy, his employer, laughed at him and
dismissed the matter from his mind. Some time after this Mr. Kennedy had
occasion to ride through the woods to look after some sheep, there being
but one road and the water on either side. As he approached the point
his horse started violently and refused to go on, regardless of whip or
spur. Glancing about for the cause of this unnatural fright, he saw a
woman rise up from a log, a few yards in advance, and stand by the
roadside, looking at him. She was very poorly clad in a faded calico
dress, and wore a limp sun-bonnet, from beneath which her thin,
jet-black hair straggled down on her shoulders; her face was thin and
sallow and her eyes black and piercing. Knowing that she had no business
there, and occupied in controlling his horse, he called to her somewhat
angrily to get out of the way, as his animal was afraid of her. Slowly
she turned and walked into the thicket, uttering not a syllable and
looking reproachfully at him as she went. With much difficulty he forced
his horse to the spot, hoping to find out who the strange intruder might
be, but the most careful search failed to reveal the trace of any one,
although there was no place of concealment and no possible way of
escape, for which, indeed, there was not sufficient time.


AN APPARITION AND DEATH

The old family seat of the T.'s, one of the most prominent names in the
community, is not far from the scenes of the above-mentioned adventure.
In all this region of lovely situations and charming water views, its
site is one of the most beautiful. The brick mansion, with all the
strangely mixed comforts and discomforts of ancient architecture, rears
its roof up from an elevated lawn, while the silvery thread of a
land-locked stream winds nearly around the whole. Over the further bank
dance the sparkling waters of a broad estuary, flashing in the glance of
the sunshine or tossing its white-capped billows in angry mimicry of the
sea. The gleam of white sails is never lacking to add variety and
picturesqueness to the scene. In the dead, hushed calm of a summer
evening, when the lifted oar rests on the gunwale, unwilling to disturb
with its dip the glassy surface, one has a strange, dreamy sense of
being suspended in space, the sky, in all its changing beauties, being
accurately reflected in illimitable depth by the still water, until the
charm is broken by the splash and ripple of a school of nomadic alewives
or the gliding, sinuous fin of a piratical shark. In this lovely home it
was wont for the family to assemble on the occasion of certain domestic
celebrations, and it was at one of these that the following incident
occurred: All were present except one member, who was detained by
sickness at her residence, fifteen miles away. It was in early afternoon
that one of the ladies standing at an open window, suddenly exclaimed:
"Why, there's Aunt Milly crossing the flower garden!" The party
approached the window, and beheld, in great surprise, the lady, in her
ordinary costume, slowly strolling among the flowers. She paused and
looked earnestly at the group, her features plainly visible; then turned
and disappeared amidst the shrubbery. No trace of her presence being
discoverable, it was natural that a gloom fell upon the company. A few
hours later a messenger arrived with the intelligence of her death. The
time of her apparition and the time of her death coincided.


AN IDIOT GHOST WITH BRASS BUTTONS

(Philadelphia _Press_, June 16, 1889)

In a pretty but old-fashioned house in Stuyvesant square--ghosts like
squares, I think--is another ghost. This house stood empty for several
years, and about six years ago a gentleman, his wife and little daughter
moved in there, and while fitting up allowed the child to play about
the empty attic, which had apparently been arranged for a children's
playroom long ago. There was a fireplace and a large fireboard in front
of it.

When the house was about finished down stairs the mother began to pay
more attention to the little girl and tried to keep her down there with
her, but the child always stole away and went back up stairs again and
again, until finally the mother asked why she liked to go up there so
much. She replied that she liked to play with the funny little boy.
Investigation showed that it was utterly impossible for any person, man
or child, to get in that place or be concealed there, but the little
girl insisted and told her parents that he "went in there," pointing to
the fireboard.

The parents were seriously concerned, believing that their daughter was
telling them an untruth, and threatened to punish her for it, but she
insisted so strongly that she saw and played with a "funny little boy,
with lots of brass buttons on his jacket," that they finally gave up
threatening and resolved to investigate.

The father, who is an old sea captain, found out that this house had
been occupied by an Englishman named Cowdery who had had three
children--two boys and a girl. One of the boys was an idiot. This idiot
was supposed to have fallen into the East River, as his cap was found
there, and he had always shown a liking for the river when his nurse
took him out. Soon after this Mr. Cowdery moved West.

This was enough for my friend's friend, who had the fireboard taken
down, and short work in the wall by the side of the chimney brought the
body of the unfortunate idiot boy. The back of his skull was crushed in.
He still had the dark blue jacket on, with four rows of buttons on the
front. The poor little bones were buried and the affair kept quiet, but
the captain left the house.


A MODEL GHOST STORY

(Boston _Courier_, Aug. 10)

A very singular story which forms one of the sensational social topics
of the day is the best authenticated of the many stories of the
supernatural that have been lately told. Only a short time ago a young
and well-known artist, Mr. A., was invited to pay a visit to his
distinguished friend, Mr. Izzard. The house was filled with guests, but
a large and handsome room was placed at his disposal, apparently one of
the best in the house. For three days he had a delightful visit;
delightful in all particulars save one, he had each night a horrible
dream. He dreamed he was--or was really--suddenly awakened by some
person entering his room, and in looking around saw the room brilliantly
lighted, while at the window stood a lady elegantly attired, in the act
of throwing something out. This accomplished, she turned her face toward
the only spectator showing a countenance so distorted by evil passions
that he was thrilled with horror. Soon the light and the figure with the
dreadful face disappeared, leaving the artist suffering from a frightful
nightmare. On returning to his city home he was so haunted by the
fearful countenance which had for three consecutive nights troubled him,
that he made a sketch of it, and so real that the evil expression seemed
to horrify every one who saw it. Not a great while after, the artist
went to make an evening visit on Mr. Izzard; that gentleman invited him
to his picture gallery, as he wished to show him some remarkable, old
family portraits. What was Mr. A.'s surprise to recognize among them, in
the likeness of a stately, well-dressed lady, the one who had so
troubled his slumbers on his previous visit, lacking, however, the
revolting, wicked expression. Soon as he saw it he involuntarily
exclaimed, "Why, I have seen that lady!" "Indeed!" said Mr. I., smiling,
"that is hardly possible, as she died more than a hundred years ago. She
was the second wife of my great-grandfather, and reflected anything but
credit on the family. She was strongly suspected of having murdered her
husband's son by a former marriage, in order to make her own child heir
to the property. The unfortunate boy broke his neck in a fall from a
window, and there was every reason to believe that he was precipitated
from the window by his stepmother." The artist then told his host the
circumstances of his thrice-repeated experience, or dream, and sent for
his sketch, which, so far as the features were concerned, was identical
with the portrait in Mr. Izzard's gallery. The sketch has since been
photographed, but from its hideous expression is not very pleasant to
look upon.


A GHOST THAT WILL NOT DOWN

(Cincinnati _Enquirer_, Sept. 30, 1884)

GRANTSVILLE, W. VA., September 30.--The ghost of Betts' farm will not
lay. Something over a year ago the _Enquirer_ contained an account or an
occult influence or manifestation at the farm house of Mr. Collins
Betts, about three miles below this town, in which story were delineated
a number of weird, strange instances of ghostly manifestations, all of
which were verified by the testimony of honest, brave and reliable
citizens, the names of many of whom were mentioned. That story went the
rounds of newspapers all over the country and resulted in the proprietor
of the place receiving hundreds of letters from all over the country.

Since then the old house has been torn down, the family of Mr. Betts
rebuilding a home place on a different portion of the farm. This act, it
was believed, would lay or forever quiet the ramblings and queer doings
of the inexplicable mystery. But such has not been the case. Since the
building has been razed the mysterious manifestation has made itself
visible at places sometimes quite a distance from the scene of its
former domicile.

At a distance of several hundred yards from the old Betts place a
neighboring farmer had erected a house in which he intended to reside,
and in fact did reside a short time, but the "Cale Betts ghost," as the
manifestation is commonly called for a distance of many miles, was no
respecter of persons and oblivious of distance, and it so annoyed and
frightened the farmer and his family at untoward times that he has
removed his house to the opposite end of the farm, leaving his garden,
orchard and all the improvements usually made about a farm-house to take
care of themselves.

This in itself was considered strange enough, but the ghostly visitant
did not stop there. The high road, running some distance away, has been
the theater of almost numberless scenes of frights and frightful
appearances. Among those who have lately seen the ghost is a young man
named Vandevener, whose father had once been frightened nearly to death,
as related in a former letter. Young Vandevener had frequently made
sport of the old man's fright, but he does so no more--in fact, the
young man is willing to make affidavit that the old man's story was
mildly drawn.

The young man was driving along quietly one night about half a mile from
the Betts place, when he saw a strange being, which, in the pale light
of the moon, he took to be a man walking at the head of his horses. A
few minutes later the man, or whatever it was, glided, without making a
particle of noise, around the horses' heads and got into the wagon and
took a seat by his side.

Young Vandevener says it rode along with him several hundred yards, and
spoke to him. It first told him not to be afraid, as it did not intend
to injure him in the least. What it said he will not tell, except that
it admonished him not to say anything about it until a certain time.
After it had spoken to him Vandevener says it got up and glided off into
the woods and disappeared. He says the shape was that of a headless man,
and that while it was with him he felt a cold chill run over him,
although it was a warm evening, and this chilly feeling did not leave
him until the disappearance of the shape.

Since then Vandevener can not be induced to go over the ground after
night. He still persists in the same story, and as he is a truthful
young fellow, the people who know him are satisfied that he really saw
what he claims to have seen.

Only one day last week another young man, Henry Stephens I believe, on
his way past the same place, saw a peculiar shape rise out of the brush
by the side of the road and glide along by the side of the wagon.
Stephens got out of his wagon and gathered together a handful of rocks,
which he threw at the object. Some of the stones appeared to go through
it, but did not seem to affect it in the least. It still continued to
float along at a short distance away until Stephens became frightened
and whipped up his horses until they flew at a two-minute gait down the
road, the object following at some distance until quite away from the
scene of its first appearance, when it disappeared like a cloud of
vapor. There are dozens of authentic stories of the ghostly
peculiarities of the Betts ghost which are new and peculiar.

It appears, since the destruction of the Betts homestead, to have taken
up its quarters near the highway, and here it appears to people who have
generally scoffed and laughed at the former stories. That it is
bullet-proof does not need testimony, located, as it is, in a section of
country which has for years been noted for its fearless men--such as the
Duskys, Downs and others of national fame as sharp-shooters, scouts,
etc., during the late war. None of these men have succeeded in "laying"
or putting a quietus to it. There is a story that a couple of men had
been murdered or disappeared in this vicinity, and that the ghost is the
uneasy spirit of one of these men, but there is no real evidence that
anybody was ever killed there.

There is no doubt that Calhoun County has a mystery which neither time,
bullets, courage nor philosophy can either drive away or explain. It has
come to stay. If you meet a Calhouner just mention it, and he will tell
you that the "Betts ghost" is a county possession which it will gladly
dispose of at any price.


TOM CYPHER'S PHANTOM ENGINE

(Seattle _Press-Times_, Jan. 10, 1892)

Locomotive engineers are as a class said to be superstitious, but J.M.
Pinckney, an engineer known to almost every Brotherhood man, is an
exception to the rule. He has never been able to believe the different
stories told of apparitions suddenly appearing on the track, but he had
an experience last Sunday night on the Northern Pacific east-bound
overland that made his hair stand on end.

By the courtesy of the engineer, also a Brotherhood man, Mr. Pinckney
was riding on the engine. They were recounting experiences, and the
fireman, who was a green hand, was getting very nervous as he listened
to the tales of wrecks and disasters, the horrors of which were
graphically described by the veteran engineers.

The night was clear and the rays from the headlight flashed along the
track, and, although they were interested in spinning yarns, a sharp
lookout was kept, for they were rapidly nearing Eagle gorge, in the
Cascades, the scene of so many disasters and the place which is said to
be the most dangerous on the 2,500 miles of road. The engineer was
relating a story and was just coming to the climax when he suddenly
grasped the throttle, and in a moment had "thrown her over," that is,
reversed the engine. The air brakes were applied and the train brought
to a standstill within a few feet of the place where Engineer Cypher met
his death two years ago. By this time the passengers had become curious
as to what was the matter, and all sorts of questions were asked the
trainmen. The engineer made an excuse that some of the machinery was
loose, and in a few moments the train was speeding on to her
destination.

"What made you stop back there?" asked Pinckney. "I heard your excuse,
but I have run too long on the road not to know that your excuse is not
the truth."

His question was answered by the engineer pointing ahead and saying
excitedly:

"There! Look there! Don't you see it?"

"Looking out of the cab window," said Mr. Pinckney, "I saw about 300
yards ahead of us the headlight of a locomotive."

"Stop the train, man," I cried, reaching for the lever.

"Oh, it's nothing. It's what I saw back at the gorge. It's Tom Cypher's
engine, No. 33. There's no danger of a collision. The man who is
running that ahead of us can run it faster backward than I can this one
forward. Have I seen it before? Yes, twenty times. Every engineer on the
road knows that engine, and he's always watching for it when he gets to
the gorge."

"The engine ahead of us was running silently, but smoke was puffing from
the stack and the headlight threw out rays of red, green, and white
light. It kept a short distance ahead of us for several miles, and then
for a moment we saw a figure on the pilot. Then the engine rounded a
curve and we did not see it again. We ran by a little station, and at
the next, when the operator warned us to keep well back from a wild
engine that was ahead, the engineer said nothing. He was not afraid of a
collision. Just to satisfy my own mind on the matter I sent a telegram
to the engine wiper at Sprague, asking him if No. 33 was in. I received
a reply stating that No. 33 had just come in, and that her coal was
exhausted and boxes burned out. I suppose you'll be inclined to laugh at
the story, but just ask any of the boys, although many of them won't
talk about it. I would not myself if I were running on the road. It's
unlucky to do so."

With this comment upon the tale Mr. Pinckney boarded a passing caboose
and was soon on his way to Tacoma. It is believed by Northern Pacific
engineers that Thomas Cypher's spirit still hovers near Eagle gorge.


GHOSTS IN CONNECTICUT

(N.Y. _Sun_, Sept. 1, 1885)

"There is as much superstition in New-England to-day as there was in
those old times when they slashed Quakers and built bonfires for
witches." It was a New York man who gave expression to this rather
startling statement. He has been summering in Connecticut, and he avers
that his talk about native superstition is founded on close observation.
Perhaps it is; anyhow he regaled the _Times's_ correspondent with some
entertaining incidents which he claims establish the truth of his
somewhat astonishing theories.

Old Stratford, the whitewashed town between this place and Bridgeport,
made famous by mysterious "rappings" many years ago, and more recently
celebrated as the scene of poor Rose Clark Ambler's strange murder, is
much concerned over a house which the almost universal verdict
pronounces "haunted." The family of Elihu Osborn lives in this house,
and ghosts have been clambering through it lately in a wonderfully
promiscuous fashion. Two or three families were compelled to vacate the
premises before the Osborns, proud and skeptical, took possession of
them. Now the Osborns are hunting for a new home. Children of the family
have been awakened at midnight by visitors which persisted in shaking
them out of bed; Mrs. Osborn has been confronted with ghostly
spectacles, and through the halls and vacant rooms strange footsteps are
frequently heard when all the family are trying to sleep; sounds loud
enough to arouse every member of the household. Then the manifestations
sometimes change to moanings and groanings sufficiently vehement and
pitiful to distract all who hear them. Once upon a time, perhaps a dozen
years ago, Jonathan Riggs lived in this house, and as the local gossips
assert, Riggs caused the death of his wife by his brutal conduct and
then swallowed poison to end his own life. The anniversary of the
murderous month in the Riggs family has arrived and the manifestations
are so frequent and so lively that "the like has never been seen
before," as is affirmed by a veteran Stratford citizen. There is no
shadow of doubt in Stratford that the spirits of the Riggses are spryly
cavorting around their former abode.

Over at the Thimble Islands, off Stony Creek, is an acre or two of soil
piled high on a lot of rocks. The natives call it Frisbie Island. Not
more than a hundred yards off shore it contains a big bleak looking
house which was built about twenty years ago to serve as a Summer hotel
when Connecticut capitalists were deep in schemes to tempt New Yorkers
to this part of the Sound shore to spend their Summers. New Yorkers
declined to be tempted, and the old house is rapidly approaching decay.
It has recently assumed a peculiar interest for the residents of Stony
Creek. Midnight lights have suddenly appeared in all its windows at
frequent intervals, fitfully flashing up and down like the blaze in the
Long Island lighthouses. Ghosts! This is the universal verdict. Nobody
disputes it. Once or twice a hardy crew of local sailors have
volunteered to go out and investigate the mystery, but when the time for
the test has arrived, there somehow have always been reasons for
postponing the excursion. Cynical people profess to believe that
practical jokers are at the root of the manifestations, but such a
profane view is not widely entertained among the good people who have
their homes at Stony Creek.

Over near Middletown is a farmer named Edgar G. Stokes, a gentleman who
is said to have graduated with honor in a New England college more than
a quarter of a century ago. He enjoys, perhaps, the most notable bit of
superstition to be found anywhere in this country, in or out of
Connecticut. He owns the farm on which he lives, and it is valuable; not
quite so valuable though as it once was, for Mr. Stokes's eccentric
disposition has somewhat changed the usual tactics that farmers pursue
when they own fertile acres. The average man clears his soil of stones;
Mr. Stokes has been piling rocks all over his land. Little by little the
weakness--or philosophy--has grown upon him; and not only from every
part of Middlesex County, but from every part of this State he has been
accumulating wagonloads of pebbles and rocks. He seeks for no peculiar
stone either in shape, color, or quality. If they are stones that is
sufficient. And his theory is that stones have souls--souls, too, that
are not so sordid and earthly as the souls that animate humanity. They
are souls purified and exalted. In the rocks are the spirits of the
greatest men who have lived in past ages, developed by some divinity
until they have become worthy of their new abode. Napoleon Bonaparte's
soul inhabits a stone, so does Hannibal's, so does CÃ¦sar's, but poor
plebeian John Smith and William Jenkins, they never attained such
immortality.

Farmer Stokes has dumped his rocks with more or less reverence all along
his fields, and this by one name and that by another he knows and hails
them all. A choice galaxy of the distinguished lights of the old days
are in his possession, and just between the burly bits of granite at
the very threshold of his home is a smooth-faced crystal from the Rocky
Mountains. This stone has no soul yet. The rough, jagged rock on its
left is George Washington. The granite spar on the right is glorified
with the spirit of good Queen Bess. The smooth-faced crystal one of
these days is to know the bliss of swallowing up the spirit of good
Farmer Edgar Garton Stokes. It was not until recently that mystified
neighbors obtained the secret of the vast accumulation of rough stones
on the Stokes farm. Mr. Stokes has a family. They all seem to be
intelligent, practical business people. There may be a will contested in
Middletown one of these days.


THE SPOOK OF DIAMOND ISLAND

(St. Louis _Globe-Democrat_, Sept. 18, 1888)

HARDEN, Ill., Sept. 18.--For some time past rumors have been circulated
in Hardin to the effect that Diamond Island, in the river about two
miles from this place, was the home of a ghost. The stories concerning
the movements of the alleged spook were, of course, not given any
credence at first, but later, when several reputable citizens of Hardin
announced that they had positively seen an uncanny looking object moving
about on the island at night, the rumors were more seriously considered.
Now, after investigation, the mysterious something is no longer
considered a myth.

Along toward midnight a peculiar light is seen at the foot of the
island. It has the appearance of a huge ball of fire, and is about the
size and shape of an ordinary barrel.

A few nights ago a party of young men from this place determined to
visit the island and fathom the mystery if possible. Equipped with
revolvers, knives, shotguns, and clubs, the party secured a boat and
were soon cutting through the water at a good speed for a point on the
island near where the specter usually made its appearance. Arriving at
the landing place, the skiff was hauled up on the shore and the young
men took up a position in a clump of trees close at hand to watch and
wait.

Suddenly the whole point of the island was illumined as a bright red
object rose apparently from the water and glided up into the air.
Ascending probably to a height of forty yards, the watchers saw the
lurid ball fade away. The investigating party had seen all they wanted.
They made a mad rush for the boat, but, just as they reached the place
where it had been left, they were horrified to see the little craft
moving out on the water from the island. At first its only occupant
seemed to be the red ball of fire, but the next moment the watchers saw
the crimson object gradually take the form of a man, and they saw him,
too, dip the oars at regular intervals and pull a long, steady stroke.
The man's features were fully concealed by a wide-rimmed slouch hat,
which was drawn over his face. A peculiar light illumined the boat and
the waters around it, making the craft and its mysterious occupant
perfectly discernible to the party on the shore, who stood paralyzed
with fear, unable to speak or move, their eyes riveted by some
mysterious influence they could not resist on the spectral object before
them.

The boat was now about in midstream, and suddenly the group of watchers
saw the skiff's occupant change again into the crimson ball. Then it
slowly began to move upward, and when it was about parallel with the
tops of the trees on the island it disappeared. Next instant the
watchers looking across the river saw nothing but the flickering lights
in Hardin.

The cries of the crowd on the island awakened a sleeping fisherman on
the opposite side of the river, and he kindly pulled across and rescued
the ghost-seeking youths. The fiery spook, it is said, still makes its
nightly trips to Diamond Island, but no more investigating parties have
ventured across to solve the mystery.

It is said that some years ago a foul murder was committed on this
island, and by the superstitious the crimson object is believed to be
the restless spirit of the slain man.


THE GHOST'S FULL HOUSE

(N.Y. _Sun_, April 10, 1891)

The Bleecker street ghost drew as large a "house" last night as Barnum's
Circus or any of the theaters. There was a bigger crowd about
"Cohnfeld's Folly" than there was three weeks ago when the flames gutted
the buildings from Mercer to Greene streets and did damage away up in
the millions. The wraith was not due till midnight, but the street was
packed with watchers as early as 9 o'clock. The crowd was so dense that
pedestrians with difficulty forced their way through it and twice a
squad of blue-coats descended on the mob and routed it. Five minutes
after the police had retired the street was as impassable as before.

In the midst of the ruins of the big fire a single wall towers away
above the surrounding brick partitions. It looks feeble and almost
tottering and the shop-keepers in the vicinity say that when there is a
high wind it sways to and fro and threatens to come down in a heap.
After dark the outlines of the summit of this wall are very indistinct.
The detail of the wreck could not be made out even in last night's
bright starlight. There is a sheet of tin, however, on the top of the
wall, which was probably a cornice before the fire. Only one side of it
is attached to the brickwork, and when there is any wind it trembles in
the breeze and rattles with an uncertain sound. It may have been that
the sheen of the tin in the starlight or a windy night first suggested
the idea of a ghost to some weird imagination.

There is an old Frenchman living in the vicinity, however, who avers
that three nights ago he saw with his own eyes a lady in white standing
out against the darkened sky on the very summit of the tottering wall.
Her long, flowing robes fluttered in the breeze, and even while he
watched there came a low, wailing sound, and the wraith dissolved into
air. He kept his eye fixed on the spot for a full minute, but the vision
did not reappear, and as he turned to walk away he thought he heard
groaning as of a lost spirit. The sound, he says, made his blood run
cold and kept him shivering the whole night through.

The alleged appearance of the ghost has set the whole neighborhood a
talking, and some of the "old residenters" have recalled a murder which
took place in the vicinity many years ago, when A.T. Stewart lived there
and the street was one of the fashionable places of residence of the
town. There was a wealthy old gentleman of foreign birth who lived in
the street and was quite a recluse. He would pass the time of day with
his neighbors when he met them in the street, but he was never known to
enter into conversation with any one. The blinds were always drawn in
his front windows, and at night there was not a ray of light to be seen
about the house. His only servants were a couple somewhat advanced in
years, who were as foreign and uncommunicative as himself. The master of
the house would be away for months at a time and the neighbors had all
sorts of theories as to his disappearances. Some thought he was engaged
in unlawful business, others suggested that his absence might be
attributed to the supernatural, but those who were less flighty
concluded that he simply went off on periodical visits to his native
land.

On his return from one of these visits, however, the old gentleman
brought with him a beautiful young girl. She was little more than a
child in appearance, and had the soft eyes, olive complexion and lithe,
graceful figure of a Spaniard. She was never seen alive after she passed
the shadow of the old man's doorway. A few weeks later the old gentleman
disappeared as mysteriously as if he had been snatched up into the
clouds. The old couple who kept his home walked away one day and never
returned. There was an investigation, and in a hole dug in the cellar
was found the body of the beautiful young girl. There were no marks on
her body, and it was supposed she had been smothered. The exact date of
this tragedy is not fixed. Inspector Byrnes says that if it ever
occurred it was before his time.

The ghost, if ghost there is, is undoubtedly the spirit of this
unfortunate and nameless young woman. A _World_ reporter watched the
Bleecker street ruins with the crowd last night and was there at the
midnight hour, but never a sign of a ghost did he see. There were those
in the crowd, nevertheless, who thought or pretended to think that they
did. Once there was a rattling sound in the ruins, which caused a
commotion among the lookers-on, but it was only because a small boy had
shied a brick at the old wall. The living spirits boomed the liquor
business in the saloons of the vicinity. A skull and cross-bones over
one of these bars was surmounted with the somewhat appropriate legend
freshly painted:

"In the midst of life we are in debt."

CASE I

A PSYCHICAL INVASION


â€œAnd what is it makes you think I could be of use in this particular
case?â€ asked Dr. John Silence, looking across somewhat sceptically at
the Swedish lady in the chair facing him.

â€œYour sympathetic heart and your knowledge of occultism----â€

â€œOh, please--that dreadful word!â€ he interrupted, holding up a finger
with a gesture of impatience.

â€œWell, then,â€ she laughed, â€œyour wonderful clairvoyant gift and your
trained psychic knowledge of the processes by which a personality may
be disintegrated and destroyed--these strange studies youâ€™ve been
experimenting with all these years----â€

â€œIf itâ€™s only a case of multiple personality I must really cry off,â€
interrupted the doctor again hastily, a bored expression in his eyes.

â€œItâ€™s not that; now, please, be serious, for I want your help,â€ she
said; â€œand if I choose my words poorly you must be patient with my
ignorance. The case I know will interest you, and no one else could
deal with it so well. In fact, no ordinary professional man could deal
with it at all, for I know of no treatment or medicine that can restore
a lost sense of humour!â€

â€œYou begin to interest me with your â€˜case,â€™â€ he replied, and made
himself comfortable to listen.

Mrs. Sivendson drew a sigh of contentment as she watched him go to the
tube and heard him tell the servant he was not to be disturbed.

â€œI believe you have read my thoughts already,â€ she said; â€œyour
intuitive knowledge of what goes on in other peopleâ€™s minds is
positively uncanny.â€

Her friend shook his head and smiled as he drew his chair up to a
convenient position and prepared to listen attentively to what she had
to say. He closed his eyes, as he always did when he wished to absorb
the real meaning of a recital that might be inadequately expressed,
for by this method he found it easier to set himself in tune with the
living thoughts that lay behind the broken words.

By his friends John Silence was regarded as an eccentric, because
he was rich by accident, and by choice--a doctor. That a man of
independent means should devote his time to doctoring, chiefly
doctoring folk who could not pay, passed their comprehension entirely.
The native nobility of a soul whose first desire was to help those who
could not help themselves, puzzled them. After that, it irritated them,
and, greatly to his own satisfaction, they left him to his own devices.

Dr. Silence was a free-lance, though, among doctors, having neither
consulting-room, bookkeeper, nor professional manner. He took no
fees, being at heart a genuine philanthropist, yet at the same time
did no harm to his fellow-practitioners, because he only accepted
unremunerative cases, and cases that interested him for some very
special reason. He argued that the rich could pay, and the very poor
could avail themselves of organised charity, but that a very large
class of ill-paid, self-respecting workers, often followers of the
arts, could not afford the price of a weekâ€™s comforts merely to be told
to travel. And it was these he desired to help: cases often requiring
special and patient study--things no doctor can give for a guinea, and
that no one would dream of expecting him to give.

But there was another side to his personality and practice, and one
with which we are now more directly concerned; for the cases that
especially appealed to him were of no ordinary kind, but rather of that
intangible, elusive, and difficult nature best described as psychical
afflictions; and, though he would have been the last person himself to
approve of the title, it was beyond question that he was known more or
less generally as the â€œPsychic Doctor.â€

In order to grapple with cases of this peculiar kind, he had submitted
himself to a long and severe training, at once physical, mental, and
spiritual. What precisely this training had been, or where undergone,
no one seemed to know,--for he never spoke of it, as, indeed, he
betrayed no single other characteristic of the charlatan,--but the fact
that it had involved a total disappearance from the world for five
years, and that after he returned and began his singular practice no
one ever dreamed of applying to him the so easily acquired epithet of
quack, spoke much for the seriousness of his strange quest and also for
the genuineness of his attainments.

For the modern psychical researcher he felt the calm tolerance of the
â€œman who knows.â€ There was a trace of pity in his voice--contempt he
never showed--when he spoke of their methods.

â€œThis classification of results is uninspired work at best,â€ he said
once to me, when I had been his confidential assistant for some years.
â€œIt leads nowhere, and after a hundred years will lead nowhere. It is
playing with the wrong end of a rather dangerous toy. Far better, it
would be, to examine the causes, and then the results would so easily
slip into place and explain themselves. For the sources are accessible,
and open to all who have the courage to lead the life that alone makes
practical investigation safe and possible.â€

And towards the question of clairvoyance, too, his attitude was
significantly sane, for he knew how extremely rare the genuine power
was, and that what is commonly called clairvoyance is nothing more than
a keen power of visualising.

â€œIt connotes a slightly increased sensibility, nothing more,â€ he would
say. â€œThe true clairvoyant deplores his power, recognising that it adds
a new horror to life, and is in the nature of an affliction. And you
will find this always to be the real test.â€

Thus it was that John Silence, this singularly developed doctor, was
able to select his cases with a clear knowledge of the difference
between mere hysterical delusion and the kind of psychical affliction
that claimed his special powers. It was never necessary for him to
resort to the cheap mysteries of divination; for, as I have heard him
observe, after the solution of some peculiarly intricate problem--

â€œSystems of divination, from geomancy down to reading by tea-leaves,
are merely so many methods of obscuring the outer vision, in order
that the inner vision may become open. Once the method is mastered, no
system is necessary at all.â€

And the words were significant of the methods of this remarkable man,
the keynote of whose power lay, perhaps, more than anything else,
in the knowledge, first, that thought can act at a distance, and,
secondly, that thought is dynamic and can accomplish material results.

â€œLearn how to _think_,â€ he would have expressed it, â€œand you have
learned to tap power at its source.â€

To look at--he was now past forty--he was sparely built, with speaking
brown eyes in which shone the light of knowledge and self-confidence,
while at the same time they made one think of that wondrous gentleness
seen most often in the eyes of animals. A close beard concealed the
mouth without disguising the grim determination of lips and jaw,
and the face somehow conveyed an impression of transparency, almost
of light, so delicately were the features refined away. On the
fine forehead was that indefinable touch of peace that comes from
identifying the mind with what is permanent in the soul, and letting
the impermanent slip by without power to wound or distress; while, from
his manner,--so gentle, quiet, sympathetic,--few could have guessed the
strength of purpose that burned within like a great flame.

â€œI think I should describe it as a psychical case,â€ continued the
Swedish lady, obviously trying to explain herself very intelligently,
â€œand just the kind you like. I mean a case where the cause is hidden
deep down in some spiritual distress, and----â€

â€œBut the symptoms first, please, my dear Svenska,â€ he interrupted, with
a strangely compelling seriousness of manner, â€œand your deductions
afterwards.â€

She turned round sharply on the edge of her chair and looked him in the
face, lowering her voice to prevent her emotion betraying itself too
obviously.

â€œIn my opinion thereâ€™s only one symptom,â€ she half whispered, as though
telling something disagreeable--â€œfear--simply fear.â€

â€œPhysical fear?â€

â€œI think not; though how can I say? I think itâ€™s a horror in the
psychical region. Itâ€™s no ordinary delusion; the man is quite sane; but
he lives in mortal terror of something----â€

â€œI donâ€™t know what you mean by his â€˜psychical region,â€™â€ said the
doctor, with a smile; â€œthough I suppose you wish me to understand that
his spiritual, and not his mental, processes are affected. Anyhow, try
and tell me briefly and pointedly what you know about the man, his
symptoms, his need for help, _my_ peculiar help, that is, and all that
seems vital in the case. I promise to listen devotedly.â€

â€œI am trying,â€ she continued earnestly, â€œbut must do so in my own words
and trust to your intelligence to disentangle as I go along. He is a
young author, and lives in a tiny house off Putney Heath somewhere. He
writes humorous stories--quite a genre of his own: Pender--you must
have heard the name--Felix Pender? Oh, the man had a great gift, and
married on the strength of it; his future seemed assured. I say â€˜had,â€™
for quite suddenly his talent utterly failed him. Worse, it became
transformed into its opposite. He can no longer write a line in the
old way that was bringing him success----â€

Dr. Silence opened his eyes for a second and looked at her.

â€œHe still writes, then? The force has not gone?â€ he asked briefly, and
then closed his eyes again to listen.

â€œHe works like a fury,â€ she went on, â€œbut produces nothingâ€--she
hesitated a moment--â€œnothing that he can use or sell. His earnings have
practically ceased, and he makes a precarious living by book-reviewing
and odd jobs--very odd, some of them. Yet, I am certain his talent has
not really deserted him finally, but is merely----â€

Again Mrs. Sivendson hesitated for the appropriate word.

â€œIn abeyance,â€ he suggested, without opening his eyes.

â€œObliterated,â€ she went on, after a moment to weigh the word, â€œmerely
obliterated by something else----â€

â€œBy some _one_ else?â€

â€œI wish I knew. All I can say is that he is haunted, and temporarily
his sense of humour is shrouded--gone--replaced by something dreadful
that writes other things. Unless something competent is done, he will
simply starve to death. Yet he is afraid to go to a doctor for fear of
being pronounced insane; and, anyhow, a man can hardly ask a doctor to
take a guinea to restore a vanished sense of humour, can he?â€

â€œHas he tried any one at all----?â€

â€œNot doctors yet. He tried some clergymen and religious people; but
they _know_ so little and have so little intelligent sympathy. And
most of them are so busy balancing on their own little pedestals----â€

John Silence stopped her tirade with a gesture.

â€œAnd how is it that you know so much about him?â€ he asked gently.

â€œI know Mrs. Pender well--I knew her before she married him----â€

â€œAnd is she a cause, perhaps?â€

â€œNot in the least. She is devoted; a woman very well educated, though
without being really intelligent, and with so little sense of humour
herself that she always laughs at the wrong places. But she has
nothing to do with the cause of his distress; and, indeed, has chiefly
guessed it from observing him, rather than from what little he has
told her. And he, you know, is a really lovable fellow, hard-working,
patient--altogether worth saving.â€

Dr. Silence opened his eyes and went over to ring for tea. He did
not know very much more about the case of the humorist than when he
first sat down to listen; but he realised that no amount of words from
his Swedish friend would help to reveal the real facts. A personal
interview with the author himself could alone do that.

â€œAll humorists are worth saving,â€ he said with a smile, as she poured
out tea. â€œWe canâ€™t afford to lose a single one in these strenuous days.
I will go and see your friend at the first opportunity.â€

She thanked him elaborately, effusively, with many words, and he, with
much difficulty, kept the conversation thenceforward strictly to the
teapot.

And, as a result of this conversation, and a little more he had
gathered by means best known to himself and his secretary, he was
whizzing in his motor-car one afternoon a few days later up the Putney
Hill to have his first interview with Felix Pender, the humorous writer
who was the victim of some mysterious malady in his â€œpsychical regionâ€
that had obliterated his sense of the comic and threatened to wreck his
life and destroy his talent. And his desire to help was probably of
equal strength with his desire to know and to investigate.

The motor stopped with a deep purring sound, as though a great black
panther lay concealed within its hood, and the doctor--the â€œpsychic
doctor,â€ as he was sometimes called--stepped out through the gathering
fog, and walked across the tiny garden that held a blackened fir tree
and a stunted laurel shrubbery. The house was very small, and it was
some time before any one answered the bell. Then, suddenly, a light
appeared in the hall, and he saw a pretty little woman standing on
the top step begging him to come in. She was dressed in grey, and the
gaslight fell on a mass of deliberately brushed light hair. Stuffed,
dusty birds, and a shabby array of African spears, hung on the wall
behind her. A hat-rack, with a bronze plate full of very large cards,
led his eye swiftly to a dark staircase beyond. Mrs. Pender had round
eyes like a childâ€™s, and she greeted him with an effusiveness that
barely concealed her emotion, yet strove to appear naturally cordial.
Evidently she had been looking out for his arrival, and had outrun the
servant girl. She was a little breathless.

â€œI hope youâ€™ve not been kept waiting--I think itâ€™s _most_ good of you
to come----â€ she began, and then stopped sharp when she saw his face in
the gaslight. There was something in Dr. Silenceâ€™s look that did not
encourage mere talk. He was in earnest now, if ever man was.

â€œGood evening, Mrs. Pender,â€ he said, with a quiet smile that won
confidence, yet deprecated unnecessary words, â€œthe fog delayed me a
little. I am glad to see you.â€

They went into a dingy sitting-room at the back of the house, neatly
furnished but depressing. Books stood in a row upon the mantelpiece.
The fire had evidently just been lit. It smoked in great puffs into the
room.

â€œMrs. Sivendson said she thought you might be able to come,â€ ventured
the little woman again, looking up engagingly into his face and
betraying anxiety and eagerness in every gesture. â€œBut I hardly dared
to believe it. I think it is really too good of you. My husbandâ€™s case
is so peculiar that--well, you know, I am quite sure any _ordinary_
doctor would say at once the asylum----â€

â€œIsnâ€™t he in, then?â€ asked Dr. Silence gently.

â€œIn the asylum?â€ she gasped. â€œOh dear, no--not yet!â€

â€œIn the house, I meant,â€ he laughed.

She gave a great sigh.

â€œHeâ€™ll be back any minute now,â€ she replied, obviously relieved to see
him laugh; â€œbut the fact is, we didnâ€™t expect you so early--I mean, my
husband hardly thought you would come at all.â€

â€œI am always delighted to come--when I am really wanted, and can be of
help,â€ he said quickly; â€œand, perhaps, itâ€™s all for the best that your
husband is out, for now that we are alone you can tell me something
about his difficulties. So far, you know, I have heard very little.â€

Her voice trembled as she thanked him, and when he came and took a
chair close beside her she actually had difficulty in finding words
with which to begin.

â€œIn the first place,â€ she began timidly, and then continuing with a
nervous incoherent rush of words, â€œhe will be simply delighted that
youâ€™ve really come, because he said you were the only person he would
consent to see at all--the only doctor, I mean. But, of course, he
doesnâ€™t know how frightened I am, or how much I have noticed. He
pretends with me that itâ€™s just a nervous breakdown, and Iâ€™m sure he
doesnâ€™t realise all the odd things Iâ€™ve noticed him doing. But the main
thing, I suppose----â€

â€œYes, the main thing, Mrs. Pender,â€ he said encouragingly, noticing her
hesitation.

â€œ----is that he thinks we are not alone in the house. Thatâ€™s the chief
thing.â€

â€œTell me more facts--just facts.â€

â€œIt began last summer when I came back from Ireland; he had been here
alone for six weeks, and I thought him looking tired and queer--ragged
and scattered about the face, if you know what I mean, and his manner
worn out. He said he had been writing hard, but his inspiration had
somehow failed him, and he was dissatisfied with his work. His sense of
humour was leaving him, or changing into something else, he said. There
was something in the house, he declared, thatâ€--she emphasised the
words--â€œprevented his feeling funny.â€

â€œSomething in the house that prevented his feeling funny,â€ repeated the
doctor. â€œAh, now weâ€™re getting to the heart of it!â€

â€œYes,â€ she resumed vaguely; â€œthatâ€™s what he kept saying.â€

â€œAnd what was it he _did_ that you thought strange?â€ he asked
sympathetically. â€œBe brief, or he may be here before you finish.â€

â€œVery small things, but significant it seemed to me. He changed his
workroom from the library, as we call it, to the sitting-room. He
said all his characters became wrong and terrible in the library;
they altered, so that he felt like writing tragedies--vile, debased
tragedies, the tragedies of broken souls. But now he says the same of
the smoking-room, and heâ€™s gone back to the library.â€

â€œAh!â€

â€œYou see, thereâ€™s so little I can tell you,â€ she went on, with
increasing speed and countless gestures. â€œI mean itâ€™s only very small
things he does and says that are queer. What frightens me is that he
assumes there is some one else in the house all the time--some one I
never see. He does not actually say so, but on the stairs Iâ€™ve seen him
standing aside to let some one pass; Iâ€™ve seen him open a door to let
some one in or out; and often in our bedroom he puts chairs about as
though for some one else to sit in. Oh--oh yes, and once or twice,â€ she
cried--â€œonce or twice----â€

She paused, and looked about her with a startled air.

â€œYes?â€

â€œOnce or twice,â€ she resumed hurriedly, as though she heard a sound
that alarmed her, â€œIâ€™ve heard him running--coming in and out of the
rooms breathless as if something were after him----â€

The door opened while she was still speaking, cutting her words off in
the middle, and a man came into the room. He was dark and clean-shaven
sallow rather, with the eyes of imagination, and dark hair growing
scantily about the temples. He was dressed in a shabby tweed suit, and
wore an untidy flannel collar at the neck. The dominant expression of
his face was startled--hunted; an expression that might any moment
leap into the dreadful stare of terror and announce a total loss of
self-control.

The moment he saw his visitor a smile spread over his worn features,
and he advanced to shake hands.

â€œI hoped you would come; Mrs. Sivendson said you might be able to find
time,â€ he said simply. His voice was thin and reedy. â€œI am very glad to
see you, Dr. Silence. It is â€˜Doctor,â€™ is it not?â€

â€œWell, I am entitled to the description,â€ laughed the other, â€œbut I
rarely get it. You know, I do not practise as a regular thing; that is,
I only take cases that specially interest me, or----â€

He did not finish the sentence, for the men exchanged a glance of
sympathy that rendered it unnecessary.

â€œI have heard of your great kindness.â€

â€œItâ€™s my hobby,â€ said the other quickly, â€œand my privilege.â€

â€œI trust you will still think so when you have heard what I have to
tell you,â€ continued the author, a little wearily. He led the way
across the hall into the little smoking-room where they could talk
freely and undisturbed.

In the smoking-room, the door shut and privacy about them, Penderâ€™s
attitude changed somewhat, and his manner became very grave. The doctor
sat opposite, where he could watch his face. Already, he saw, it
looked more haggard. Evidently it cost him much to refer to his trouble
at all.

â€œWhat I have is, in my belief, a profound spiritual affliction,â€ he
began quite bluntly, looking straight into the otherâ€™s eyes.

â€œI saw that at once,â€ Dr. Silence said.

â€œYes, you saw that, of course; my atmosphere must convey that much to
any one with psychic perceptions. Besides which, I feel sure from all
Iâ€™ve heard, that you are really a soul-doctor, are you not, more than a
healer merely of the body?â€

â€œYou think of me too highly,â€ returned the other; â€œthough I prefer
cases, as you know, in which the spirit is disturbed first, the body
afterwards.â€

â€œI understand, yes. Well, I have experienced a curious disturbance
in--_not_ in my physical region primarily. I mean my nerves are all
right, and my body is all right I have no delusions exactly, but my
spirit is tortured by a calamitous fear which first came upon me in a
strange manner.â€

John Silence leaned forward a moment and took the speakerâ€™s hand and
held it in his own for a few brief seconds, closing his eyes as he
did so. He was not feeling his pulse, or doing any of the things that
doctors ordinarily do; he was merely absorbing into himself the main
note of the manâ€™s mental condition, so as to get completely his own
point of view, and thus be able to treat his case with true sympathy. A
very close observer might perhaps have noticed that a slight tremor ran
through his frame after he had held the hand for a few seconds.

â€œTell me quite frankly, Mr. Pender,â€ he said soothingly, releasing the
hand, and with deep attention in his manner, â€œtell me all the steps
that led to the beginning of this invasion. I mean tell me what the
particular drug was, and why you took it, and how it affected you----â€

â€œThen you know it began with a drug!â€ cried the author, with
undisguised astonishment.

â€œI only know from what I observe in you, and in its effect upon myself.
You are in a surprising psychical condition. Certain portions of your
atmosphere are vibrating at a far greater rate than others. This is the
effect of a drug, but of no ordinary drug. Allow me to finish, please.
If the higher rate of vibration spreads all over, you will become, of
course, permanently cognisant of a much larger world than the one you
know normally. If, on the other hand, the rapid portion sinks back to
the usual rate, you will lose these occasional increased perceptions
you now have.â€

â€œYou amaze me!â€ exclaimed the author; â€œfor your words exactly describe
what I have been feeling----â€

â€œI mention this only in passing, and to give you confidence before
you approach the account of your real affliction,â€ continued the
doctor. â€œAll perception, as you know, is the result of vibrations; and
clairvoyance simply means becoming sensitive to an increased scale of
vibrations. The awakening of the inner senses we hear so much about
means no more than that. Your partial clairvoyance is easily explained.
The only thing that puzzles me is how you managed to procure the drug,
for it is not easy to get in pure form, and no adulterated tincture
could have given you the terrific impetus I see you have acquired. But,
please proceed now and tell me your story in your own way.â€

â€œThis _Cannabis indica_,â€ the author went on, â€œcame into my possession
last autumn while my wife was away. I need not explain how I got it,
for that has no importance; but it was the genuine fluid extract, and
I could not resist the temptation to make an experiment. One of its
effects, as you know, is to induce torrential laughter----â€

â€œYes; sometimes.â€

â€œ----I am a writer of humorous tales, and I wished to increase my own
sense of laughter--to see the ludicrous from an abnormal point of view.
I wished to study it a bit, if possible, and----â€

â€œTell me!â€

â€œI took an experimental dose. I starved for six hours to hasten the
effect, locked myself into this room, and gave orders not to be
disturbed. Then I swallowed the stuff and waited.â€

â€œAnd the effect?â€

â€œI waited one hour, two, three, four, five hours. Nothing happened. No
laughter came, but only a great weariness instead. Nothing in the room
or in my thoughts came within a hundred miles of a humorous aspect.â€

â€œAlways a most uncertain drug,â€ interrupted the doctor. â€œWe make very
small use of it on that account.â€

â€œAt two oâ€™clock in the morning I felt so hungry and tired that I
decided to give up the experiment and wait no longer. I drank some
milk and went upstairs to bed. I felt flat and disappointed. I fell
asleep at once and must have slept for about an hour, when I awoke
suddenly with a great noise in my ears. It was the noise of my
own laughter! I was simply shaking with merriment. At first I was
bewildered and thought I had been laughing in dreams, but a moment
later I remembered the drug, and was delighted to think that after
all I had got an effect. It had been working all along, only I had
miscalculated the time. The only unpleasant thing _then_ was an odd
feeling that I had not waked naturally, but had been wakened by some
one else--deliberately. This came to me as a certainty in the middle of
my noisy laughter and distressed me.â€

â€œAny impression who it could have been?â€ asked the doctor, now
listening with close attention to every word, very much on the alert.

Pender hesitated and tried to smile. He brushed his hair from his
forehead with a nervous gesture.

â€œYou must tell me all your impressions, even your fancies; they are
quite as important as your certainties.â€

â€œI had a vague idea that it was some one connected with my forgotten
dream, some one who had been at me in my sleep, some one of great
strength and great ability--of great force--quite an unusual
personality--and, I was certain, too--a woman.â€

â€œA good woman?â€ asked John Silence quietly.

Pender started a little at the question and his sallow face flushed;
it seemed to surprise him. But he shook his head quickly with an
indefinable look of horror.

â€œEvil,â€ he answered briefly, â€œappallingly evil, and yet mingled with
the sheer wickedness of it was also a certain perverseness--the
perversity of the unbalanced mind.â€

He hesitated a moment and looked up sharply at his interlocutor. A
shade of suspicion showed itself in his eyes.

â€œNo,â€ laughed the doctor, â€œyou need not fear that Iâ€™m merely humouring
you, or think you mad. Far from it. Your story interests me exceedingly
and you furnish me unconsciously with a number of clues as you tell it.
You see, I possess some knowledge of my own as to these psychic byways.â€

â€œI was shaking with such violent laughter,â€ continued the narrator,
reassured in a moment, â€œthough with no clear idea what was amusing me,
that I had the greatest difficulty in getting up for the matches, and
was afraid I should frighten the servants overhead with my explosions.
When the gas was lit I found the room empty, of course, and the door
locked as usual. Then I half dressed and went out on to the landing,
my hilarity better under control, and proceeded to go downstairs. I
wished to record my sensations. I stuffed a handkerchief into my mouth
so as not to scream aloud and communicate my hysterics to the entire
household.â€

â€œAnd the presence of this--this----?â€

â€œIt was hanging about me all the time,â€ said Pender, â€œbut for the
moment it seemed to have withdrawn. Probably, too, my laughter killed
all other emotions.â€

â€œAnd how long did you take getting downstairs?â€

â€œI was just coming to that I see you know all my â€˜symptomsâ€™ in advance,
as it were; for, of course, I thought I should never get to the bottom.
Each step seemed to take five minutes, and crossing the narrow hall at
the foot of the stairs--well, I could have sworn it was half an hourâ€™s
journey had not my watch certified that it was a few seconds. Yet I
walked fast and tried to push on. It was no good. I walked apparently
without advancing, and at that rate it would have taken me a week to
get down Putney Hill.â€

â€œAn experimental dose radically alters the scale of time and space
sometimes----â€

â€œBut, when at last I got into my study and lit the gas, the change came
horridly, and sudden as a flash of lightning. It was like a douche of
icy water, and in the middle of this storm of laughter----â€

â€œYes; what?â€ asked the doctor, leaning forward and peering into his
eyes.

â€œ----I was overwhelmed with terror,â€ said Pender, lowering his reedy
voice at the mere recollection of it.

He paused a moment and mopped his forehead. The scared, hunted look in
his eyes now dominated the whole face. Yet, all the time, the corners
of his mouth hinted of possible laughter as though the recollection of
that merriment still amused him. The combination of fear and laughter
in his face was very curious, and lent great conviction to his story;
it also lent a bizarre expression of horror to his gestures.

â€œTerror, was it?â€ repeated the doctor soothingly.

â€œYes, terror; for, though the Thing that woke me seemed to have gone,
the memory of it still frightened me, and I collapsed into a chair.
Then I locked the door and tried to reason with myself, but the
drug made my movements so prolonged that it took me five minutes to
reach the door, and another five to get back to the chair again. The
laughter, too, kept bubbling up inside me--great wholesome laughter
that shook me like gusts of wind--so that even my terror almost made
me laugh. Oh, but I may tell you, Dr. Silence, it was altogether vile,
that mixture of fear and laughter, altogether vile!

â€œThen, all at once, the things in the room again presented their
funny side to me and set me off laughing more furiously than ever.
The bookcase was ludicrous, the arm-chair a perfect clown, the way
the clock looked at me on the mantelpiece too comic for words; the
arrangement of papers and inkstand on the desk tickled me till I roared
and shook and held my sides and the tears streamed down my cheeks. And
that footstool! Oh, that absurd footstool!â€

He lay back in his chair, laughing to himself and holding up his hands
at the thought of it, and at the sight of him Dr. Silence laughed too.

â€œGo on, please,â€ he said, â€œI quite understand. I know something myself
of the hashish laughter.â€

The author pulled himself together and resumed, his face growing
quickly grave again.

â€œSo, you see, side by side with this extravagant, apparently causeless
merriment, there was also an extravagant, apparently causeless terror.
The drug produced the laughter, I knew; but what brought in the terror
I could not imagine. Everywhere behind the fun lay the fear. It was
terror masked by cap and bells; and I became the playground for two
opposing emotions, armed and fighting to the death. Gradually, then,
the impression grew in me that this fear was caused by the invasion--so
you called it just now--of the â€˜personâ€™ who had wakened me: she was
utterly evil; inimical to my soul, or at least to all in me that wished
for good. There I stood, sweating and trembling, laughing at everything
in the room, yet all the while with this white terror mastering my
heart. And this creature was putting--putting her----â€

He hesitated again, using his handkerchief freely.

â€œPutting what?â€

â€œ----putting ideas into my mind,â€ he went on, glancing nervously about
the room. â€œActually tapping my thought-stream so as to switch off the
usual current and inject her own. How mad that sounds! I know it,
but itâ€™s true. Itâ€™s the only way I can express it. Moreover, while
the operation terrified me, the skill with which it was accomplished
filled me afresh with laughter at the clumsiness of men by comparison.
Our ignorant, bungling methods of teaching the minds of others, of
inculcating ideas, and so on, overwhelmed me with laughter when I
understood this superior and diabolical method. Yet my laughter seemed
hollow and ghastly, and ideas of evil and tragedy trod close upon the
heels of the comic. Oh, doctor, I tell you again, it was unnerving!â€

John Silence sat with his head thrust forward to catch every word of
the story which the other continued to pour out in nervous, jerky
sentences and lowered voice.

â€œYou _saw_ nothing--no one--all this time?â€ he asked.

â€œNot with my eyes. There was no visual hallucination. But in my mind
there began to grow the vivid picture of a woman--large, dark-skinned,
with white teeth and masculine features, and one eye--the left--so
drooping as to appear almost closed. Oh, such a face----!â€

â€œA face you would recognise again?â€

Pender laughed dreadfully.

â€œI wish I could forget it,â€ he whispered, â€œI only wish I could forget
it!â€ Then he sat forward in his chair suddenly, and grasped the
doctorâ€™s hand with an emotional gesture.

â€œI _must_ tell you how grateful I am for your patience and sympathy,â€
he cried, with a tremor in his voice, â€œand--that you do not think
me mad. I have told no one else a quarter of all this, and the
mere freedom of speech--the relief of sharing my affliction with
another--has helped me already more than I can possibly say.â€

Dr. Silence pressed his hand and looked steadily into the frightened
eyes. His voice was very gentle when he replied.

â€œYour case, you know, is very singular, but of absorbing interest to
me,â€ he said, â€œfor it threatens, not your physical existence, but
the temple of your psychical existence--the inner life. Your mind
would not be permanently affected here and now, in this world; but in
the existence after the body is left behind, you might wake up with
your spirit so twisted, so distorted, so befouled, that you would be
_spiritually insane_--a far more radical condition than merely being
insane here.â€

There came a strange hush over the room, and between the two men
sitting there facing one another.

â€œDo you really mean--Good Lord!â€ stammered the author as soon as he
could find his tongue.

â€œWhat I mean in detail will keep till a little later, and I need only
say now that I should not have spoken in this way unless I were quite
positive of being able to help you. Oh, thereâ€™s no doubt as to that,
believe me. In the first place, I am very familiar with the workings
of this extraordinary drug, this drug which has had the chance effect
of opening you up to the forces of another region; and, in the second,
I have a firm belief in the reality of super-sensuous occurrences as
well as considerable knowledge of psychic processes acquired by long
and painful experiment. The rest is, or should be, merely sympathetic
treatment and practical application. The hashish has partially opened
another world to you by increasing your rate of psychical vibration,
and thus rendering you abnormally sensitive. Ancient forces attached to
this house have attacked you. For the moment I am only puzzled as to
their precise nature; for were they of an ordinary character, I should
myself be psychic enough to feel them. Yet I am conscious of feeling
nothing as yet. But now, please continue, Mr. Pender, and tell me the
rest of your wonderful story; and when you have finished, I will talk
about the means of cure.â€

Pender shifted his chair a little closer to the friendly doctor and
then went on in the same nervous voice with his narrative.

â€œAfter making some notes of my impressions I finally got upstairs again
to bed. It was four oâ€™clock in the morning. I laughed all the way
up--at the grotesque banisters, the droll physiognomy of the staircase
window, the burlesque grouping of the furniture, and the memory of that
outrageous footstool in the room below; but nothing more happened to
alarm or disturb me, and I woke late in the morning after a dreamless
sleep, none the worse for my experiment except for a slight headache
and a coldness of the extremities due to lowered circulation.â€

â€œFear gone, too?â€ asked the doctor.

â€œI seemed to have forgotten it, or at least ascribed it to mere
nervousness. Itâ€™s reality had gone, anyhow for the time, and all
that day I wrote and wrote and wrote. My sense of laughter seemed
wonderfully quickened and my characters acted without effort out of
the heart of true humour. I was exceedingly pleased with this result
of my experiment But when the stenographer had taken her departure and
I came to read over the pages she had typed out, I recalled her sudden
glances of surprise and the odd way she had looked up at me while I was
dictating. I was amazed at what I read and could hardly believe I had
uttered it.â€

â€œAnd why?â€

â€œIt was so distorted. The words, indeed, were mine so far as I could
remember, but the meanings seemed strange. It frightened me. The sense
was so altered. At the very places where my characters were intended to
tickle the ribs, only curious emotions of sinister amusement resulted.
Dreadful innuendoes had managed to creep into the phrases. There was
laughter of a kind, but it was bizarre, horrible, distressing; and
my attempt at analysis only increased my dismay. The story, as it
read then, made me shudder, for by virtue of these slight changes it
had come somehow to hold the soul of horror, of horror disguised as
merriment. The framework of humour was there, if you understand me, but
the characters had turned sinister, and their laughter was evil.â€

â€œCan you show me this writing?â€

The author shook his head.

â€œI destroyed it,â€ he whispered. â€œBut, in the end, though of course
much perturbed about it, I persuaded myself that it was due to some
after-effect of the drug, a sort of reaction that gave a twist to my
mind and made me read macabre interpretations into words and situations
that did not properly hold them.â€

â€œAnd, meanwhile, did the presence of this person leave you?â€

â€œNo; that stayed more or less. When my mind was actively employed I
forgot it, but when idle, dreaming, or doing nothing in particular,
there she was beside me, influencing my mind horribly----â€

â€œIn what way, precisely?â€ interrupted the doctor.

â€œEvil, scheming thoughts came to me, visions of crime, hateful pictures
of wickedness, and the kind of bad imagination that so far has been
foreign, indeed impossible, to my normal nature----â€

â€œThe pressure of the Dark Powers upon the personality,â€ murmured the
doctor, making a quick note.

â€œEh? I didnâ€™t quite catch----â€

â€œPray, go on. I am merely making notes; you shall know their purport
fully later.â€

â€œEven when my wife returned I was still aware of this Presence in the
house; it associated itself with my inner personality in most intimate
fashion; and outwardly I always felt oddly constrained to be polite and
respectful towards it--to open doors, provide chairs and hold myself
carefully deferential when it was about. It became very compelling at
last, and, if I failed in any little particular, I seemed to know that
it pursued me about the house, from one room to another, haunting my
very soul in its inmost abode. It certainly came before my wife so far
as my attentions were concerned.

â€œBut, let me first finish the story of my experimental dose, for I took
it again the third night, and underwent a very similar experience,
delayed like the first in coming, and then carrying me off my feet
when it did come with a rush of this false demon-laughter. This time,
however, there was a reversal of the changed scale of space and
time; it shortened, instead of lengthened, so that I dressed and got
downstairs in about twenty seconds, and the couple of hours I stayed
and worked in the study passed literally like a period of ten minutes.â€

â€œThat is often true of an overdose,â€ interjected the doctor, â€œand you
may go a mile in a few minutes, or a few yards in a quarter of an hour.
It is quite incomprehensible to those who have never experienced it,
and is a curious proof that time and space are merely forms of thought.â€

â€œThis time,â€ Pender went on, talking more and more rapidly in his
excitement, â€œanother extraordinary effect came to me, and I experienced
a curious changing of the senses, so that I perceived external things
through one large main sense-channel instead of through the five
divisions known as sight, smell, touch, and so forth. You will, I
know, understand me when I tell you that I _heard_ sights and _saw_
sounds. No language can make this comprehensible, of course, and I
can only say, for instance, that the striking of the clock I saw as a
visible picture in the air before me. I saw the sounds of the tinkling
bell. And in precisely the same way I heard the colours in the room,
especially the colours of those books in the shelf behind you. Those
red bindings I heard in deep sounds, and the yellow covers of the
French bindings next to them made a shrill, piercing note not unlike
the chattering of starlings. That brown bookcase muttered, and those
green curtains opposite kept up a constant sort of rippling sound like
the lower notes of a wood-horn. But I only was conscious of these
sounds when I looked steadily at the different objects, and thought
about them. The room, you understand, was not full of a chorus of
notes; but when I concentrated my mind upon a colour, I heard, as well
as saw, it.â€

â€œThat is a known, though rarely-obtained, effect of _Cannabis indica_,â€
observed the doctor. â€œAnd it provoked laughter again, did it?â€

â€œOnly the muttering of the cupboard-bookcase made me laugh. It was so
like a great animal trying to get itself noticed, and made me think
of a performing bear--which is full of a kind of pathetic humour, you
know. But this mingling of the senses produced no confusion in my
brain. On the contrary, I was unusually clear-headed and experienced
an intensification of consciousness, and felt marvellously alive and
keen-minded.

â€œMoreover, when I took up a pencil in obedience to an impulse to
sketch--a talent not normally mine--I found that I could draw nothing
but heads, nothing, in fact, but one head--always the same--the head
of a dark-skinned woman, with huge and terrible features and a very
drooping left eye; and so well drawn, too, that I was amazed, as you
may imagine----â€

â€œAnd the expression of the face----?â€

Pender hesitated a moment for words, casting about with his hands in
the air and hunching his shoulders. A perceptible shudder ran over him.

â€œWhat I can only describe as--_blackness_,â€ he replied in a low tone;
â€œthe face of a dark and evil soul.â€

â€œYou destroyed that, too?â€ queried the doctor sharply.

â€œNo; I have kept the drawings,â€ he said, with a laugh, and rose to get
them from a drawer in the writing-desk behind him.

â€œHere is all that remains of the pictures, you see,â€ he added, pushing
a number of loose sheets under the doctorâ€™s eyes; â€œnothing but a few
scrawly lines. Thatâ€™s all I found the next morning. I had really drawn
no heads at all--nothing but those lines and blots and wriggles. The
pictures were entirely subjective, and existed only in my mind which
constructed them out of a few wild strokes of the pen. Like the altered
scale of space and time it was a complete delusion. These all passed,
of course, with the passing of the drugâ€™s effects. But the other thing
did not pass. I mean, the presence of that Dark Soul remained with me.
It is here still. It is real. I donâ€™t know how I can escape from it.â€

â€œIt is attached to the house, not to you personally. You must leave the
house.â€

â€œYes. Only I cannot afford to leave the house, for my work is my sole
means of support, and--well, you see, since this change I cannot even
write. They are horrible, these mirthless tales I now write, with their
mockery of laughter, their diabolical suggestion. Horrible! I shall go
mad if this continues.â€

He screwed his face up and looked about the room as though he expected
to see some haunting shape.

â€œThe influence in this house, induced by my experiment, has killed in
a flash, in a sudden stroke, the sources of my humour, and, though I
still go on writing funny tales--I have a certain name, you know--my
inspiration has dried up, and much of what I write I have to burn--yes,
doctor, to burn, before any one sees it.â€

â€œAs utterly alien to your own mind and personality?â€

â€œUtterly! As though some one else had written it----â€

â€œAh!â€

â€œAnd shocking!â€ He passed his hand over his eyes a moment and let the
breath escape softly through his teeth. â€œYet most damnably clever in
the consummate way the vile suggestions are insinuated under cover of
a kind of high drollery. My stenographer left me, of course--and Iâ€™ve
been afraid to take another----â€

John Silence got up and began to walk about the room leisurely without
speaking; he appeared to be examining the pictures on the wall and
reading the names of the books lying about. Presently he paused on the
hearthrug, with his back to the fire, and turned to look his patient
quietly in the eyes. Penderâ€™s face was grey and drawn; the hunted
expression dominated it; the long recital had told upon him.

â€œThank you, Mr. Pender,â€ he said, a curious glow showing about his
fine, quiet face, â€œthank you for the sincerity and frankness of your
account. But I think now there is nothing further I need ask you.â€ He
indulged in a long scrutiny of the authorâ€™s haggard features, drawing
purposely the manâ€™s eyes to his own and then meeting them with a look
of power and confidence calculated to inspire even the feeblest soul
with courage. â€œAnd, to begin with,â€ he added, smiling pleasantly, â€œlet
me assure you without delay that you need have no alarm, for you are no
more insane or deluded than I myself am----â€

Pender heaved a deep sigh and tried to return the smile.

â€œ----and this is simply a case, so far as I can judge at present, of a
very singular psychical invasion, and a very sinister one, too, if you
perhaps understand what I mean----â€

â€œItâ€™s an odd expression; you used it before, you know,â€ said the
author wearily, yet eagerly listening to every word of the diagnosis,
and deeply touched by the intelligent sympathy which did not at once
indicate the lunatic asylum.

â€œPossibly,â€ returned the other, â€œand an odd affliction too, youâ€™ll
allow, yet one not unknown to the nations of antiquity, nor to those
moderns, perhaps, who recognise the freedom of action under certain
pathogenic conditions between this world and another.â€

â€œAnd you think,â€ asked Pender hastily, â€œthat it is all primarily due to
the _Cannabis_? There is nothing radically amiss with myself--nothing
incurable, or----?â€

â€œDue entirely to the overdose,â€ Dr. Silence replied emphatically, â€œto
the drugâ€™s direct action upon your psychical being. It rendered you
ultra-sensitive and made you respond to an increased rate of vibration.
And, let me tell you, Mr. Pender, that your experiment might have had
results far more dire. It has brought you into touch with a somewhat
singular class of Invisible, but of one, I think, chiefly human in
character. You might, however, just as easily have been drawn out of
human range altogether, and the results of such a contingency would
have been exceedingly terrible. Indeed, you would not now be here to
tell the tale. I need not alarm you on that score, but mention it as
a warning you will not misunderstand or underrate after what you have
been through.

â€œYou look puzzled. You do not quite gather what I am driving at; and
it is not to be expected that you should, for you, I suppose, are
the nominal Christian with the nominal Christianâ€™s lofty standard of
ethics, and his utter ignorance of spiritual possibilities. Beyond
a somewhat childish understanding of â€˜spiritual wickedness in high
places,â€™ you probably have no conception of what is possible once you
break down the slender gulf that is mercifully fixed between you and
that Outer World. But my studies and training have taken me far outside
these orthodox trips, and I have made experiments that I could scarcely
speak to you about in language that would be intelligible to you.â€

He paused a moment to note the breathless interest of Penderâ€™s face and
manner. Every word he uttered was calculated; he knew exactly the value
and effect of the emotions he desired to waken in the heart of the
afflicted being before him.

â€œAnd from certain knowledge I have gained through various experiences,â€
he continued calmly, â€œI can diagnose your case as I said before to be
one of psychical invasion.â€

â€œAnd the nature of this--er--invasion?â€ stammered the bewildered writer
of humorous tales.

â€œThere is no reason why I should not say at once that I do not yet
quite know,â€ replied Dr. Silence. â€œI may first have to make one or two
experiments----â€

â€œOn me?â€ gasped Pender, catching his breath.

â€œNot exactly,â€ the doctor said, with a grave smile, â€œbut with your
assistance, perhaps. I shall want to test the conditions of the
house--to ascertain, if possible, the character of the forces, of this
strange personality that has been haunting you----â€

â€œAt present you have no idea exactly who--what--why----â€ asked the
other in a wild flurry of interest, dread and amazement.

â€œI have a very good idea, but no proof rather,â€ returned the doctor.
â€œThe effects of the drug in altering the scale of time and space, and
merging the senses have nothing primarily to do with the invasion. They
come to any one who is fool enough to take an experimental dose. It is
the other features of your case that are unusual. You see, you are now
in touch with certain violent emotions, desires, purposes, still active
in this house, that were produced in the past by some powerful and evil
personality that lived here. How long ago, or why they still persist
so forcibly, I cannot positively say. But I should judge that they are
merely forces acting automatically with the momentum of their terrific
original impetus.â€

â€œNot directed by a living being, a conscious will, you mean?â€

â€œPossibly not--but none the less dangerous on that account, and more
difficult to deal with. I cannot explain to you in a few minutes the
nature of such things, for you have not made the studies that would
enable you to follow me; but I have reason to believe that on the
dissolution at death of a human being, its forces may still persist
and continue to act in a blind, unconscious fashion. As a rule they
speedily dissipate themselves, but in the case of a very powerful
personality they may last a long time. And, in some cases--of which I
incline to think this is one--these forces may coalesce with certain
non-human entities who thus continue their life indefinitely and
increase their strength to an unbelievable degree. If the original
personality was evil, the beings attracted to the left-over forces
will also be evil. In this case, I think there has been an unusual and
dreadful aggrandisement of the thoughts and purposes left behind long
ago by a woman of consummate wickedness and great personal power of
character and intellect. Now, do you begin to see what I am driving at
a little?â€

Pender stared fixedly at his companion, plain horror showing in his
eyes. But he found nothing to say, and the doctor continued--

â€œIn your case, predisposed by the action of the drug, you have
experienced the rush of these forces in undiluted strength. They
wholly obliterate in you the sense of humour, fancy, imagination,--all
that makes for cheerfulness and hope. They seek, though perhaps
automatically only, to oust your own thoughts and establish themselves
in their place. You are the victim of a psychical invasion. At the same
time, you have become clairvoyant in the true sense. You are also a
clairvoyant victim.â€

Pender mopped his face and sighed. He left his chair and went over to
the fireplace to warm himself.

â€œYou must think me a quack to talk like this, or a madman,â€ laughed
Dr. Silence. â€œBut never mind that. I have come to help you, and I can
help you if you will do what I tell you. It is very simple: you must
leave this house at once. Oh, never mind the difficulties; we will deal
with those together. I can place another house at your disposal, or
I would take the lease here off your hands, and later have it pulled
down. Your case interests me greatly, and I mean to see you through, so
that you have no anxiety, and can drop back into your old groove of
work to-morrow! The drug has provided you, and therefore me, with a
short-cut to a very interesting experience. I am grateful to you.â€

The author poked the fire vigorously, emotion rising in him like a
tide. He glanced towards the door nervously.

â€œThere is no need to alarm your wife or to tell her the details of
our conversation,â€ pursued the other quietly. â€œLet her know that you
will soon be in possession again of your sense of humour and your
health, and explain that I am lending you another house for six months.
Meanwhile I may have the right to use this house for a night or two for
my experiment. Is that understood between us?â€

â€œI can only thank you from the bottom of my heart,â€ stammered Pender,
unable to find words to express his gratitude.

Then he hesitated for a moment, searching the doctorâ€™s face anxiously.

â€œAnd your experiment with the house?â€ he said at length.

â€œOf the simplest character, my dear Mr. Pender. Although I am myself an
artificially trained psychic, and consequently aware of the presence
of discarnate entities as a rule, I have so far felt nothing here at
all. This makes me sure that the forces acting here are of an unusual
description. What I propose to do is to make an experiment with a view
of drawing out this evil, coaxing it from its lair, so to speak, in
order that it may _exhaust itself through me_ and become dissipated for
ever. I have already been inoculated,â€ he added; â€œI consider myself to
be immune.â€

â€œHeavens above!â€ gasped the author, collapsing on to a chair.

â€œHell beneath! might be a more appropriate exclamation,â€ the doctor
laughed. â€œBut, seriously, Mr. Pender, this is what I propose to
do--with your permission.â€

â€œOf course, of course,â€ cried the other, â€œyou have my permission and my
best wishes for success. I can see no possible objection, but----â€

â€œBut what?â€

â€œI pray to Heaven you will not undertake this experiment alone, will
you?â€

â€œOh dear, no; not alone.â€

â€œYou will take a companion with good nerves, and reliable in case of
disaster, wonâ€™t you?â€

â€œI shall bring two companions,â€ the doctor said.

â€œAh, thatâ€™s better. I feel easier. I am sure you must have among your
acquaintances men who----â€

â€œI shall not think of bringing men, Mr. Pender.â€

The other looked up sharply.

â€œNo, or women either; or children.â€

â€œI donâ€™t understand. Who will you bring, then?â€

â€œAnimals,â€ explained the doctor, unable to prevent a smile at his
companionâ€™s expression of surprise--â€œtwo animals, a cat and a dog.â€

Pender stared as if his eyes would drop out upon the floor, and then
led the way without another word into the adjoining room where his wife
was awaiting them for tea.


II

A few days later the humorist and his wife, with minds greatly
relieved, moved into a small furnished house placed at their free
disposal in another part of London; and John Silence, intent upon his
approaching experiment, made ready to spend a night in the empty house
on the top of Putney Hill. Only two rooms were prepared for occupation:
the study on the ground floor and the bedroom immediately above it;
all other doors were to be locked, and no servant was to be left in
the house. The motor had orders to call for him at nine oâ€™clock the
following morning.

And, meanwhile, his secretary had instructions to look up the past
history and associations of the place, and learn everything he could
concerning the character of former occupants, recent or remote.

The animals, by whose sensitiveness he intended to test any unusual
conditions in the atmosphere of the building, Dr. Silence selected
with care and judgment. He believed (and had already made curious
experiments to prove it) that animals were more often, and more truly,
clairvoyant than human beings. Many of them, he felt convinced,
possessed powers of perception far superior to that mere keenness of
the senses common to all dwellers in the wilds where the senses grow
specially alert; they had what he termed â€œanimal clairvoyance,â€ and
from his experiments with horses, dogs, cats, and even birds, he had
drawn certain deductions, which, however, need not be referred to in
detail here.

Cats, in particular, he believed, were almost continuously conscious of
a larger field of vision, too detailed even for a photographic camera,
and quite beyond the reach of normal human organs. He had, further,
observed that while dogs were usually terrified in the presence of such
phenomena, cats on the other hand were soothed and satisfied. They
welcomed manifestations as something belonging peculiarly to their own
region.

He selected his animals, therefore, with wisdom so that they might
afford a differing test, each in its own way, and that one should not
merely communicate its own excitement to the other. He took a dog and a
cat.

The cat he chose, now full grown, had lived with him since kittenhood,
a kittenhood of perplexing sweetness and audacious mischief. Wayward
it was and fanciful, ever playing its own mysterious games in the
corners of the room, jumping at invisible nothings, leaping sideways
into the air and falling with tiny mocassined feet on to another part
of the carpet, yet with an air of dignified earnestness which showed
that the performance was necessary to its own well-being, and not done
merely to impress a stupid human audience. In the middle of elaborate
washing it would look up, startled, as though to stare at the approach
of some Invisible, cocking its little head sideways and putting out a
velvet pad to inspect cautiously. Then it would get absent-minded, and
stare with equal intentness in another direction (just to confuse the
onlookers), and suddenly go on furiously washing its body again, but in
quite a new place. Except for a white patch on its breast it was coal
black. And its name was--Smoke.

â€œSmokeâ€ described its temperament as well as its appearance. Its
movements, its individuality, its posing as a little furry mass of
concealed mysteries, its elfin-like elusiveness, all combined to
justify its name; and a subtle painter might have pictured it as a
wisp of floating smoke, the fire below betraying itself at two points
only--the glowing eyes.

All its forces ran to intelligence--secret intelligence, the wordless,
incalculable intuition of the Cat. It was, indeed, _the_ cat for the
business in hand.

The selection of the dog was not so simple, for the doctor owned many;
but after much deliberation he chose a collie, called Flame from his
yellow coat. True, it was a trifle old, and stiff in the joints, and
even beginning to grow deaf, but, on the other hand, it was a very
particular friend of Smokeâ€™s, and had fathered it from kittenhood
upwards so that a subtle understanding existed between them. It was
this that turned the balance in its favour, this and its courage.
Moreover, though good-tempered, it was a terrible fighter, and its
anger when provoked by a righteous cause was a fury of fire, and
irresistible.

It had come to him quite young, straight from the shepherd, with the
air of the hills yet in its nostrils, and was then little more than
skin and bones and teeth. For a collie it was sturdily built, its nose
blunter than most, its yellow hair stiff rather than silky, and it had
full eyes, unlike the slit eyes of its breed. Only its master could
touch it, for it ignored strangers, and despised their pattings--when
any dared to pat it. There was something patriarchal about the old
beast. He was in earnest, and went through life with tremendous
energy and big things in view, as though he had the reputation of his
whole race to uphold. And to watch him fighting against odds was to
understand why he was terrible.

In his relations with Smoke he was always absurdly gentle; also he
was fatherly; and at the same time betrayed a certain diffidence or
shyness. He recognised that Smoke called for strong yet respectful
management. The catâ€™s circuitous methods puzzled him, and his elaborate
pretences perhaps shocked the dogâ€™s liking for direct, undisguised
action. Yet, while he failed to comprehend these tortuous feline
mysteries, he was never contemptuous or condescending; and he presided
over the safety of his furry black friend somewhat as a father,
loving but intuitive, might superintend the vagaries of a wayward and
talented child. And, in return, Smoke rewarded him with exhibitions of
fascinating and audacious mischief.

And these brief descriptions of their characters are necessary for the
proper understanding of what subsequently took place.

With Smoke sleeping in the folds of his fur coat, and the collie lying
watchful on the seat opposite, John Silence went down in his motor
after dinner on the night of November 15th.

And the fog was so dense that they were obliged to travel at quarter
speed the entire way.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was after ten oâ€™clock when he dismissed the motor and entered the
dingy little house with the latchkey provided by Pender. He found the
hall gas turned low, and a fire in the study. Books and food had also
been placed ready by the servant according to instructions. Coils of
fog rushed in after him through the opened door and filled the hall and
passage with its cold discomfort.

The first thing Dr. Silence did was to lock up Smoke in the study with
a saucer of milk before the fire, and then make a search of the house
with Flame. The dog ran cheerfully behind him all the way while he
tried the doors of the other rooms to make sure they were locked. He
nosed about into corners and made little excursions on his own account.
His manner was expectant. He knew there must be something unusual about
the proceeding, because it was contrary to the habits of his whole
life not to be asleep at this hour on the mat in front of the fire. He
kept looking up into his masterâ€™s face, as door after door was tried,
with an expression of intelligent sympathy, but at the same time a
certain air of disapproval. Yet everything his master did was good in
his eyes, and he betrayed as little impatience as possible with all
this unnecessary journeying to and fro. If the doctor was pleased to
play this sort of game at such an hour of the night, it was surely not
for him to object. So he played it too; and was very busy and earnest
about it into the bargain.

After an uneventful search they came down again to the study, and here
Dr. Silence discovered Smoke washing his face calmly in front of the
fire. The saucer of milk was licked dry and clean; the preliminary
examination that cats always make in new surroundings had evidently
been satisfactorily concluded. He drew an arm-chair up to the fire,
stirred the coals into a blaze, arranged the table and lamp to his
satisfaction for reading, and then prepared surreptitiously to watch
the animals. He wished to observe them carefully without their being
aware of it.

Now, in spite of their respective ages, it was the regular custom of
these two to play together every night before sleep. Smoke always made
the advances, beginning with grave impudence to pat the dogâ€™s tail, and
Flame played cumbrously, with condescension. It was his duty, rather
than pleasure; he was glad when it was over, and sometimes he was very
determined and refused to play at all.

And this night was one of the occasions on which he was firm.

The doctor, looking cautiously over the top of his book, watched
the cat begin the performance. It started by gazing with an innocent
expression at the dog where he lay with nose on paws and eyes wide open
in the middle of the floor. Then it got up and made as though it meant
to walk to the door, going deliberately and very softly. Flameâ€™s eyes
followed it until it was beyond the range of sight, and then the cat
turned sharply and began patting his tail tentatively with one paw.
The tail moved slightly in reply, and Smoke changed paws and tapped
it again. The dog, however, did not rise to play as was his wont, and
the cat fell to patting it briskly with both paws. Flame still lay
motionless.

This puzzled and bored the cat, and it went round and stared hard into
its friendâ€™s face to see what was the matter. Perhaps some inarticulate
message flashed from the dogâ€™s eyes into its own little brain, making
it understand that the programme for the night had better not begin
with play. Perhaps it only realised that its friend was immovable. But,
whatever the reason, its usual persistence thenceforward deserted it,
and it made no further attempts at persuasion. Smoke yielded at once to
the dogâ€™s mood; it sat down where it was and began to wash.

But the washing, the doctor noted, was by no means its real purpose;
it only used it to mask something else; it stopped at the most busy
and furious moments and began to stare about the room. Its thoughts
wandered absurdly. It peered intently at the curtains; at the shadowy
corners; at empty space above; leaving its body in curiously awkward
positions for whole minutes together. Then it turned sharply and stared
with a sudden signal of intelligence at the dog, and Flame at once
rose somewhat stiffly to his feet and began to wander aimlessly and
restlessly to and fro about the floor. Smoke followed him, padding
quietly at his heels. Between them they made what seemed to be a
deliberate search of the room.

And, here, as he watched them, noting carefully every detail of
the performance over the top of his book, yet making no effort to
interfere, it seemed to the doctor that the first beginnings of a
faint distress betrayed themselves in the collie, and in the cat the
stirrings of a vague excitement.

He observed them closely. The fog was thick in the air, and the
tobacco smoke from his pipe added to its density; the furniture at the
far end stood mistily, and where the shadows congregated in hanging
clouds under the ceiling, it was difficult to see clearly at all; the
lamplight only reached to a level of five feet from the floor, above
which came layers of comparative darkness, so that the room appeared
twice as lofty as it actually was. By means of the lamp and the fire,
however, the carpet was everywhere clearly visible.

The animals made their silent tour of the floor, sometimes the dog
leading, sometimes the cat; occasionally they looked at one another
as though exchanging signals; and once or twice, in spite of the
limited space, he lost sight of one or other among the fog and the
shadows. Their curiosity, it appeared to him, was something more than
the excitement lurking in the unknown territory of a strange room;
yet, so far, it was impossible to test this, and he purposely kept his
mind quietly receptive lest the smallest mental excitement on his part
should communicate itself to the animals and thus destroy the value of
their independent behaviour.

They made a very thorough journey, leaving no piece of furniture
unexamined, or unsmelt. Flame led the way, walking slowly with lowered
head, and Smoke followed demurely at his heels, making a transparent
pretence of not being interested, yet missing nothing. And, at length,
they returned, the old collie first, and came to rest on the mat
before the fire. Flame rested his muzzle on his masterâ€™s knee, smiling
beatifically while he patted the yellow head and spoke his name; and
Smoke, coming a little later, pretending he came by chance, looked from
the empty saucer to his face, lapped up the milk when it was given him
to the last drop, and then sprang upon his knees and curled round for
the sleep it had fully earned and intended to enjoy.

Silence descended upon the room. Only the breathing of the dog upon the
mat came through the deep stillness, like the pulse of time marking
the minutes; and the steady drip, drip of the fog outside upon the
window-ledges dismally testified to the inclemency of the night beyond.
And the soft crashings of the coals as the fire settled down into the
grate became less and less audible as the fire sank and the flames
resigned their fierceness.

It was now well after eleven oâ€™clock, and Dr. Silence devoted himself
again to his book. He read the words on the printed page and took
in their meaning superficially, yet without starting into life
the correlations of thought and suggestion that should accompany
interesting reading. Underneath, all the while, his mental energies
were absorbed in watching, listening, waiting for what might come.
He was not over sanguine himself, yet he did not wish to be taken
by surprise. Moreover, the animals, his sensitive barometers, had
incontinently gone to sleep.

After reading a dozen pages, however, he realised that his mind was
really occupied in reviewing the features of Penderâ€™s extraordinary
story, and that it was no longer necessary to steady his imagination
by studying the dull paragraphs detailed in the pages before him. He
laid down his book accordingly, and allowed his thoughts to dwell upon
the features of the Case. Speculations as to the meaning, however, he
rigorously suppressed, knowing that such thoughts would act upon his
imagination like wind upon the glowing embers of a fire.

As the night wore on the silence grew deeper and deeper, and only
at rare intervals he heard the sound of wheels on the main road a
hundred yards away, where the horses went at a walking pace owing to
the density of the fog. The echo of pedestrian footsteps no longer
reached him, the clamour of occasional voices no longer came down the
side street The night, muffled by fog, shrouded by veils of ultimate
mystery, hung about the haunted villa like a doom. Nothing in the house
stirred. Stillness, in a thick blanket, lay over the upper storeys.
Only the mist in the room grew more dense, he thought, and the damp
cold more penetrating. Certainly, from time to time, he shivered.

The collie, now deep in slumber, moved occasionally,--grunted, sighed,
or twitched his legs in dreams. Smoke lay on his knees, a pool of warm,
black fur, only the closest observation detecting the movement of his
sleek sides. It was difficult to distinguish exactly where his head and
body joined in that circle of glistening hair; only a black satin nose
and a tiny tip of pink tongue betrayed the secret.

Dr. Silence watched him, and felt comfortable. The collieâ€™s breathing
was soothing. The fire was well built, and would burn for another two
hours without attention. He was not conscious of the least nervousness.
He particularly wished to remain in his ordinary and normal state of
mind, and to force nothing. If sleep came naturally, he would let it
come--and even welcome it. The coldness of the room, when the fire
died down later, would be sure to wake him again; and it would then be
time enough to carry these sleeping barometers up to bed. From various
psychic premonitions he knew quite well that the night would not pass
without adventure; but he did not wish to force its arrival; and he
wished to remain normal, and let the animals remain normal, so that,
when it came, it would be unattended by excitement or by any straining
of the attention. Many experiments had made him wise. And, for the
rest, he had no fear.

Accordingly, after a time, he did fall asleep as he had expected, and
the last thing he remembered, before oblivion slipped up over his eyes
like soft wool, was the picture of Flame stretching all four legs at
once, and sighing noisily as he sought a more comfortable position for
his paws and muzzle upon the mat.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a good deal later when he became aware that a weight lay upon
his chest, and that something was pencilling over his face and mouth. A
soft touch on the cheek woke him. Something was patting him.

He sat up with a jerk, and found himself staring straight into a pair
of brilliant eyes, half green, half black. Smokeâ€™s face lay level with
his own; and the cat had climbed up with its front paws upon his chest.

The lamp had burned low and the fire was nearly out, yet Dr. Silence
saw in a moment that the cat was in an excited state. It kneaded with
its front paws into his chest, shifting from one to the other. He felt
them prodding against him. It lifted a leg very carefully and patted
his cheek gingerly. Its fur, he saw, was standing ridgewise upon its
back; the ears were flattened back somewhat; the tail was switching
sharply. The cat, of course, had wakened him with a purpose, and the
instant he realised this, he set it upon the arm of the chair and
sprang up with a quick turn to face the empty room behind him. By some
curious instinct, his arms of their own accord assumed an attitude
of defence in front of him, as though to ward off something that
threatened his safety. Yet nothing was visible. Only shapes of fog hung
about rather heavily in the air, moving slightly to and fro.

His mind was now fully alert, and the last vestiges of sleep gone. He
turned the lamp higher and peered about him. Two things he became aware
of at once: one, that Smoke, while excited, was _pleasurably_ excited;
the other, that the collie was no longer visible upon the mat at his
feet. He had crept away to the corner of the wall farthest from the
window, and lay watching the room with wide-open eyes, in which lurked
plainly something of alarm.

Something in the dogâ€™s behaviour instantly struck Dr. Silence as
unusual, and, calling him by name, he moved across to pat him. Flame
got up, wagged his tail, and came over slowly to the rug, uttering a
low sound that was half growl, half whine. He was evidently perturbed
about something, and his master was proceeding to administer comfort
when his attention was suddenly drawn to the antics of his other
four-footed companion, the cat.

And what he saw filled him with something like amazement.

Smoke had jumped down from the back of the arm-chair and now occupied
the middle of the carpet, where, with tail erect and legs stiff as
ramrods, it was steadily pacing backwards and forwards in a narrow
space, uttering, as it did so, those curious little guttural sounds of
pleasure that only an animal of the feline species knows how to make
expressive of supreme happiness. Its stiffened legs and arched back
made it appear larger than usual, and the black visage wore a smile of
beatific joy. Its eyes blazed magnificently; it was in an ecstasy.

At the end of every few paces it turned sharply and stalked back again
along the same line, padding softly, and purring like a roll of little
muffled drums. It behaved precisely as though it were rubbing against
the ankles of some one who remained invisible. A thrill ran down the
doctorâ€™s spine as he stood and stared. His experiment was growing
interesting at last.

He called the collieâ€™s attention to his friendâ€™s performance to see
whether he too was aware of anything standing there upon the carpet;
and the dogâ€™s behaviour was significant and corroborative. He came
as far as his masterâ€™s knees and then stopped dead, refusing to
investigate closely. In vain Dr. Silence urged him; he wagged his
tail, whined a little, and stood in a half-crouching attitude, staring
alternately at the cat and at his masterâ€™s face. He was, apparently,
both puzzled and alarmed, and the whine went deeper and deeper down
into his throat till it changed into an ugly snarl of awakening anger.

Then the doctor called to him in a tone of command he had never known
to be disregarded; but still the dog, though springing up in response,
declined to move nearer. He made tentative motions, pranced a little
like a dog about to take to water, pretended to bark, and ran to and
fro on the carpet. So far there was no actual fear in his manner, but
he was uneasy and anxious, and nothing would induce him to go within
touching distance of the walking cat. Once he made a complete circuit,
but always carefully out of reach; and in the end he returned to his
masterâ€™s legs and rubbed vigorously against him. Flame did not like the
performance at all: that much was quite clear.

For several minutes John Silence watched the performance of the cat
with profound attention and without interfering. Then he called to the
animal by name.

â€œSmoke, you mysterious beastie, what in the world are you about?â€ he
said, in a coaxing tone.

The cat looked up at him for a moment, smiling in its ecstasy, blinking
its eyes, but too happy to pause. He spoke to it again. He called to it
several times, and each time it turned upon him its blazing eyes, drunk
with inner delight, opening and shutting its lips, its body large and
rigid with excitement. Yet it never for one instant paused in its short
journeys to and fro.

He noted exactly what it did: it walked, he saw, the same number of
paces each time, some six or seven steps, and then it turned sharply
and retraced them. By the pattern of the great roses in the carpet
he measured it. It kept to the same direction and the same line. It
behaved precisely as though it were rubbing against something solid.
Undoubtedly, there was something standing there on that strip of
carpet, something invisible to the doctor, something that alarmed the
dog, yet caused the cat unspeakable pleasure.

â€œSmokie!â€ he called again, â€œSmokie, you black mystery, what is it
excites you so?â€

Again the cat looked up at him for a brief second, and then continued
its sentry-walk, blissfully happy, intensely preoccupied. And, for an
instant, as he watched it, the doctor was aware that a faint uneasiness
stirred in the depths of his own being, focusing itself for the moment
upon this curious behaviour of the uncanny creature before him.

There rose in him quite a new realisation of the mystery connected
with the whole feline tribe, but especially with that common member
of it, the domestic cat--their hidden lives, their strange aloofness,
their incalculable subtlety. How utterly remote from anything that
human beings understood lay the sources of their elusive activities.
As he watched the indescribable bearing of the little creature mincing
along the strip of carpet under his eyes, coquetting with the powers
of darkness, welcoming, maybe, some fearsome visitor, there stirred in
his heart a feeling strangely akin to awe. Its indifference to human
kind, its serene superiority to the obvious, struck him forcibly with
fresh meaning; so remote, so inaccessible seemed the secret purposes of
its real life, so alien to the blundering honesty of other animals.
Its absolute poise of bearing brought into his mind the opium-eaterâ€™s
words that â€œno dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally
itself with the mysteriousâ€; and he became suddenly aware that the
presence of the dog in this foggy, haunted room on the top of Putney
Hill was uncommonly welcome to him. He was glad to feel that Flameâ€™s
dependable personality was with him. The savage growling at his heels
was a pleasant sound. He was glad to hear it. That marching cat made
him uneasy.

Finding that Smoke paid no further attention to his words, the doctor
decided upon action. Would it rub against his leg, too? He would take
it by surprise and see.

He stepped quickly forward and placed himself upon the exact strip of
carpet where it walked.

But no cat is ever taken by surprise! The moment he occupied the space
of the Intruder, setting his feet on the woven roses midway in the line
of travel, Smoke suddenly stopped purring and sat down. It lifted up
its face with the most innocent stare imaginable of its green eyes. He
could have sworn it laughed. It was a perfect child again. In a single
second it had resumed its simple, domestic manner; and it gazed at him
in such a way that he almost felt Smoke was the normal being, and _his_
was the eccentric behaviour that was being watched. It was consummate,
the manner in which it brought about this change so easily and so
quickly.

â€œSuperb little actor!â€ he laughed in spite of himself, and stooped to
stroke the shining black back. But, in a flash, as he touched its fur,
the cat turned and spat at him viciously, striking at his hand with
one paw. Then, with a hurried scutter of feet, it shot like a shadow
across the floor and a moment later was calmly sitting over by the
window-curtains washing its face as though nothing interested it in the
whole world but the cleanness of its cheeks and whiskers.

John Silence straightened himself up and drew a long breath. He
realised that the performance was temporarily at an end. The
collie, meanwhile, who had watched the whole proceeding with marked
disapproval, had now lain down again upon the mat by the fire, no
longer growling. It seemed to the doctor just as though something that
had entered the room while he slept, alarming the dog, yet bringing
happiness to the cat, had now gone out again, leaving all as it was
before. Whatever it was that excited its blissful attentions had
retreated for the moment.

He realised this intuitively. Smoke evidently realised it, too, for
presently he deigned to march back to the fireplace and jump upon his
masterâ€™s knees. Dr. Silence, patient and determined, settled down once
more to his book. The animals soon slept; the fire blazed cheerfully;
and the cold fog from outside poured into the room through every
available chink and cranny.

For a long time silence and peace reigned in the room and Dr. Silence
availed himself of the quietness to make careful notes of what had
happened. He entered for future use in other cases an exhaustive
analysis of what he had observed, especially with regard to the
effect upon the two animals. It is impossible here, nor would it be
intelligible to the reader unversed in the knowledge of the region
known to a scientifically trained psychic like Dr. Silence, to
detail these observations. But to him it was clear, up to a certain
point--and for the rest he must still wait and watch. So far, at least,
he realised that while he slept in the chair--that is, while his will
was dormant--the room had suffered intrusion from what he recognised
as an intensely active Force, and might later be forced to acknowledge
as something more than merely a blind force, namely, a distinct
personality.

So far it had affected himself scarcely at all, but had acted directly
upon the simpler organisms of the animals. It stimulated keenly the
centres of the catâ€™s psychic being, inducing a state of instant
happiness (intensifying its consciousness probably in the same way
a drug or stimulant intensifies that of a human being); whereas it
alarmed the less sensitive dog, causing it to feel a vague apprehension
and distress.

His own sudden action and exhibition of energy had served to disperse
it temporarily, yet he felt convinced--the indications were not lacking
even while he sat there making notes--that it still remained near to
him, conditionally if not spatially, and was, as it were, gathering
force for a second attack.

And, further, he intuitively understood that the relations between the
two animals had undergone a subtle change: that the cat had become
immeasurably superior, confident, sure of itself in its own peculiar
region, whereas Flame had been weakened by an attack he could not
comprehend and knew not how to reply to. Though not yet afraid, he was
defiant--ready to act against a fear that he felt to be approaching. He
was no longer fatherly and protective towards the cat. Smoke held the
key to the situation; and both he and the cat knew it.

Thus, as the minutes passed, John Silence sat and waited, keenly on
the alert, wondering how soon the attack would be renewed, and at what
point it would be diverted from the animals and directed upon himself.

The book lay on the floor beside him, his notes were complete. With one
hand on the catâ€™s fur, and the dogâ€™s front paws resting against his
feet, the three of them dozed comfortably before the hot fire while the
night wore on and the silence deepened towards midnight.

It was well after one oâ€™clock in the morning when Dr. Silence turned
the lamp out and lighted the candle preparatory to going up to bed.
Then Smoke suddenly woke with a loud sharp purr and sat up. It neither
stretched, washed nor turned: it listened. And the doctor, watching it,
realised that a certain indefinable change had come about that very
moment in the room. A swift readjustment of the forces within the four
walls had taken place--a new disposition of their personal equations.
The balance was destroyed, the former harmony gone. Smoke, most
sensitive of barometers, had been the first to feel it, but the dog was
not slow to follow suit, for on looking down he noted that Flame was no
longer asleep. He was lying with eyes wide open, and that same instant
he sat up on his great haunches and began to growl.

Dr. Silence was in the act of taking the matches to re-light the lamp
when an audible movement in the room behind made him pause. Smoke
leaped down from his knee and moved forward a few paces across the
carpet. Then it stopped and stared fixedly; and the doctor stood up on
the rug to watch.

As he rose the sound was repeated, and he discovered that it was not
in the room as he first thought, but outside, and that it came from
more directions than one. There was a rushing, sweeping noise against
the window-panes, and simultaneously a sound of something brushing
against the door--out in the hall. Smoke advanced sedately across the
carpet, twitching his tail, and sat down within a foot of the door. The
influence that had destroyed the harmonious conditions of the room had
apparently moved in advance of its cause. Clearly, something was about
to happen.

For the first time that night John Silence hesitated; the thought of
that dark narrow hall-way, choked with fog, and destitute of human
comfort, was unpleasant. He became aware of a faint creeping of his
flesh. He knew, of course, that the actual opening of the door was not
necessary to the invasion of the room that was about to take place,
since neither doors nor windows, nor any other solid barriers could
interpose an obstacle to what was seeking entrance. Yet the opening of
the door would be significant and symbolic, and he distinctly shrank
from it.

But for a moment only. Smoke, turning with a show of impatience,
recalled him to his purpose, and he moved past the sitting, watching
creature, and deliberately opened the door to its full width.

What subsequently happened, happened in the feeble and flickering light
of the solitary candle on the mantelpiece.

Through the opened door he saw the hall, dimly lit and thick with fog.
Nothing, of course, was visible--nothing but the hat-stand, the African
spears in dark lines upon the wall and the high-backed wooden chair
standing grotesquely underneath on the oilcloth floor. For one instant
the fog seemed to move and thicken oddly; but he set that down to the
score of the imagination. The door had opened upon nothing.

Yet Smoke apparently thought otherwise, and the deep growling of the
collie from the mat at the back of the room seemed to confirm his
judgment.

For, proud and self-possessed, the cat had again risen to his feet,
and having advanced to the door, was now ushering some one slowly into
the room. Nothing could have been more evident. He paced from side to
side, bowing his little head with great _empressement_ and holding his
stiffened tail aloft like a flagstaff. He turned this way and that,
mincing to and fro, and showing signs of supreme satisfaction. He was
in his element. He welcomed the intrusion, and apparently reckoned that
his companions, the doctor and the dog, would welcome it likewise.

The Intruder had returned for a second attack.

Dr. Silence moved slowly backwards and took up his position on the
hearthrug, keying himself up to a condition of concentrated attention.

He noted that Flame stood beside him, facing the room, with body
motionless, and head moving swiftly from side to side with a curious
swaying movement. His eyes were wide open, his back rigid, his neck and
jaws thrust forward, his legs tense and ready to leap. Savage, ready
for attack or defence, yet dreadfully puzzled and perhaps already a
little cowed, he stood and stared, the hair on his spine and sides
positively bristling outwards as though a wind played through them. In
the dim firelight he looked like a great yellow-haired wolf, silent,
eyes shooting dark fire, exceedingly formidable. It was Flame, the
terrible.

Smoke, meanwhile, advanced from the door towards the middle of the
room, adopting the very slow pace of an invisible companion. A few
feet away it stopped and began to smile and blink its eyes. There
was something deliberately coaxing in its attitude as it stood there
undecided on the carpet, clearly wishing to effect some sort of
introduction between the Intruder and its canine friend and ally.
It assumed its most winning manners, purring, smiling, looking
persuasively from one to the other, and making quick tentative steps
first in one direction and then in the other. There had always existed
such perfect understanding between them in everything. Surely Flame
would appreciate Smokeâ€™s intentions now, and acquiesce.

But the old collie made no advances. He bared his teeth, lifting
his lips till the gums showed, and stood stockstill with fixed eyes
and heaving sides. The doctor moved a little farther back, watching
intently the smallest movement, and it was just then he divined
suddenly from the catâ€™s behaviour and attitude that it was not only a
single companion it had ushered into the room, but _several_. It kept
crossing over from one to the other, looking up at each in turn. It
sought to win over the dog to friendliness with them all. The original
Intruder had come back with reinforcements. And at the same time he
further realised that the Intruder was something more than a blindly
acting force, impersonal though destructive. It was a Personality, and
moreover a great personality. And it was accompanied for the purposes
of assistance by a host of other personalities, minor in degree, but
similar in kind.

He braced himself in the corner against the mantelpiece and waited,
his whole being roused to defence, for he was now fully aware that
the attack had spread to include himself as well as the animals,
and he must be on the alert. He strained his eyes through the foggy
atmosphere, trying in vain to see what the cat and dog saw; but the
candlelight threw an uncertain and flickering light across the room and
his eyes discerned nothing. On the floor Smoke moved softly in front of
him like a black shadow, his eyes gleaming as he turned his head, still
trying with many insinuating gestures and much purring to bring about
the introductions he desired.

But it was all in vain. Flame stood riveted to one spot, motionless as
a figure carved in stone.

Some minutes passed, during which only the cat moved, and then there
came a sharp change. Flame began to back towards the wall. He moved
his head from side to side as he went, sometimes turning to snap at
something almost behind him. _They_ were advancing upon him, trying to
surround him. His distress became very marked from now onwards, and
it seemed to the doctor that his anger merged into genuine terror and
became overwhelmed by it. The savage growl sounded perilously like a
whine, and more than once he tried to dive past his masterâ€™s legs, as
though hunting for a way of escape. He was trying to avoid something
that everywhere blocked the way.

This terror of the indomitable fighter impressed the doctor enormously;
yet also painfully; stirring his impatience; for he had never before
seen the dog show signs of giving in, and it distressed him to witness
it. He knew, however, that he was not giving in easily, and understood
that it was really impossible for him to gauge the animalâ€™s sensations
properly at all. What Flame felt, and saw, must be terrible indeed to
turn him all at once into a coward. He faced something that made him
afraid of more than his life merely. The doctor spoke a few quick words
of encouragement to him, and stroked the bristling hair. But without
much success. The collie seemed already beyond the reach of comfort
such as that, and the collapse of the old dog followed indeed very
speedily after this.

And Smoke, meanwhile, remained behind, watching the advance, but not
joining in it; sitting, pleased and expectant, considering that all
was going well and as it wished. It was kneading on the carpet with
its front paws--slowly, laboriously, as though its feet were dipped in
treacle. The sound its claws made as they caught in the threads was
distinctly audible. It was still smiling, blinking, purring.

Suddenly the collie uttered a poignant short bark and leaped heavily to
one side. His bared teeth traced a line of whiteness through the gloom.
The next instant he dashed past his masterâ€™s legs, almost upsetting his
balance, and shot out into the room, where he went blundering wildly
against walls and furniture. But that bark was significant; the doctor
had heard it before and knew what it meant: for it was the cry of the
fighter against odds and it meant that the old beast had found his
courage again. Possibly it was only the courage of despair, but at any
rate the fighting would be terrific. And Dr. Silence understood, too,
that he dared not interfere. Flame must fight his own enemies in his
own way.

But the cat, too, had heard that dreadful bark; and it, too, had
understood. This was more than it had bargained for. Across the dim
shadows of that haunted room there must have passed some secret signal
of distress between the animals. Smoke stood up and looked swiftly
about him. He uttered a piteous meow and trotted smartly away into the
greater darkness by the windows. What his object was only those endowed
with the spirit-like intelligence of cats might know. But, at any rate,
he had at last ranged himself on the side of his friend. And the little
beast meant business.

At the same moment the collie managed to gain the door. The doctor saw
him rush through into the hall like a flash of yellow light. He shot
across the oilcloth, and tore up the stairs, but in another second he
appeared again, flying down the steps and landing at the bottom in a
tumbling heap, whining, cringing, terrified. The doctor saw him slink
back into the room again and crawl round by the wall towards the cat.
Was, then, even the staircase occupied? Did _They_ stand also in the
hall? Was the whole house crowded from floor to ceiling?

The thought came to add to the keen distress he felt at the sight of
the collieâ€™s discomfiture. And, indeed, his own personal distress had
increased in a marked degree during the past minutes, and continued
to increase steadily to the climax. He recognised that the drain on
his own vitality grew steadily, and that the attack was now directed
against himself even more than against the defeated dog, and the too
much deceived cat.

It all seemed so rapid and uncalculated after that--the events that
took place in this little modern room at the top of Putney Hill between
midnight and sunrise--that Dr. Silence was hardly able to follow and
remember it all. It came about with such uncanny swiftness and terror;
the light was so uncertain; the movements of the black cat so difficult
to follow on the dark carpet, and the doctor himself so weary and taken
by surprise--that he found it almost impossible to observe accurately,
or to recall afterwards precisely what it was he had seen or in what
order the incidents had taken place. He never could understand what
defect of vision on his part made it seem as though the cat had
duplicated itself at first, and then increased indefinitely, so that
there were at least a dozen of them darting silently about the floor,
leaping softly on to chairs and tables, passing like shadows from the
open door to the end of the room, all black as sin, with brilliant
green eyes flashing fire in all directions. It was like the reflections
from a score of mirrors placed round the walls at different angles.
Nor could he make out at the time why the size of the room seemed to
have altered, grown much larger, and why it extended away behind him
where ordinarily the wall should have been. The snarling of the enraged
and terrified collie sounded sometimes so far away; the ceiling seemed
to have raised itself so much higher than before, and much of the
furniture had changed in appearance and shifted marvellously.

It was all so confused and confusing, as though the little room he knew
had become merged and transformed into the dimensions of quite another
chamber, that came to him, with its host of cats and its strange
distances, in a sort of vision.

But these changes came about a little later, and at a time when his
attention was so concentrated upon the proceedings of Smoke and the
collie, that he only observed them, as it were, subconsciously. And the
excitement, the flickering candlelight, the distress he felt for the
collie, and the distorting atmosphere of fog were the poorest possible
allies to careful observation.

At first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short
dangerous bark from time to time, snapping viciously at the empty
air, a foot or so from the ground. Once, indeed, he sprang upwards
and forwards, working furiously with teeth and paws, and with a noise
like wolves fighting, but only to dash back the next minute against
the wall behind him. Then, after lying still for a bit, he rose to a
crouching position as though to spring again, snarling horribly and
making short half-circles with lowered head. And Smoke all the while
meowed piteously by the window as though trying to draw the attack upon
himself.

Then it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business seemed to turn
aside from the dog and direct itself upon his own person. The collie
had made another spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner,
where he made noise enough in his savage rage to waken the dead before
he fell to whining and then finally lay still. And directly afterwards
the doctorâ€™s own distress became intolerably acute. He had made a half
movement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that was denser
than mere fog seemed to drop down over the scene, draping room, walls,
animals and fire in a mist of darkness and folding also about his own
mind. Other forms moved silently across the field of vision, forms
that he recognised from previous experiments, and welcomed not. Unholy
thoughts began to crowd into his brain, sinister suggestions of evil
presented themselves seductively. Ice seemed to settle about his heart,
and his mind trembled. He began to lose memory--memory of his identity,
of where he was, of what he ought to do. The very foundations of his
strength were shaken. His will seemed paralysed.

And it was then that the room filled with this horde of cats, all dark
as the night, all silent, all with lamping eyes of green fire. The
dimensions of the place altered and shifted. He was in a much larger
space. The whining of the dog sounded far away, and all about him the
cats flew busily to and fro, silently playing their tearing, rushing
game of evil, weaving the pattern of their dark purpose upon the floor.
He strove hard to collect himself and remember the words of power he
had made use of before in similar dread positions where his dangerous
practice had sometimes led; but he could recall nothing consecutively;
a mist lay over his mind and memory; he felt dazed and his forces
scattered. The deeps within were too troubled for healing power to come
out of them.

It was glamour, of course, he realised afterwards, the strong glamour
thrown upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the
veil; but at the time he was not sufficiently aware of this and, as
with all true glamour, was unable to grasp where the true ended and
the false began. He was caught momentarily in the same vortex that
had sought to lure the cat to destruction through its delight, and
threatened utterly to overwhelm the dog through its terror.

There came a sound in the chimney behind him like wind booming and
tearing its way down. The windows rattled. The candle flickered and
went out. The glacial atmosphere closed round him with the cold of
death, and a great rushing sound swept by overhead as though the
ceiling had lifted to a great height. He heard the door shut. Far
away it sounded. He felt lost, shelterless in the depths of his soul.
Yet still he held out and resisted while the climax of the fight came
nearer and nearer.... He had stepped into the stream of forces awakened
by Pender and he knew that he must withstand them to the end or come to
a conclusion that it was not good for a man to come to. Something from
the region of utter cold was upon him.

And then quite suddenly, through the confused mists about him, there
slowly rose up the Personality that had been all the time directing
the battle. Some force entered his being that shook him as the
tempest shakes a leaf, and close against his eyes--clean level with
his face--he found himself staring into the wreck of a vast dark
Countenance, a countenance that was terrible even in its ruin.

For ruined it was, and terrible it was, and the mark of spiritual
evil was branded everywhere upon its broken features. Eyes, face and
hair rose level with his own, and for a space of time he never could
properly measure, or determine, these two, a man and a woman, looked
straight into each otherâ€™s visages and down into each otherâ€™s hearts.

And John Silence, the soul with the good, unselfish motive, held his
own against the dark discarnate woman whose motive was pure evil, and
whose soul was on the side of the Dark Powers.

It was the climax that touched the depth of power within him and began
to restore him slowly to his own. He was conscious, of course, of
effort, and yet it seemed no superhuman one, for he had recognised the
character of his opponentâ€™s power, and he called upon the good within
him to meet and overcome it. The inner forces stirred and trembled
in response to his call. They did not at first come readily as was
their habit, for under the spell of glamour they had already been
diabolically lulled into inactivity, but come they eventually did,
rising out of the inner spiritual nature he had learned with so much
time and pain to awaken to life. And power and confidence came with
them. He began to breathe deeply and regularly, and at the same time
to absorb into himself the forces opposed to him, and to _turn them to
his own account_. By ceasing to resist, and allowing the deadly stream
to pour into him unopposed, he used the very power supplied by his
adversary and thus enormously increased his own.

For this spiritual alchemy he had learned. He understood that force
ultimately is everywhere one and the same; it is the motive behind
that makes it good or evil; and his motive was entirely unselfish. He
knew--provided he was not first robbed of self-control--how vicariously
to absorb these evil radiations into himself and change them magically
into his own good purposes. And, since his motive was pure and his soul
fearless, they could not work him harm.

Thus he stood in the main stream of evil unwittingly attracted by
Pender, deflecting its course upon himself; and after passing through
the purifying filter of his own unselfishness these energies could only
add to his store of experience, of knowledge, and therefore of power.
And, as his self-control returned to him, he gradually accomplished
this purpose, even though trembling while he did so.

Yet the struggle was severe, and in spite of the freezing chill of the
air, the perspiration poured down his face. Then, by slow degrees, the
dark and dreadful countenance faded, the glamour passed from his soul,
the normal proportions returned to walls and ceiling, the forms melted
back into the fog, and the whirl of rushing shadow-cats disappeared
whence they came.

And with the return of the consciousness of his own identity John
Silence was restored to the full control of his own will-power. In a
deep, modulated voice he began to utter certain rhythmical sounds that
slowly rolled through the air like a rising sea, filling the room with
powerful vibratory activities that whelmed all irregularities of lesser
vibrations in its own swelling tone. He made certain sigils, gestures
and movements at the same time. For several minutes he continued to
utter these words, until at length the growing volume dominated the
whole room and mastered the manifestation of all that opposed it. For
just as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil
forces by raising them into higher channels, so he knew from long study
the occult use of sound, and its direct effect upon the plastic region
wherein the powers of spiritual evil work their fell purposes. Harmony
was restored first of all to his own soul, and thence to the room and
all its occupants.

And, after himself, the first to recognise it was the old dog lying
in his corner. Flame began suddenly uttering sounds of pleasure, that
â€œsomethingâ€ between a growl and a grunt that dogs make upon being
restored to their masterâ€™s confidence. Dr. Silence heard the thumping
of the collieâ€™s tail against the ground. And the grunt and the thumping
touched the depth of affection in the manâ€™s heart, and gave him some
inkling of what agonies the dumb creature had suffered.

Next, from the shadows by the window, a somewhat shrill purring
announced the restoration of the cat to its normal state. Smoke was
advancing across the carpet. He seemed very pleased with himself, and
smiled with an expression of supreme innocence. He was no shadow-cat,
but real and full of his usual and perfect self-possession. He marched
along, picking his way delicately, but with a stately dignity that
suggested his ancestry with the majesty of Egypt. His eyes no longer
glared; they shone steadily before him; they radiated, not excitement,
but knowledge. Clearly he was anxious to make amends for the mischief
to which he had unwittingly lent himself owing to his subtle and
electric constitution.

Still uttering his sharp high purrings he marched up to his master and
rubbed vigorously against his legs. Then he stood on his hind feet and
pawed his knees and stared beseechingly up into his face. He turned his
head towards the corner where the collie still lay, thumping his tail
feebly and pathetically.

John Silence understood. He bent down and stroked the creatureâ€™s living
fur, noting the line of bright blue sparks that followed the motion of
his hand down its back. And then they advanced together towards the
corner where the dog was.

Smoke went first and put his nose gently against his friendâ€™s muzzle,
purring while he rubbed, and uttering little soft sounds of affection
in his throat. The doctor lit the candle and brought it over. He
saw the collie lying on its side against the wall; it was utterly
exhausted, and foam still hung about its jaws. Its tail and eyes
responded to the sound of its name, but it was evidently very weak and
overcome. Smoke continued to rub against its cheek and nose and eyes,
sometimes even standing on its body and kneading into the thick yellow
hair. Flame replied from time to time by little licks of the tongue,
most of them curiously misdirected.

But Dr. Silence felt intuitively that something disastrous had
happened, and his heart was wrung. He stroked the dear body, feeling
it over for bruises or broken bones, but finding none. He fed it with
what remained of the sandwiches and milk, but the creature clumsily
upset the saucer and lost the sandwiches between its paws, so that the
doctor had to feed it with his own hand. And all the while Smoke meowed
piteously.

Then John Silence began to understand. He went across to the farther
side of the room and called aloud to it.

â€œFlame, old man! come!â€

At any other time the dog would have been upon him in an instant,
barking and leaping to the shoulder. And even now he got up, though
heavily and awkwardly, to his feet. He started to run, wagging his
tail more briskly. He collided first with a chair, and then ran
straight into a table. Smoke trotted close at his side, trying his very
best to guide him. But it was useless. Dr. Silence had to lift him up
into his own arms and carry him like a baby. For he was blind.


III

It was a week later when John Silence called to see the author in his
new house, and found him well on the way to recovery and already busy
again with his writing. The haunted look had left his eyes, and he
seemed cheerful and confident.

â€œHumour restored?â€ laughed the doctor, as soon as they were comfortably
settled in the room overlooking the Park.

â€œIâ€™ve had no trouble since I left that dreadful place,â€ returned Pender
gratefully; â€œand thanks to you----â€

The doctor stopped him with a gesture.

â€œNever mind that,â€ he said, â€œweâ€™ll discuss your new plans afterwards,
and my scheme for relieving you of the house and helping you settle
elsewhere. Of course it must be pulled down, for itâ€™s not fit for any
sensitive person to live in, and any other tenant might be afflicted
in the same way you were. Although, personally, I think the evil has
exhausted itself by now.â€

He told the astonished author something of his experiences in it with
the animals.

â€œI donâ€™t pretend to understand,â€ Pender said, when the account was
finished, â€œbut I and my wife are intensely relieved to be free of it
all. Only I must say I should like to know something of the former
history of the house. When we took it six months ago I heard no word
against it.â€

Dr. Silence drew a typewritten paper from his pocket.

â€œI can satisfy your curiosity to some extent,â€ he said, running
his eye over the sheets, and then replacing them in his coat; â€œfor
by my secretaryâ€™s investigations I have been able to check certain
information obtained in the hypnotic trance by a â€˜sensitiveâ€™ who helps
me in such cases. The former occupant who haunted you appears to have
been a woman of singularly atrocious life and character who finally
suffered death by hanging, after a series of crimes that appalled the
whole of England and only came to light by the merest chance. She came
to her end in the year 1798, for it was not this particular house she
lived in, but a much larger one that then stood upon the site it now
occupies, and was then, of course, not in London, but in the country.
She was a person of intellect, possessed of a powerful, trained will,
and of consummate audacity, and I am convinced availed herself of the
resources of the lower magic to attain her ends. This goes far to
explain the virulence of the attack upon yourself, and why she is still
able to carry on after death the evil practices that formed her main
purpose during life.â€

â€œYou think that after death a soul can still consciously direct----â€
gasped the author.

â€œI think, as I told you before, that the forces of a powerful
personality may still persist after death in the line of their original
momentum,â€ replied the doctor; â€œand that strong thoughts and purposes
can still react upon suitably prepared brains long after their
originators have passed away.

â€œIf you knew anything of magic,â€ he pursued, â€œyou would know that
thought is dynamic, and that it may call into existence forms and
pictures that may well exist for hundreds of years. For, not far
removed from the region of our human life, is another region where
floats the waste and drift of all the centuries, the limbo of the
shells of the dead; a densely populated region crammed with horror and
abomination of all descriptions, and sometimes galvanised into active
life again by the will of a trained manipulator, a mind versed in the
practices of lower magic. That this woman understood its vile commerce,
I am persuaded, and the forces she set going during her life have
simply been accumulating ever since, and would have continued to do so
had they not been drawn down upon yourself, and afterwards discharged
and satisfied through me.

â€œAnything might have brought down the attack, for, besides drugs,
there are certain violent emotions, certain moods of the soul, certain
spiritual fevers, if I may so call them, which directly open the inner
being to a cognisance of this astral region I have mentioned. In your
case it happened to be a peculiarly potent drug that did it.

â€œBut now, tell me,â€ he added, after a pause, handing to the perplexed
author a pencil-drawing he had made of the dark countenance that had
appeared to him during the night on Putney Hill--â€œtell me if you
recognise this face?â€

Pender looked at the drawing closely, greatly astonished. He shuddered
a little as he looked.

â€œUndoubtedly,â€ he said, â€œit is the face I kept trying to draw--dark,
with the great mouth and jaw, and the drooping eye. That is the woman.â€

Dr. Silence then produced from his pocket-book an old-fashioned woodcut
of the same person which his secretary had unearthed from the records
of the Newgate Calendar. The woodcut and the pencil drawing were two
different aspects of the same dreadful visage. The men compared them
for some moments in silence.

â€œIt makes me thank God for the limitations of our senses,â€ said
Pender quietly, with a sigh; â€œcontinuous clairvoyance must be a sore
affliction.â€

â€œIt is indeed,â€ returned John Silence significantly, â€œand if all
the people nowadays who claim to be clairvoyant were really so, the
statistics of suicide and lunacy would be considerably higher than they
are. It is little wonder,â€ he added, â€œthat your sense of humour was
clouded, with the mind-forces of that dead monster trying to use your
brain for their dissemination. You have had an interesting adventure,
Mr. Felix Pender, and, let me add, a fortunate escape.â€

The author was about to renew his thanks when there came a sound of
scratching at the door, and the doctor sprang up quickly.

â€œItâ€™s time for me to go. I left my dog on the step, but I suppose----â€

Before he had time to open the door, it had yielded to the pressure
behind it and flew wide open to admit a great yellow-haired collie.
The dog, wagging his tail and contorting his whole body with delight,
tore across the floor and tried to leap up upon his ownerâ€™s breast. And
there was laughter and happiness in the old eyes; for they were clear
again as the day.




CASE II

ANCIENT SORCERIES


I

There are, it would appear, certain wholly unremarkable persons, with
none of the characteristics that invite adventure, who yet once or
twice in the course of their smooth lives undergo an experience so
strange that the world catches its breath--and looks the other way! And
it was cases of this kind, perhaps, more than any other, that fell into
the widespread net of John Silence, the psychic doctor, and, appealing
to his deep humanity, to his patience, and to his great qualities of
spiritual sympathy, led often to the revelation of problems of the
strangest complexity, and of the profoundest possible human interest.

Matters that seemed almost too curious and fantastic for belief he
loved to trace to their hidden sources. To unravel a tangle in the
very soul of things--and to release a suffering human soul in the
process--was with him a veritable passion. And the knots he untied
were, indeed, often passing strange.

The world, of course, asks for some plausible basis to which it can
attach credence--something it can, at least, pretend to explain.
The adventurous type it can understand: such people carry about
with them an adequate explanation of their exciting lives, and their
characters obviously drive them into the circumstances which produce
the adventures. It expects nothing else from them, and is satisfied.
But dull, ordinary folk have no right to out-of-the-way experiences,
and the world having been led to expect otherwise, is disappointed
with them, not to say shocked. Its complacent judgment has been rudely
disturbed.

â€œSuch a thing happen to _that_ man!â€ it cries--â€œa commonplace person
like that! It is too absurd! There must be something wrong!â€

Yet there could be no question that something did actually happen to
little Arthur Vezin, something of the curious nature he described to
Dr. Silence. Outwardly, or inwardly, it happened beyond a doubt, and in
spite of the jeers of his few friends who heard the tale, and observed
wisely that â€œsuch a thing might perhaps have come to Iszard, that
crack-brained Iszard, or to that odd fish Minski, but it could never
have happened to commonplace little Vezin, who was fore-ordained to
live and die according to scale.â€

But, whatever his method of death was, Vezin certainly did not â€œlive
according to scaleâ€ so far as this particular event in his otherwise
uneventful life was concerned; and to hear him recount it, and watch
his pale delicate features change, and hear his voice grow softer
and more hushed as he proceeded, was to know the conviction that his
halting words perhaps failed sometimes to convey. He lived the thing
over again each time he told it. His whole personality became muffled
in the recital. It subdued him more than ever, so that the tale became
a lengthy apology for an experience that he deprecated. He appeared to
excuse himself and ask your pardon for having dared to take part in so
fantastic an episode. For little Vezin was a timid, gentle, sensitive
soul, rarely able to assert himself, tender to man and beast, and
almost constitutionally unable to say No, or to claim many things that
should rightly have been his. His whole scheme of life seemed utterly
remote from anything more exciting than missing a train or losing an
umbrella on an omnibus. And when this curious event came upon him he
was already more years beyond forty than his friends suspected or he
cared to admit.

John Silence, who heard him speak of his experience more than once,
said that he sometimes left out certain details and put in others;
yet they were all obviously true. The whole scene was unforgettably
cinematographed on to his mind. None of the details were imagined
or invented. And when he told the story with them all complete, the
effect was undeniable. His appealing brown eyes shone, and much of the
charming personality, usually so carefully repressed, came forward and
revealed itself. His modesty was always there, of course, but in the
telling he forgot the present and allowed himself to appear almost
vividly as he lived again in the past of his adventure.

He was on the way home when it happened, crossing northern France from
some mountain trip or other where he buried himself solitary-wise
every summer. He had nothing but an unregistered bag in the rack, and
the train was jammed to suffocation, most of the passengers being
unredeemed holiday English. He disliked them, not because they were
his fellow-countrymen, but because they were noisy and obtrusive,
obliterating with their big limbs and tweed clothing all the quieter
tints of the day that brought him satisfaction and enabled him to melt
into insignificance and forget that he was anybody. These English
clashed about him like a brass band, making him feel vaguely that he
ought to be more self-assertive and obstreperous, and that he did not
claim insistently enough all kinds of things that he didnâ€™t want and
that were really valueless, such as corner seats, windows up or down,
and so forth.

So that he felt uncomfortable in the train, and wished the journey were
over and he was back again living with his unmarried sister in Surbiton.

And when the train stopped for ten panting minutes at the little
station in northern France, and he got out to stretch his legs on the
platform, and saw to his dismay a further batch of the British Isles
debouching from another train, it suddenly seemed impossible to him to
continue the journey. Even _his_ flabby soul revolted, and the idea of
staying a night in the little town and going on next day by a slower,
emptier train, flashed into his mind. The guard was already shouting
â€œ_en voiture_â€ and the corridor of his compartment was already packed
when the thought came to him. And, for once, he acted with decision and
rushed to snatch his bag.

Finding the corridor and steps impassable, he tapped at the window
(for he had a corner seat) and begged the Frenchman who sat opposite
to hand his luggage out to him, explaining in his wretched French that
he intended to break the journey there. And this elderly Frenchman, he
declared, gave him a look, half of warning, half of reproach, that to
his dying day he could never forget; handed the bag through the window
of the moving train; and at the same time poured into his ears a long
sentence, spoken rapidly and low, of which he was able to comprehend
only the last few words: â€œ_Ã  cause du sommeil et Ã  cause des chats_.â€

In reply to Dr. Silence, whose singular psychic acuteness at once
seized upon this Frenchman as a vital point in the adventure,
Vezin admitted that the man had impressed him favourably from the
beginning, though without being able to explain why. They had sat
facing one another during the four hours of the journey, and though
no conversation had passed between them--Vezin was timid about his
stuttering French--he confessed that his eyes were being continually
drawn to his face, almost, he felt, to rudeness, and that each, by a
dozen nameless little politenesses and attentions, had evinced the
desire to be kind. The men liked each other and their personalities
did not clash, or would not have clashed had they chanced to come to
terms of acquaintance. The Frenchman, indeed, seemed to have exercised
a silent protective influence over the insignificant little Englishman,
and without words or gestures betrayed that he wished him well and
would gladly have been of service to him.

â€œAnd this sentence that he hurled at you after the bag?â€ asked John
Silence, smiling that peculiarly sympathetic smile that always melted
the prejudices of his patient, â€œwere you unable to follow it exactly?â€

â€œIt was so quick and low and vehement,â€ explained Vezin, in his small
voice, â€œthat I missed practically the whole of it. I only caught the
few words at the very end, because he spoke them so clearly, and his
face was bent down out of the carriage window so near to mine.â€

â€œ_â€˜A cause du sommeil et Ã  cause des chatsâ€™?_â€ repeated Dr. Silence, as
though half speaking to himself.

â€œThatâ€™s it exactly,â€ said Vezin; â€œwhich, I take it, means something
like â€˜because of sleep and because of the cats,â€™ doesnâ€™t it?â€

â€œCertainly, thatâ€™s how I should translate it,â€ the doctor observed
shortly, evidently not wishing to interrupt more than necessary.

â€œAnd the rest of the sentence--all the first part I couldnâ€™t
understand, I mean--was a warning not to do something--not to stop in
the town, or at some particular place in the town, perhaps. That was
the impression it made on me.â€

Then, of course, the train rushed off, and left Vezin standing on the
platform alone and rather forlorn.

The little town climbed in straggling fashion up a sharp hill rising
out of the plain at the back of the station, and was crowned by the
twin towers of the ruined cathedral peeping over the summit. From the
station itself it looked uninteresting and modern, but the fact was
that the mediÃ¦val position lay out of sight just beyond the crest. And
once he reached the top and entered the old streets, he stepped clean
out of modern life into a bygone century. The noise and bustle of the
crowded train seemed days away. The spirit of this silent hill-town,
remote from tourists and motor-cars, dreaming its own quiet life under
the autumn sun, rose up and cast its spell upon him. Long before he
recognised this spell he acted under it. He walked softly, almost on
tiptoe, down the winding narrow streets where the gables all but met
over his head, and he entered the doorway of the solitary inn with a
deprecating and modest demeanour that was in itself an apology for
intruding upon the place and disturbing its dream.

At first, however, Vezin said, he noticed very little of all this. The
attempt at analysis came much later. What struck him then was only the
delightful contrast of the silence and peace after the dust and noisy
rattle of the train. He felt soothed and stroked like a cat.

â€œLike a cat, you said?â€ interrupted John Silence, quickly catching him
up.

â€œYes. At the very start I felt that.â€ He laughed apologetically. â€œI
felt as though the warmth and the stillness and the comfort made me
purr. It seemed to be the general mood of the whole place--then.â€

The inn, a rambling ancient house, the atmosphere of the old coaching
days still about it, apparently did not welcome him too warmly. He felt
he was only tolerated, he said. But it was cheap and comfortable, and
the delicious cup of afternoon tea he ordered at once made him feel
really very pleased with himself for leaving the train in this bold,
original way. For to him it had seemed bold and original. He felt
something of a dog. His room, too, soothed him with its dark panelling
and low irregular ceiling, and the long sloping passage that led to it
seemed the natural pathway to a real Chamber of Sleep--a little dim
cubby hole out of the world where noise could not enter. It looked
upon the courtyard at the back. It was all very charming, and made
him think of himself as dressed in very soft velvet somehow, and the
floors seemed padded, the walls provided with cushions. The sounds of
the streets could not penetrate there. It was an atmosphere of absolute
rest that surrounded him.

On engaging the two-franc room he had interviewed the only person
who seemed to be about that sleepy afternoon, an elderly waiter with
Dundreary whiskers and a drowsy courtesy, who had ambled lazily towards
him across the stone yard; but on coming downstairs again for a little
promenade in the town before dinner he encountered the proprietress
herself. She was a large woman whose hands, feet, and features seemed
to swim towards him out of a sea of person. They emerged, so to speak.
But she had great dark, vivacious eyes that counteracted the bulk of
her body, and betrayed the fact that in reality she was both vigorous
and alert. When he first caught sight of her she was knitting in a low
chair against the sunlight of the wall, and something at once made him
see her as a great tabby cat, dozing, yet awake, heavily sleepy, and
yet at the same time prepared for instantaneous action. A great mouser
on the watch occurred to him.

She took him in with a single comprehensive glance that was polite
without being cordial. Her neck, he noticed, was extraordinarily supple
in spite of its proportions, for it turned so easily to follow him, and
the head it carried bowed so very flexibly.

â€œBut when she looked at me, you know,â€ said Vezin, with that little
apologetic smile in his brown eyes, and that faintly deprecating
gesture of the shoulders that was characteristic of him, â€œthe odd
notion came to me that really she had intended to make quite a
different movement, and that with a single bound she could have leaped
at me across the width of that stone yard and pounced upon me like some
huge cat upon a mouse.â€

He laughed a little soft laugh, and Dr. Silence made a note in his book
without interrupting, while Vezin proceeded in a tone as though he
feared he had already told too much and more than we could believe.

â€œVery soft, yet very active she was, for all her size and mass, and I
felt she knew what I was doing even after I had passed and was behind
her back. She spoke to me, and her voice was smooth and running. She
asked if I had my luggage, and was comfortable in my room, and then
added that dinner was at seven oâ€™clock, and that they were very early
people in this little country town. Clearly, she intended to convey
that late hours were not encouraged.â€

Evidently, she contrived by voice and manner to give him the impression
that here he would be â€œmanaged,â€ that everything would be arranged and
planned for him, and that he had nothing to do but fall into the groove
and obey. No decided action or sharp personal effort would be looked
for from him. It was the very reverse of the train. He walked quietly
out into the street feeling soothed and peaceful. He realised that he
was in a _milieu_ that suited him and stroked him the right way. It was
so much easier to be obedient. He began to purr again, and to feel that
all the town purred with him.

About the streets of that little town he meandered gently, falling
deeper and deeper into the spirit of repose that characterised it. With
no special aim he wandered up and down, and to and fro. The September
sunshine fell slantingly over the roofs. Down winding alleyways,
fringed with tumbling gables and open casements, he caught fairylike
glimpses of the great plain below, and of the meadows and yellow copses
lying like a dream-map in the haze. The spell of the past held very
potently here, he felt.

The streets were full of picturesquely garbed men and women, all busy
enough, going their respective ways; but no one took any notice of him
or turned to stare at his obviously English appearance. He was even
able to forget that with his tourist appearance he was a false note in
a charming picture, and he melted more and more into the scene, feeling
delightfully insignificant and unimportant and unselfconscious. It was
like becoming part of a softly-coloured dream which he did not even
realise to be a dream.

On the eastern side the hill fell away more sharply, and the plain
below ran off rather suddenly into a sea of gathering shadows in which
the little patches of woodland looked like islands and the stubble
fields like deep water. Here he strolled along the old ramparts of
ancient fortifications that once had been formidable, but now were
only vision-like with their charming mingling of broken grey walls
and wayward vine and ivy. From the broad coping on which he sat for a
moment, level with the rounded tops of clipped plane trees, he saw the
esplanade far below lying in shadow. Here and there a yellow sunbeam
crept in and lay upon the fallen yellow leaves, and from the height
he looked down and saw that the townsfolk were walking to and fro in
the cool of the evening. He could just hear the sound of their slow
footfalls, and the murmur of their voices floated up to him through the
gaps between the trees. The figures looked like shadows as he caught
glimpses of their quiet movements far below.

He sat there for some time pondering, bathed in the waves of murmurs
and half-lost echoes that rose to his ears, muffled by the leaves of
the plane trees. The whole town, and the little hill out of which it
grew as naturally as an ancient wood, seemed to him like a being lying
there half asleep on the plain and crooning to itself as it dozed.

And, presently, as he sat lazily melting into its dream, a sound of
horns and strings and wood instruments rose to his ears, and the town
band began to play at the far end of the crowded terrace below to
the accompaniment of a very soft, deep-throated drum. Vezin was very
sensitive to music, knew about it intelligently, and had even ventured,
unknown to his friends, upon the composition of quiet melodies with
low-running chords which he played to himself with the soft pedal when
no one was about. And this music floating up through the trees from an
invisible and doubtless very picturesque band of the townspeople wholly
charmed him. He recognised nothing that they played, and it sounded as
though they were simply improvising without a conductor. No definitely
marked time ran through the pieces, which ended and began oddly after
the fashion of wind through an Ã†olian harp. It was part of the place
and scene, just as the dying sunlight and faintly-breathing wind were
part of the scene and hour, and the mellow notes of old-fashioned
plaintive horns, pierced here and there by the sharper strings, all
half smothered by the continuous booming of the deep drum, touched his
soul with a curiously potent spell that was almost too engrossing to be
quite pleasant.

There was a certain queer sense of bewitchment in it all. The music
seemed to him oddly unartificial. It made him think of trees swept by
the wind, of night breezes singing among wires and chimney-stacks, or
in the rigging of invisible ships; or--and the simile leaped up in his
thoughts with a sudden sharpness of suggestion--a chorus of animals,
of wild creatures, somewhere in desolate places of the world, crying
and singing as animals will, to the moon. He could fancy he heard the
wailing, half-human cries of cats upon the tiles at night, rising and
falling with weird intervals of sound, and this music, muffled by
distance and the trees, made him think of a queer company of these
creatures on some roof far away in the sky, uttering their solemn music
to one another and the moon in chorus.

It was, he felt at the time, a singular image to occur to him, yet it
expressed his sensation pictorially better than anything else. The
instruments played such impossibly odd intervals, and the crescendos
and diminuendos were so very suggestive of cat-land on the tiles at
night, rising swiftly, dropping without warning to deep notes again,
and all in such strange confusion of discords and accords. But, at the
same time a plaintive sweetness resulted on the whole, and the discords
of these half-broken instruments were so singular that they did not
distress his musical soul like fiddles out of tune.

He listened a long time, wholly surrendering himself as his character
was, and then strolled homewards in the dusk as the air grew chilly.

â€œThere was nothing to alarm?â€ put in Dr. Silence briefly.

â€œAbsolutely nothing,â€ said Vezin; â€œbut you know it was all so
fantastical and charming that my imagination was profoundly impressed.
Perhaps, too,â€ he continued, gently explanatory, â€œit was this stirring
of my imagination that caused other impressions; for, as I walked back,
the spell of the place began to steal over me in a dozen ways, though
all intelligible ways. But there were other things I could not account
for in the least, even then.â€

â€œIncidents, you mean?â€

â€œHardly incidents, I think. A lot of vivid sensations crowded
themselves upon my mind and I could trace them to no causes. It was
just after sunset and the tumbled old buildings traced magical outlines
against an opalescent sky of gold and red. The dusk was running down
the twisted streets. All round the hill the plain pressed in like a
dim sea, its level rising with the darkness. The spell of this kind of
scene, you know, can be very moving, and it was so that night. Yet I
felt that what came to me had nothing directly to do with the mystery
and wonder of the scene.â€

â€œNot merely the subtle transformations of the spirit that come with
beauty,â€ put in the doctor, noticing his hesitation.

â€œExactly,â€ Vezin went on, duly encouraged and no longer so fearful
of our smiles at his expense. â€œThe impressions came from somewhere
else. For instance, down the busy main street where men and women were
bustling home from work, shopping at stalls and barrows, idly gossiping
in groups, and all the rest of it, I saw that I aroused no interest and
that no one turned to stare at me as a foreigner and stranger. I was
utterly ignored, and my presence among them excited no special interest
or attention.

â€œAnd then, quite suddenly, it dawned upon me with conviction that
all the time this indifference and inattention were merely feigned.
Everybody as a matter of fact was watching me closely. Every movement
I made was known and observed. Ignoring me was all a pretence--an
elaborate pretence.â€

He paused a moment and looked at us to see if we were smiling, and then
continued, reassured--

â€œIt is useless to ask me how I noticed this, because I simply cannot
explain it. But the discovery gave me something of a shock. Before I
got back to the inn, however, another curious thing rose up strongly in
my mind and forced my recognition of it as true. And this, too, I may
as well say at once, was equally inexplicable to me. I mean I can only
give you the fact, as fact it was to me.â€

The little man left his chair and stood on the mat before the fire.
His diffidence lessened from now onwards, as he lost himself again in
the magic of the old adventure. His eyes shone a little already as he
talked.

â€œWell,â€ he went on, his soft voice rising somewhat with his excitement,
â€œI was in a shop when it came to me first--though the idea must have
been at work for a long time subconsciously to appear in so complete
a form all at once. I was buying socks, I think,â€ he laughed, â€œand
struggling with my dreadful French, when it struck me that the woman in
the shop did not care two pins whether I bought anything or not. She
was indifferent whether she made a sale or did not make a sale. She was
only pretending to sell.

â€œThis sounds a very small and fanciful incident to build upon what
follows. But really it was not small. I mean it was the spark that lit
the line of powder and ran along to the big blaze in my mind.

â€œFor the whole town, I suddenly realised, was something other than I
so far saw it. The real activities and interests of the people were
elsewhere and otherwise than appeared. Their true lives lay somewhere
out of sight behind the scenes. Their busy-ness was but the outward
semblance that masked their actual purposes. They bought and sold, and
ate and drank, and walked about the streets, yet all the while the main
stream of their existence lay somewhere beyond my ken, underground, in
secret places. In the shops and at the stalls they did not care whether
I purchased their articles or not; at the inn, they were indifferent
to my staying or going; their life lay remote from my own, springing
from hidden, mysterious sources, coursing out of sight, unknown. It
was all a great elaborate pretence, assumed possibly for my benefit,
or possibly for purposes of their own. But the main current of their
energies ran elsewhere. I almost felt as an unwelcome foreign substance
might be expected to feel when it has found its way into the human
system and the whole body organises itself to eject it or to absorb it.
The town was doing this very thing to me.

â€œThis bizarre notion presented itself forcibly to my mind as I walked
home to the inn, and I began busily to wonder wherein the true life of
this town could lie and what were the actual interests and activities
of its hidden life.

â€œAnd, now that my eyes were partly opened, I noticed other things
too that puzzled me, first of which, I think, was the extraordinary
silence of the whole place. Positively, the town was muffled. Although
the streets were paved with cobbles the people moved about silently,
softly, with padded feet, like cats. Nothing made noise. All was
hushed, subdued, muted. The very voices were quiet, low-pitched like
purring. Nothing clamorous, vehement or emphatic seemed able to live
in the drowsy atmosphere of soft dreaming that soothed this little
hill-town into its sleep. It was like the woman at the inn--an outward
repose screening intense inner activity and purpose.

â€œYet there was no sign of lethargy or sluggishness anywhere about it.
The people were active and alert. Only a magical and uncanny softness
lay over them all like a spell.â€

Vezin passed his hand across his eyes for a moment as though the memory
had become very vivid. His voice had run off into a whisper so that
we heard the last part with difficulty. He was telling a true thing
obviously, yet something that he both liked and hated telling.

â€œI went back to the inn,â€ he continued presently in a louder voice,
â€œand dined. I felt a new strange world about me. My old world of
reality receded. Here, whether I liked it or no, was something new and
incomprehensible. I regretted having left the train so impulsively.
An adventure was upon me, and I loathed adventures as foreign to my
nature. Moreover, this was the beginning apparently of an adventure
somewhere deep within me, in a region I could not check or measure,
and a feeling of alarm mingled itself with my wonder--alarm for the
stability of what I had for forty years recognised as my â€˜personality.â€™

â€œI went upstairs to bed, my mind teeming with thoughts that were
unusual to me, and of rather a haunting description. By way of
relief I kept thinking of that nice, prosaic noisy train and all
those wholesome, blustering passengers. I almost wished I were with
them again. But my dreams took me elsewhere. I dreamed of cats, and
soft-moving creatures, and the silence of life in a dim muffled world
beyond the senses.â€


II

Vezin stayed on from day to day, indefinitely, much longer than he
had intended. He felt in a kind of dazed, somnolent condition. He did
nothing in particular, but the place fascinated him and he could not
decide to leave. Decisions were always very difficult for him and he
sometimes wondered how he had ever brought himself to the point of
leaving the train. It seemed as though some one else must have arranged
it for him, and once or twice his thoughts ran to the swarthy Frenchman
who had sat opposite. If only he could have understood that long
sentence ending so strangely with â€œ_Ã  cause du sommeil et Ã  cause des
chats_.â€ He wondered what it all meant.

Meanwhile the hushed softness of the town held him prisoner and he
sought in his muddling, gentle way to find out where the mystery
lay, and what it was all about. But his limited French and his
constitutional hatred of active investigation made it hard for him to
buttonhole anybody and ask questions. He was content to observe, and
watch, and remain negative.

The weather held on calm and hazy, and this just suited him. He
wandered about the town till he knew every street and alley. The
people suffered him to come and go without let or hindrance, though
it became clearer to him every day that he was never free himself from
observation. The town watched him as a cat watches a mouse. And he got
no nearer to finding out what they were all so busy with or where the
main stream of their activities lay. This remained hidden. The people
were as soft and mysterious as cats.

But that he was continually under observation became more evident from
day to day.

For instance, when he strolled to the end of the town and entered a
little green public garden beneath the ramparts and seated himself upon
one of the empty benches in the sun, he was quite alone--at first.
Not another seat was occupied; the little park was empty, the paths
deserted. Yet, within ten minutes of his coming, there must have been
fully twenty persons scattered about him, some strolling aimlessly
along the gravel walks, staring at the flowers, and others seated on
the wooden benches enjoying the sun like himself. None of them appeared
to take any notice of him; yet he understood quite well they had all
come there to watch. They kept him under close observation. In the
street they had seemed busy enough, hurrying upon various errands; yet
these were suddenly all forgotten and they had nothing to do but loll
and laze in the sun, their duties unremembered. Five minutes after
he left, the garden was again deserted, the seats vacant. But in the
crowded street it was the same thing again; he was never alone. He was
ever in their thoughts.

By degrees, too, he began to see how it was he was so cleverly watched,
yet without the appearance of it. The people did nothing _directly_.
They behaved _obliquely_. He laughed in his mind as the thought thus
clothed itself in words, but the phrase exactly described it. They
looked at him from angles which naturally should have led their sight
in another direction altogether. Their movements were oblique, too,
so far as these concerned himself. The straight, direct thing was
not their way evidently. They did nothing obviously. If he entered a
shop to buy, the woman walked instantly away and busied herself with
something at the farther end of the counter, though answering at once
when he spoke, showing that she knew he was there and that this was
only her way of attending to him. It was the fashion of the cat she
followed. Even in the dining-room of the inn, the be-whiskered and
courteous waiter, lithe and silent in all his movements, never seemed
able to come straight to his table for an order or a dish. He came
by zigzags, indirectly, vaguely, so that he appeared to be going to
another table altogether, and only turned suddenly at the last moment,
and was there beside him.

Vezin smiled curiously to himself as he described how he began to
realise these things. Other tourists there were none in the hostel, but
he recalled the figures of one or two old men, inhabitants, who took
their _dÃ©jeuner_ and dinner there, and remembered how fantastically
they entered the room in similar fashion. First, they paused in
the doorway, peering about the room, and then, after a temporary
inspection, they came in, as it were, sideways, keeping close to the
walls so that he wondered which table they were making for, and at the
last minute making almost a little quick run to their particular seats.
And again he thought of the ways and methods of cats.

Other small incidents, too, impressed him as all part of this queer,
soft town with its muffled, indirect life, for the way some of the
people appeared and disappeared with extraordinary swiftness puzzled
him exceedingly. It may have been all perfectly natural, he knew, yet
he could not make it out how the alleys swallowed them up and shot
them forth in a second of time when there were no visible doorways or
openings near enough to explain the phenomenon. Once he followed two
elderly women who, he felt, had been particularly examining him from
across the street--quite near the inn this was--and saw them turn the
corner a few feet only in front of him. Yet when he sharply followed
on their heels he saw nothing but an utterly deserted alley stretching
in front of him with no sign of a living thing. And the only opening
through which they could have escaped was a porch some fifty yards
away, which not the swiftest human runner could have reached in time.

And in just such sudden fashion people appeared when he never expected
them. Once when he heard a great noise of fighting going on behind a
low wall, and hurried up to see what was going on, what should he see
but a group of girls and women engaged in vociferous conversation which
instantly hushed itself to the normal whispering note of the town when
his head appeared over the wall. And even then none of them turned
to look at him directly, but slunk off with the most unaccountable
rapidity into doors and sheds across the yard. And their voices, he
thought, had sounded so like, so strangely like, the angry snarling of
fighting animals, almost of cats.

The whole spirit of the town, however, continued to evade him as
something elusive, protean, screened from the outer world, and at the
same time intensely, genuinely vital; and, since he now formed part of
its life, this concealment puzzled and irritated him; more--it began
rather to frighten him.

Out of the mists that slowly gathered about his ordinary surface
thoughts, there rose again the idea that the inhabitants were waiting
for him to declare himself, to take an attitude, to do this, or to do
that; and that when he had done so they in their turn would at length
make some direct response, accepting or rejecting him. Yet the vital
matter concerning which his decision was awaited came no nearer to him.

Once or twice he purposely followed little processions or groups of
the citizens in order to find out, if possible, on what purpose they
were bent; but they always discovered him in time and dwindled away,
each individual going his or her own way. It was always the same: he
never could learn what their main interest was. The cathedral was ever
empty, the old church of St. Martin, at the other end of the town,
deserted. They shopped because they had to, and not because they wished
to. The booths stood neglected, the stalls unvisited, the little cafÃ©s
desolate. Yet the streets were always full, the townsfolk ever on the
bustle.

â€œCan it be,â€ he thought to himself, yet with a deprecating laugh that
he should have dared to think anything so odd, â€œcan it be that these
people are people of the twilight, that they live only at night their
real life, and come out honestly only with the dusk? That during the
day they make a sham though brave pretence, and after the sun is down
their true life begins? Have they the souls of night-things, and is the
whole blessed town in the hands of the cats?â€

The fancy somehow electrified him with little shocks of shrinking and
dismay. Yet, though he affected to laugh, he knew that he was beginning
to feel more than uneasy, and that strange forces were tugging with a
thousand invisible cords at the very centre of his being. Something
utterly remote from his ordinary life, something that had not waked for
years, began faintly to stir in his soul, sending feelers abroad into
his brain and heart, shaping queer thoughts and penetrating even into
certain of his minor actions. Something exceedingly vital to himself,
to his soul, hung in the balance.

And, always when he returned to the inn about the hour of sunset,
he saw the figures of the townsfolk stealing through the dusk from
their shop doors, moving sentry-wise to and fro at the corners of
the streets, yet always vanishing silently like shadows at his near
approach. And as the inn invariably closed its doors at ten oâ€™clock he
had never yet found the opportunity he rather half-heartedly sought to
see for himself what account the town could give of itself at night.

â€œ----_Ã  cause du sommeil et Ã  cause des chats_â€--the words now rang in
his ears more and more often, though still as yet without any definite
meaning.

Moreover, something made him sleep like the dead.


III

It was, I think, on the fifth day--though in this detail his story
sometimes varied--that he made a definite discovery which increased
his alarm and brought him up to a rather sharp climax. Before that he
had already noticed that a change was going forward and certain subtle
transformations being brought about in his character which modified
several of his minor habits. And he had affected to ignore them. Here,
however, was something he could no longer ignore; and it startled him.

At the best of times he was never very positive, always negative
rather, compliant and acquiescent; yet, when necessity arose he was
capable of reasonably vigorous action and could take a strongish
decision. The discovery he now made that brought him up with such a
sharp turn was that this power had positively dwindled to nothing.
He found it impossible to make up his mind. For, on this fifth day,
he realised that he had stayed long enough in the town and that for
reasons he could only vaguely define to himself it was wiser _and
safer_ that he should leave.

And he found that he could not leave!

This is difficult to describe in words, and it was more by gesture and
the expression of his face that he conveyed to Dr. Silence the state
of impotence he had reached. All this spying and watching, he said,
had as it were spun a net about his feet so that he was trapped and
powerless to escape; he felt like a fly that had blundered into the
intricacies of a great web; he was caught, imprisoned, and could not
get away. It was a distressing sensation. A numbness had crept over
his will till it had become almost incapable of decision. The mere
thought of vigorous action--action towards escape--began to terrify
him. All the currents of his life had turned inwards upon himself,
striving to bring to the surface something that lay buried almost
beyond reach, determined to force his recognition of something he had
long forgotten--forgotten years upon years, centuries almost ago. It
seemed as though a window deep within his being would presently open
and reveal an entirely new world, yet somehow a world that was not
unfamiliar. Beyond that, again, he fancied a great curtain hung; and
when that too rolled up he would see still farther into this region and
at last understand something of the secret life of these extraordinary
people.

â€œIs this why they wait and watch?â€ he asked himself with rather a
shaking heart, â€œfor the time when I shall join them--or refuse to join
them? Does the decision rest with me after all, and not with them?â€

And it was at this point that the sinister character of the adventure
first really declared itself, and he became genuinely alarmed. The
stability of his rather fluid little personality was at stake, he felt,
and something in his heart turned coward.

Why otherwise should he have suddenly taken to walking stealthily,
silently, making as little sound as possible, for ever looking behind
him? Why else should he have moved almost on tiptoe about the passages
of the practically deserted inn, and when he was abroad have found
himself deliberately taking advantage of what cover presented itself?
And why, if he was not afraid, should the wisdom of staying indoors
after sundown have suddenly occurred to him as eminently desirable?
Why, indeed?

And, when John Silence gently pressed him for an explanation of these
things, he admitted apologetically that he had none to give.

â€œIt was simply that I feared something might happen to me unless I kept
a sharp look-out. I felt afraid. It was instinctive,â€ was all he could
say. â€œI got the impression that the whole town was after me--wanted me
for something; and that if it got me I should lose myself, or at least
the Self I knew, in some unfamiliar state of consciousness. But I am
not a psychologist, you know,â€ he added meekly, â€œand I cannot define it
better than that.â€

It was while lounging in the courtyard half an hour before the evening
meal that Vezin made this discovery, and he at once went upstairs to
his quiet room at the end of the winding passage to think it over
alone. In the yard it was empty enough, true, but there was always the
possibility that the big woman whom he dreaded would come out of some
door, with her pretence of knitting, to sit and watch him. This had
happened several times, and he could not endure the sight of her. He
still remembered his original fancy, bizarre though it was, that she
would spring upon him the moment his back was turned and land with one
single crushing leap upon his neck. Of course it was nonsense, but then
it haunted him, and once an idea begins to do that it ceases to be
nonsense. It has clothed itself in reality.

He went upstairs accordingly. It was dusk, and the oil lamps had not
yet been lit in the passages. He stumbled over the uneven surface of
the ancient flooring, passing the dim outlines of doors along the
corridor--doors that he had never once seen opened--rooms that seemed
never occupied. He moved, as his habit now was, stealthily and on
tiptoe.

Half-way down the last passage to his own chamber there was a sharp
turn, and it was just here, while groping round the walls with
outstretched hands, that his fingers touched something that was
not wall--something that moved. It was soft and warm in texture,
indescribably fragrant, and about the height of his shoulder; and he
immediately thought of a furry, sweet-smelling kitten. The next minute
he knew it was something quite different.

Instead of investigating, however,--his nerves must have been too
overwrought for that, he said,--he shrank back as closely as possible
against the wall on the other side. The thing, whatever it was, slipped
past him with a sound of rustling, and retreating with light footsteps
down the passage behind him, was gone. A breath of warm, scented air
was wafted to his nostrils.

Vezin caught his breath for an instant and paused, stockstill, half
leaning against the wall--and then almost ran down the remaining
distance and entered his room with a rush, locking the door hurriedly
behind him. Yet it was not fear that made him run: it was excitement,
pleasurable excitement. His nerves were tingling, and a delicious glow
made itself felt all over his body. In a flash it came to him that this
was just what he had felt twenty-five years ago as a boy when he was
in love for the first time. Warm currents of life ran all over him and
mounted to his brain in a whirl of soft delight. His mood was suddenly
become tender, melting, loving.

The room was quite dark, and he collapsed upon the sofa by the window,
wondering what had happened to him and what it all meant. But the only
thing he understood clearly in that instant was that something in him
had swiftly, magically changed: he no longer wished to leave, or to
argue with himself about leaving. The encounter in the passage-way
had changed all that. The strange perfume of it still hung about him,
bemusing his heart and mind. For he knew that it was a girl who had
passed him, a girlâ€™s face that his fingers had brushed in the darkness,
and he felt in some extraordinary way as though he had been actually
kissed by her, kissed full upon the lips.

Trembling, he sat upon the sofa by the window and struggled to collect
his thoughts. He was utterly unable to understand how the mere passing
of a girl in the darkness of a narrow passage-way could communicate
so electric a thrill to his whole being that he still shook with the
sweetness of it. Yet, there it was! And he found it as useless to deny
as to attempt analysis. Some ancient fire had entered his veins, and
now ran coursing through his blood; and that he was forty-five instead
of twenty did not matter one little jot. Out of all the inner turmoil
and confusion emerged the one salient fact that the mere atmosphere,
the merest casual touch, of this girl, unseen, unknown in the darkness,
had been sufficient to stir dormant fires in the centre of his heart,
and rouse his whole being from a state of feeble sluggishness to one of
tearing and tumultuous excitement.

After a time, however, the number of Vezinâ€™s years began to assert
their cumulative power; he grew calmer; and when a knock came at
length upon his door and he heard the waiterâ€™s voice suggesting that
dinner was nearly over, he pulled himself together and slowly made his
way downstairs into the dining-room.

Every one looked up as he entered, for he was very late, but he took
his customary seat in the far corner and began to eat. The trepidation
was still in his nerves, but the fact that he had passed through the
courtyard and hall without catching sight of a petticoat served to calm
him a little. He ate so fast that he had almost caught up with the
current stage of the table dâ€™hÃ´te, when a slight commotion in the room
drew his attention.

His chair was so placed that the door and the greater portion of the
long _salle Ã  manger_ were behind him, yet it was not necessary to
turn round to know that the same person he had passed in the dark
passage had now come into the room. He felt the presence long before he
heard or saw any one. Then he became aware that the old men, the only
other guests, were rising one by one in their places, and exchanging
greetings with some one who passed among them from table to table. And
when at length he turned with his heart beating furiously to ascertain
for himself, he saw the form of a young girl, lithe and slim, moving
down the centre of the room and making straight for his own table in
the corner. She moved wonderfully, with sinuous grace, like a young
panther, and her approach filled him with such delicious bewilderment
that he was utterly unable to tell at first what her face was like, or
discover what it was about the whole presentment of the creature that
filled him anew with trepidation and delight.

â€œAh, Maâ€™mselle est de retour!â€ he heard the old waiter murmur at his
side, and he was just able to take in that she was the daughter of the
proprietress, when she was upon him, and he heard her voice. She was
addressing him. Something of red lips he saw and laughing white teeth,
and stray wisps of fine dark hair about the temples; but all the rest
was a dream in which his own emotion rose like a thick cloud before
his eyes and prevented his seeing accurately, or knowing exactly what
he did. He was aware that she greeted him with a charming little bow;
that her beautiful large eyes looked searchingly into his own; that the
perfume he had noticed in the dark passage again assailed his nostrils,
and that she was bending a little towards him and leaning with one
hand on the table at his side. She was quite close to him--that was
the chief thing he knew--explaining that she had been asking after the
comfort of her motherâ€™s guests, and was now introducing herself to the
latest arrival--himself.

â€œMâ€™sieur has already been here a few days,â€ he heard the waiter say;
and then her own voice, sweet as singing, replied--

â€œAh, but Mâ€™sieur is not going to leave us just yet, I hope. My mother
is too old to look after the comfort of our guests properly, but now
I am here I will remedy all that.â€ She laughed deliciously. â€œMâ€™sieur
shall be well looked after.â€

Vezin, struggling with his emotion and desire to be polite, half rose
to acknowledge the pretty speech, and to stammer some sort of reply,
but as he did so his hand by chance touched her own that was resting
upon the table, and a shock that was for all the world like a shock of
electricity, passed from her skin into his body. His soul wavered and
shook deep within him. He caught her eyes fixed upon his own with a
look of most curious intentness, and the next moment he knew that he
had sat down wordless again on his chair, that the girl was already
half-way across the room, and that he was trying to eat his salad with
a dessert-spoon and a knife.

Longing for her return, and yet dreading it, he gulped down the
remainder of his dinner, and then went at once to his bedroom to be
alone with his thoughts. This time the passages were lighted, and he
suffered no exciting contretemps; yet the winding corridor was dim with
shadows, and the last portion, from the bend of the walls onwards,
seemed longer than he had ever known it. It ran downhill like the
pathway on a mountain side, and as he tiptoed softly down it he felt
that by rights it ought to have led him clean out of the house into
the heart of a great forest. The world was singing with him. Strange
fancies filled his brain, and once in the room, with the door securely
locked, he did not light the candles, but sat by the open window
thinking long, long thoughts that came unbidden in troops to his mind.


IV

This part of the story he told to Dr. Silence, without special coaxing,
it is true, yet with much stammering embarrassment. He could not in
the least understand, he said, how the girl had managed to affect him
so profoundly, and even before he had set eyes upon her. For her mere
proximity in the darkness had been sufficient to set him on fire. He
knew nothing of enchantments, and for years had been a stranger to
anything approaching tender relations with any member of the opposite
sex, for he was encased in shyness, and realised his overwhelming
defects only too well. Yet this bewitching young creature came to him
deliberately. Her manner was unmistakable, and she sought him out on
every possible occasion. Chaste and sweet she was undoubtedly, yet
frankly inviting; and she won him utterly with the first glance of her
shining eyes, even if she had not already done so in the dark merely by
the magic of her invisible presence.

â€œYou felt she was altogether wholesome and good?â€ queried the doctor.
â€œYou had no reaction of any sort--for instance, of alarm?â€

Vezin looked up sharply with one of his inimitable little apologetic
smiles. It was some time before he replied. The mere memory of the
adventure had suffused his shy face with blushes, and his brown eyes
sought the floor again before he answered.

â€œI donâ€™t think I can quite say that,â€ he explained presently. â€œI
acknowledged certain qualms, sitting up in my room afterwards. A
conviction grew upon me that there was something about her--how shall I
express it?--well, something unholy. It is not impurity in any sense,
physical or mental, that I mean, but something quite indefinable that
gave me a vague sensation of the creeps. She drew me, and at the same
time repelled me, more than--than----â€

He hesitated, blushing furiously, and unable to finish the sentence.

â€œNothing like it has ever come to me before or since,â€ he concluded,
with lame confusion. â€œI suppose it was, as you suggested just now,
something of an enchantment. At any rate, it was strong enough to make
me feel that I would stay in that awful little haunted town for years
if only I could see her every day, hear her voice, watch her wonderful
movements, and sometimes, perhaps, touch her hand.â€

â€œCan you explain to me what you felt was the source of her power?â€ John
Silence asked, looking purposely anywhere but at the narrator.

â€œI am surprised that _you_ should ask me such a question,â€ answered
Vezin, with the nearest approach to dignity he could manage. â€œI think
no man can describe to another convincingly wherein lies the magic of
the woman who ensnares him. I certainly cannot. I can only say this
slip of a girl bewitched me, and the mere knowledge that she was living
and sleeping in the same house filled me with an extraordinary sense of
delight.

â€œBut thereâ€™s one thing I can tell you,â€ he went on earnestly, his eyes
aglow, â€œnamely, that she seemed to sum up and synthesise in herself
all the strange hidden forces that operated so mysteriously in the
town and its inhabitants. She had the silken movements of the panther,
going smoothly, silently to and fro, and the same indirect, oblique
methods as the townsfolk, screening, like them, secret purposes of
her own--purposes that I was sure had _me_ for their objective. She
kept me, to my terror and delight, ceaselessly under observation, yet
so carelessly, so consummately, that another man less sensitive, if I
may say soâ€--he made a deprecating gesture--â€œor less prepared by what
had gone before, would never have noticed it at all. She was always
still, always reposeful, yet she seemed to be everywhere at once, so
that I never could escape from her. I was continually meeting the stare
and laughter of her great eyes, in the corners of the rooms, in the
passages, calmly looking at me through the windows, or in the busiest
parts of the public streets.â€

Their intimacy, it seems, grew very rapidly after this first encounter
which had so violently disturbed the little manâ€™s equilibrium. He was
naturally very prim, and prim folk live mostly in so small a world that
anything violently unusual may shake them clean out of it, and they
therefore instinctively distrust originality. But Vezin began to forget
his primness after awhile. The girl was always modestly behaved, and
as her motherâ€™s representative she naturally had to do with the guests
in the hotel. It was not out of the way that a spirit of camaraderie
should spring up. Besides, she was young, she was charmingly pretty,
she was French, and--she obviously liked him.

At the same time, there was something indescribable--a certain
indefinable atmosphere of other places, other times--that made him try
hard to remain on his guard, and sometimes made him catch his breath
with a sudden start. It was all rather like a delirious dream, half
delight, half dread, he confided in a whisper to Dr. Silence; and more
than once he hardly knew quite what he was doing or saying, as though
he were driven forward by impulses he scarcely recognised as his own.

And though the thought of leaving presented itself again and again to
his mind, it was each time with less insistence, so that he stayed on
from day to day, becoming more and more a part of the sleepy life of
this dreamy mediÃ¦val town, losing more and more of his recognisable
personality. Soon, he felt, the Curtain within would roll up with an
awful rush, and he would find himself suddenly admitted into the
secret purposes of the hidden life that lay behind it all. Only, by
that time, he would have become transformed into an entirely different
being.

And, meanwhile, he noticed various little signs of the intention
to make his stay attractive to him: flowers in his bedroom, a more
comfortable arm-chair in the corner, and even special little extra
dishes on his private table in the dining-room. Conversations, too,
with â€œMademoiselle IlsÃ©â€ became more and more frequent and pleasant,
and although they seldom travelled beyond the weather, or the details
of the town, the girl, he noticed, was never in a hurry to bring them
to an end, and often contrived to interject little odd sentences that
he never properly understood, yet felt to be significant.

And it was these stray remarks, full of a meaning that evaded him, that
pointed to some hidden purpose of her own and made him feel uneasy.
They all had to do, he felt sure, with reasons for his staying on in
the town indefinitely.

â€œAnd has Mâ€™sieur not even yet come to a decision?â€ she said softly in
his ear, sitting beside him in the sunny yard before _dÃ©jeuner_, the
acquaintance having progressed with significant rapidity. â€œBecause, if
itâ€™s so difficult, we must all try together to help him!â€

The question startled him, following upon his own thoughts. It was
spoken with a pretty laugh, and a stray bit of hair across one eye, as
she turned and peered at him half roguishly. Possibly he did not quite
understand the French of it, for her near presence always confused
his small knowledge of the language distressingly. Yet the words, and
her manner, and something else that lay behind it all in her mind,
frightened him. It gave such point to his feeling that the town was
waiting for him to make his mind up on some important matter.

At the same time, her voice, and the fact that she was there so close
beside him in her soft dark dress, thrilled him inexpressibly.

â€œIt is true I find it difficult to leave,â€ he stammered, losing his
way deliciously in the depths of her eyes, â€œand especially now that
Mademoiselle IlsÃ© has come.â€

He was surprised at the success of his sentence, and quite delighted
with the little gallantry of it. But at the same time he could have
bitten his tongue off for having said it.

â€œThen after all you like our little town, or you would not be pleased
to stay on,â€ she said, ignoring the compliment.

â€œI am enchanted with it, and enchanted with you,â€ he cried, feeling
that his tongue was somehow slipping beyond the control of his brain.
And he was on the verge of saying all manner of other things of the
wildest description, when the girl sprang lightly up from her chair
beside him, and made to go.

â€œIt is _soupe Ã  lâ€™onion_ to-day!â€ she cried, laughing back at him
through the sunlight, â€œand I must go and see about it. Otherwise, you
know, Mâ€™sieur will not enjoy his dinner, and then, perhaps, he will
leave us!â€

He watched her cross the courtyard, moving with all the grace and
lightness of the feline race, and her simple black dress clothed her,
he thought, exactly like the fur of the same supple species. She turned
once to laugh at him from the porch with the glass door, and then
stopped a moment to speak to her mother, who sat knitting as usual in
her corner seat just inside the hall-way.

But how was it, then, that the moment his eye fell upon this ungainly
woman, the pair of them appeared suddenly as other than they were?
Whence came that transforming dignity and sense of power that enveloped
them both as by magic? What was it about that massive woman that
made her appear instantly regal, and set her on a throne in some
dark and dreadful scenery, wielding a sceptre over the red glare of
some tempestuous orgy? And why did this slender stripling of a girl,
graceful as a willow, lithe as a young leopard, assume suddenly an air
of sinister majesty, and move with flame and smoke about her head, and
the darkness of night beneath her feet?

Vezin caught his breath and sat there transfixed. Then, almost
simultaneously with its appearance, the queer notion vanished again,
and the sunlight of day caught them both, and he heard her laughing to
her mother about the _soupe Ã  lâ€™onion_, and saw her glancing back at
him over her dear little shoulder with a smile that made him think of a
dew-kissed rose bending lightly before summer airs.

And, indeed, the onion soup was particularly excellent that day,
because he saw another cover laid at his small table and, with
fluttering heart, heard the waiter murmur by way of explanation that
â€œMaâ€™mselle IlsÃ© would honour Mâ€™sieur to-day at _dÃ©jeuner_, as her
custom sometimes is with her motherâ€™s guests.â€

So actually she sat by him all through that delirious meal, talking
quietly to him in easy French, seeing that he was well looked after,
mixing the salad-dressing, and even helping him with her own hand.
And, later in the afternoon, while he was smoking in the courtyard,
longing for a sight of her as soon as her duties were done, she came
again to his side, and when he rose to meet her, she stood facing him a
moment, full of a perplexing sweet shyness before she spoke--

â€œMy mother thinks you ought to know more of the beauties of our little
town, and _I_ think so too! Would Mâ€™sieur like me to be his guide,
perhaps? I can show him everything, for our family has lived here for
many generations.â€

She had him by the hand, indeed, before he could find a single word
to express his pleasure, and led him, all unresisting, out into the
street, yet in such a way that it seemed perfectly natural she should
do so, and without the faintest suggestion of boldness or immodesty.
Her face glowed with the pleasure and interest of it, and with her
short dress and tumbled hair she looked every bit the charming child of
seventeen that she was, innocent and playful, proud of her native town,
and alive beyond her years to the sense of its ancient beauty.

So they went over the town together, and she showed him what she
considered its chief interest: the tumble-down old house where her
forebears had lived; the sombre, aristocratic-looking mansion where her
motherâ€™s family dwelt for centuries, and the ancient market-place where
several hundred years before the witches had been burnt by the score.
She kept up a lively running stream of talk about it all, of which he
understood not a fiftieth part as he trudged along by her side, cursing
his forty-five years and feeling all the yearnings of his early manhood
revive and jeer at him. And, as she talked, England and Surbiton
seemed very far away indeed, almost in another age of the worldâ€™s
history. Her voice touched something immeasurably old in him, something
that slept deep. It lulled the surface parts of his consciousness to
sleep, allowing what was far more ancient to awaken. Like the town,
with its elaborate pretence of modern active life, the upper layers
of his being became dulled, soothed, muffled, and what lay underneath
began to stir in its sleep. That big Curtain swayed a little to and
fro. Presently it might lift altogether....

He began to understand a little better at last. The mood of the town
was reproducing itself in him. In proportion as his ordinary external
self became muffled, that inner secret life, that was far more real and
vital, asserted itself. And this girl was surely the high-priestess of
it all, the chief instrument of its accomplishment. New thoughts, with
new interpretations, flooded his mind as she walked beside him through
the winding streets, while the picturesque old gabled town, softly
coloured in the sunset, had never appeared to him so wholly wonderful
and seductive.

And only one curious incident came to disturb and puzzle him, slight
in itself, but utterly inexplicable, bringing white terror into the
childâ€™s face and a scream to her laughing lips. He had merely pointed
to a column of blue smoke that rose from the burning autumn leaves
and made a picture against the red roofs, and had then run to the
wall and called her to his side to watch the flames shooting here and
there through the heap of rubbish. Yet, at the sight of it, as though
taken by surprise, her face had altered dreadfully, and she had turned
and run like the wind, calling out wild sentences to him as she ran,
of which he had not understood a single word, except that the fire
apparently frightened her, and she wanted to get quickly away from it,
and to get him away too.

Yet five minutes later she was as calm and happy again as though
nothing had happened to alarm or waken troubled thoughts in her, and
they had both forgotten the incident.

They were leaning over the ruined ramparts together listening to
the weird music of the band as he had heard it the first day of his
arrival. It moved him again profoundly as it had done before, and
somehow he managed to find his tongue and his best French. The girl
leaned across the stones close beside him. No one was about. Driven by
some remorseless engine within he began to stammer something--he hardly
knew what--of his strange admiration for her. Almost at the first word
she sprang lightly off the wall and came up smiling in front of him,
just touching his knees as he sat there. She was hatless as usual, and
the sun caught her hair and one side of her cheek and throat.

â€œOh, Iâ€™m _so_ glad!â€ she cried, clapping her little hands softly in his
face, â€œso very glad, because that means that if you like me you must
also like what I do, and what I belong to.â€

Already he regretted bitterly having lost control of himself. Something
in the phrasing of her sentence chilled him. He knew the fear of
embarking upon an unknown and dangerous sea.

â€œYou will take part in our real life, I mean,â€ she added softly,
with an indescribable coaxing of manner, as though she noticed his
shrinking. â€œYou will come back to us.â€

Already this slip of a child seemed to dominate him; he felt her power
coming over him more and more; something emanated from her that stole
over his senses and made him aware that her personality, for all its
simple grace, held forces that were stately, imposing, august. He saw
her again moving through smoke and flame amid broken and tempestuous
scenery, alarmingly strong, her terrible mother by her side. Dimly this
shone through her smile and appearance of charming innocence.

â€œYou will, I know,â€ she repeated, holding him with her eyes.

They were quite alone up there on the ramparts, and the sensation that
she was overmastering him stirred a wild sensuousness in his blood. The
mingled abandon and reserve in her attracted him furiously, and all of
him that was man rose up and resisted the creeping influence, at the
same time acclaiming it with the full delight of his forgotten youth.
An irresistible desire came to him to question her, to summon what
still remained to him of his own little personality in an effort to
retain the right to his normal self.

The girl had grown quiet again, and was now leaning on the broad wall
close beside him, gazing out across the darkening plain, her elbows on
the coping, motionless as a figure carved in stone. He took his courage
in both hands.

â€œTell me, IlsÃ©,â€ he said, unconsciously imitating her own purring
softness of voice, yet aware that he was utterly in earnest, â€œwhat is
the meaning of this town, and what is this real life you speak of? And
why is it that the people watch me from morning to night? Tell me what
it all means? And, tell me,â€ he added more quickly with passion in his
voice, â€œwhat you really are--yourself?â€

She turned her head and looked at him through half-closed eyelids, her
growing inner excitement betraying itself by the faint colour that ran
like a shadow across her face.

â€œIt seems to me,â€--he faltered oddly under her gaze--â€œthat I have some
right to know----â€

Suddenly she opened her eyes to the full. â€œYou love me, then?â€ she
asked softly.

â€œI swear,â€ he cried impetuously, moved as by the force of a rising
tide, â€œI never felt before--I have never known any other girl who----â€

â€œThen you _have_ the right to know,â€ she calmly interrupted his
confused confession; â€œfor love shares all secrets.â€

She paused, and a thrill like fire ran swiftly through him. Her words
lifted him off the earth, and he felt a radiant happiness, followed
almost the same instant in horrible contrast by the thought of death.
He became aware that she had turned her eyes upon his own and was
speaking again.

â€œThe real life I speak of,â€ she whispered, â€œis the old, old life
within, the life of long ago, the life to which you, too, once
belonged, and to which you still belong.â€

A faint wave of memory troubled the deeps of his soul as her low
voice sank into him. What she was saying he knew instinctively to be
true, even though he could not as yet understand its full purport.
His present life seemed slipping from him as he listened, merging his
personality in one that was far older and greater. It was this loss of
his present self that brought to him the thought of death.

â€œYou came here,â€ she went on, â€œwith the purpose of seeking it, and the
people felt your presence and are waiting to know what you decide,
whether you will leave them without having found it, or whether----â€

Her eyes remained fixed upon his own, but her face began to change,
growing larger and darker with an expression of age.

â€œIt is their thoughts constantly playing about your soul that makes
you feel they watch you. They do not watch you with their eyes. The
purposes of their inner life are calling to you, seeking to claim you.
You were all part of the same life long, long ago, and now they want
you back again among them.â€

Vezinâ€™s timid heart sank with dread as he listened; but the girlâ€™s
eyes held him with a net of joy so that he had no wish to escape. She
fascinated him, as it were, clean out of his normal self.

â€œAlone, however, the people could never have caught and held you,â€
she resumed. â€œThe motive force was not strong enough; it has faded
through all these years. But Iâ€--she paused a moment and looked at him
with complete confidence in her splendid eyes--â€œI possess the spell to
conquer you and hold you: the spell of old love. I can win you back
again and make you live the old life with me, for the force of the
ancient tie between us, if I choose to use it, is irresistible. And
I do choose to use it I still want you. And you, dear soul of my dim
pastâ€--she pressed closer to him so that her breath passed across his
eyes, and her voice positively sang--â€œI mean to have you, for you love
me and are utterly at my mercy.â€

Vezin heard, and yet did not hear; understood, yet did not understand.
He had passed into a condition of exaltation. The world was beneath his
feet, made of music and flowers, and he was flying somewhere far above
it through the sunshine of pure delight. He was breathless and giddy
with the wonder of her words. They intoxicated him. And, still, the
terror of it all, the dreadful thought of death, pressed ever behind
her sentences. For flames shot through her voice out of black smoke and
licked at his soul.

And they communicated with one another, it seemed to him, by a process
of swift telepathy, for his French could never have compassed all he
said to her. Yet she understood perfectly, and what she said to him was
like the recital of verses long since known. And the mingled pain and
sweetness of it as he listened were almost more than his little soul
could hold.

â€œYet I came here wholly by chance----â€ he heard himself saying.

â€œNo,â€ she cried with passion, â€œyou came here because I called to you. I
have called to you for years, and you came with the whole force of the
past behind you. You had to come, for I own you, and I claim you.â€

She rose again and moved closer, looking at him with a certain
insolence in the face--the insolence of power.

The sun had set behind the towers of the old cathedral and the darkness
rose up from the plain and enveloped them. The music of the band had
ceased. The leaves of the plane trees hung motionless, but the chill
of the autumn evening rose about them and made Vezin shiver. There
was no sound but the sound of their voices and the occasional soft
rustle of the girlâ€™s dress. He could hear the blood rushing in his
ears. He scarcely realised where he was or what he was doing. Some
terrible magic of the imagination drew him deeply down into the tombs
of his own being, telling him in no unfaltering voice that her words
shadowed forth the truth. And this simple little French maid, speaking
beside him with so strange authority, he saw curiously alter into quite
another being. As he stared into her eyes, the picture in his mind grew
and lived, dressing itself vividly to his inner vision with a degree
of reality he was compelled to acknowledge. As once before, he saw her
tall and stately, moving through wild and broken scenery of forests and
mountain caverns, the glare of flames behind her head and clouds of
shifting smoke about her feet. Dark leaves encircled her hair, flying
loosely in the wind, and her limbs shone through the merest rags of
clothing. Others were about her too, and ardent eyes on all sides cast
delirious glances upon her, but her own eyes were always for One only,
one whom she held by the hand. For she was leading the dance in some
tempestuous orgy to the music of chanting voices, and the dance she led
circled about a great and awful Figure on a throne, brooding over the
scene through lurid vapours, while innumerable other wild faces and
forms crowded furiously about her in the dance. But the one she held by
the hand he knew to be himself, and the monstrous shape upon the throne
he knew to be her mother.

The vision rose within him, rushing to him down the long years
of buried time, crying aloud to him with the voice of memory
reawakened.... And then the scene faded away and he saw the clear
circle of the girlâ€™s eyes gazing steadfastly into his own, and she
became once more the pretty little daughter of the innkeeper, and he
found his voice again.

â€œAnd you,â€ he whispered tremblingly--â€œyou child of visions and
enchantment, how is it that you so bewitch me that I loved you even
before I saw?â€

She drew herself up beside him with an air of rare dignity.

â€œThe call of the Past,â€ she said; â€œand besides,â€ she added proudly, â€œin
the real life I am a princess----â€

â€œA princess!â€ he cried.

â€œ----and my mother is a queen!â€

At this, little Vezin utterly lost his head. Delight tore at his heart
and swept him into sheer ecstasy. To hear that sweet singing voice, and
to see those adorable little lips utter such things, upset his balance
beyond all hope of control. He took her in his arms and covered her
unresisting face with kisses.

But even while he did so, and while the hot passion swept him, he
felt that she was soft and loathsome, and that her answering kisses
stained his very soul.... And when, presently, she had freed herself
and vanished into the darkness, he stood there, leaning against the
wall in a state of collapse, creeping with horror from the touch of
her yielding body, and inwardly raging at the weakness that he already
dimly realised must prove his undoing.

And from the shadows of the old buildings into which she disappeared
there rose in the stillness of the night a singular, long-drawn cry,
which at first he took for laughter, but which later he was sure he
recognised as the almost human wailing of a cat.


V

For a long time Vezin leant there against the wall, alone with his
surging thoughts and emotions. He understood at length that he had
done the one thing necessary to call down upon him the whole force of
this ancient Past. For in those passionate kisses he had acknowledged
the tie of olden days, and had revived it. And the memory of that soft
impalpable caress in the darkness of the inn corridor came back to him
with a shudder. The girl had first mastered him, and then led him to
the one act that was necessary for her purpose. He had been waylaid,
after the lapse of centuries--caught, and conquered.

Dimly he realised this, and sought to make plans for his escape. But,
for the moment at any rate, he was powerless to manage his thoughts or
will, for the sweet, fantastic madness of the whole adventure mounted
to his brain like a spell, and he gloried in the feeling that he was
utterly enchanted and moving in a world so much larger and wilder than
the one he had ever been accustomed to.

The moon, pale and enormous, was just rising over the sea-like plain,
when at last he rose to go. Her slanting rays drew all the houses into
new perspective, so that their roofs, already glistening with dew,
seemed to stretch much higher into the sky than usual, and their gables
and quaint old towers lay far away in its purple reaches.

The cathedral appeared unreal in a silver mist. He moved softly,
keeping to the shadows; but the streets were all deserted and very
silent; the doors were closed, the shutters fastened. Not a soul was
astir. The hush of night lay over everything; it was like a town of
the dead, a churchyard with gigantic and grotesque tombstones.

Wondering where all the busy life of the day had so utterly disappeared
to, he made his way to a back door that entered the inn by means of
the stables, thinking thus to reach his room unobserved. He reached
the courtyard safely and crossed it by keeping close to the shadow of
the wall. He sidled down it, mincing along on tiptoe, just as the old
men did when they entered the _salle Ã  manger_. He was horrified to
find himself doing this instinctively. A strange impulse came to him,
catching him somehow in the centre of his body--an impulse to drop upon
all fours and run swiftly and silently. He glanced upwards and the idea
came to him to leap up upon his window-sill overhead instead of going
round by the stairs. This occurred to him as the easiest, and most
natural way. It was like the beginning of some horrible transformation
of himself into something else. He was fearfully strung up.

The moon was higher now, and the shadows very dark along the side of
the street where he moved. He kept among the deepest of them, and
reached the porch with the glass doors.

But here there was light; the inmates, unfortunately, were still about.
Hoping to slip across the hall unobserved and reach the stairs, he
opened the door carefully and stole in. Then he saw that the hall was
not empty. A large dark thing lay against the wall on his left. At
first he thought it must be household articles. Then it moved, and he
thought it was an immense cat, distorted in some way by the play of
light and shadow. Then it rose straight up before him and he saw that
it was the proprietress.

What she had been doing in this position he could only venture a
dreadful guess, but the moment she stood up and faced him he was aware
of some terrible dignity clothing her about that instantly recalled the
girlâ€™s strange saying that she was a queen. Huge and sinister she stood
there under the little oil lamp; alone with him in the empty hall. Awe
stirred in his heart, and the roots of some ancient fear. He felt that
he must bow to her and make some kind of obeisance. The impulse was
fierce and irresistible, as of long habit. He glanced quickly about
him. There was no one there. Then he deliberately inclined his head
towards her. He bowed.

â€œEnfin! Mâ€™sieur sâ€™est donc dÃ©cidÃ©. Câ€™est bien alors. Jâ€™en suis
contente.â€

Her words came to him sonorously as through a great open space.

Then the great figure came suddenly across the flagged hall at him and
seized his trembling hands. Some overpowering force moved with her and
caught him.

â€œOn pourrait faire un pâ€™tit tour ensemble, nâ€™est-ce pas? Nous y allons
cette nuit et il faut sâ€™exercer un peu dâ€™avance pour cela. IlsÃ©, IlsÃ©,
viens donc ici. Viens vite!â€

And she whirled him round in the opening steps of some dance that
seemed oddly and horribly familiar. They made no sound on the stones,
this strangely assorted couple. It was all soft and stealthy. And
presently, when the air seemed to thicken like smoke, and a red glare
as of flame shot through it, he was aware that some one else had joined
them and that his hand the mother had released was now tightly held
by the daughter. IlsÃ© had come in answer to the call, and he saw her
with leaves of vervain twined in her dark hair, clothed in tattered
vestiges of some curious garment, beautiful as the night, and horribly,
odiously, loathsomely seductive.

â€œTo the Sabbath! to the Sabbath!â€ they cried. â€œOn to the Witchesâ€™
Sabbath!â€

Up and down that narrow hall they danced, the women on each side of
him, to the wildest measure he had ever imagined, yet which he dimly,
dreadfully remembered, till the lamp on the wall flickered and went
out, and they were left in total darkness. And the devil woke in his
heart with a thousand vile suggestions and made him afraid.

Suddenly they released his hands and he heard the voice of the mother
cry that it was time, and they must go. Which way they went he did
not pause to see. He only realised that he was free, and he blundered
through the darkness till he found the stairs and then tore up them to
his room as though all hell was at his heels.

He flung himself on the sofa, with his face in his hands, and groaned.
Swiftly reviewing a dozen ways of immediate escape, all equally
impossible, he finally decided that the only thing to do for the moment
was to sit quiet and wait. He must see what was going to happen. At
least in the privacy of his own bedroom he would be fairly safe. The
door was locked. He crossed over and softly opened the window which
gave upon the courtyard and also permitted a partial view of the hall
through the glass doors.

As he did so the hum and murmur of a great activity reached his ears
from the streets beyond--the sound of footsteps and voices muffled by
distance. He leaned out cautiously and listened. The moonlight was
clear and strong now, but his own window was in shadow, the silver
disc being still behind the house. It came to him irresistibly that
the inhabitants of the town, who a little while before had all been
invisible behind closed doors, were now issuing forth, busy upon some
secret and unholy errand. He listened intently.

At first everything about him was silent, but soon he became aware of
movements going on in the house itself. Rustlings and cheepings came
to him across that still, moonlit yard. A concourse of living beings
sent the hum of their activity into the night. Things were on the move
everywhere. A biting, pungent odour rose through the air, coming he
knew not whence. Presently his eyes became glued to the windows of
the opposite wall where the moonshine fell in a soft blaze. The roof
overhead, and behind him, was reflected clearly in the panes of glass,
and he saw the outlines of dark bodies moving with long footsteps over
the tiles and along the coping. They passed swiftly and silently,
shaped like immense cats, in an endless procession across the pictured
glass, and then appeared to leap down to a lower level where he lost
sight of them. He just caught the soft thudding of their leaps.
Sometimes their shadows fell upon the white wall opposite, and then
he could not make out whether they were the shadows of human beings
or of cats. They seemed to change swiftly from one to the other. The
transformation looked horribly real, for they leaped like human beings,
yet changed swiftly in the air immediately afterwards, and dropped like
animals.

The yard, too, beneath him, was now alive with the creeping movements
of dark forms all stealthily drawing towards the porch with the glass
doors. They kept so closely to the wall that he could not determine
their actual shape, but when he saw that they passed on to the great
congregation that was gathering in the hall, he understood that these
were the creatures whose leaping shadows he had first seen reflected in
the window-panes opposite. They were coming from all parts of the town,
reaching the appointed meeting-place across the roofs and tiles, and
springing from level to level till they came to the yard.

Then a new sound caught his ear, and he saw that the windows all about
him were being softly opened, and that to each window came a face. A
moment later figures began dropping hurriedly down into the yard. And
these figures, as they lowered themselves down from the windows, were
human, he saw; but once safely in the yard they fell upon all fours and
changed in the swiftest possible second into--cats--huge, silent cats.
They ran in streams to join the main body in the hall beyond.

So, after all, the rooms in the house had not been empty and unoccupied.

Moreover, what he saw no longer filled him with amazement. For he
remembered it all. It was familiar. It had all happened before just
so, hundreds of times, and he himself had taken part in it and known
the wild madness of it all. The outline of the old building changed,
the yard grew larger, and he seemed to be staring down upon it from
a much greater height through smoky vapours. And, as he looked, half
remembering, the old pains of long ago, fierce and sweet, furiously
assailed him, and the blood stirred horribly as he heard the Call of
the Dance again in his heart and tasted the ancient magic of IlsÃ©
whirling by his side.

Suddenly he started back. A great lithe cat had leaped softly up from
the shadows below on to the sill close to his face, and was staring
fixedly at him with the eyes of a human. â€œCome,â€ it seemed to say,
â€œcome with us to the Dance! Change as of old! Transform yourself
swiftly and come!â€ Only too well he understood the creatureâ€™s soundless
call.

It was gone again in a flash with scarcely a sound of its padded feet
on the stones, and then others dropped by the score down the side of
the house, past his very eyes, all changing as they fell and darting
away rapidly, softly, towards the gathering point. And again he felt
the dreadful desire to do likewise; to murmur the old incantation,
and then drop upon hands and knees and run swiftly for the great
flying leap into the air. Oh, how the passion of it rose within him
like a flood, twisting his very entrails, sending his heartâ€™s desire
flaming forth into the night for the old, old Dance of the Sorcerers
at the Witchesâ€™ Sabbath! The whirl of the stars was about him; once
more he met the magic of the moon. The power of the wind, rushing
from precipice and forest, leaping from cliff to cliff across the
valleys, tore him away.... He heard the cries of the dancers and their
wild laughter, and with this savage girl in his embrace he danced
furiously about the dim Throne where sate the Figure with the sceptre
of majesty....

Then, suddenly, all became hushed and still, and the fever died down a
little in his heart. The calm moonlight flooded a courtyard empty and
deserted. They had started. The procession was off into the sky. And he
was left behind--alone.

Vezin tiptoed softly across the room and unlocked the door. The murmur
from the streets, growing momentarily as he advanced, met his ears. He
made his way with the utmost caution down the corridor. At the head of
the stairs he paused and listened. Below him, the hall where they had
gathered was dark and still, but through opened doors and windows on
the far side of the building came the sound of a great throng moving
farther and farther into the distance.

He made his way down the creaking wooden stairs, dreading yet longing
to meet some straggler who should point the way, but finding no one;
across the dark hall, so lately thronged with living, moving things,
and out through the opened front doors into the street. He could not
believe that he was really left behind, really forgotten, that he had
been purposely permitted to escape. It perplexed him.

Nervously he peered about him, and up and down the street; then, seeing
nothing, advanced slowly down the pavement.

The whole town, as he went, showed itself empty and deserted, as
though a great wind had blown everything alive out of it. The doors
and windows of the houses stood open to the night; nothing stirred;
moonlight and silence lay over all. The night lay about him like a
cloak. The air, soft and cool, caressed his cheek like the touch of a
great furry paw. He gained confidence and began to walk quickly, though
still keeping to the shadowed side. Nowhere could he discover the
faintest sign of the great unholy exodus he knew had just taken place.
The moon sailed high over all in a sky, cloudless and serene.

Hardly realising where he was going, he crossed the open market-place
and so came to the ramparts, whence he knew a pathway descended to the
high road and along which he could make good his escape to one of the
other little towns that lay to the northward, and so to the railway.

But first he paused and gazed out over the scene at his feet where the
great plain lay like a silver map of some dream country. The still
beauty of it entered his heart, increasing his sense of bewilderment
and unreality. No air stirred, the leaves of the plane trees stood
motionless, the near details were defined with the sharpness of day
against dark shadows, and in the distance the fields and woods melted
away into haze and shimmering mistiness.

But the breath caught in his throat and he stood stockstill as though
transfixed when his gaze passed from the horizon and fell upon the near
prospect in the depth of the valley at his feet. The whole lower slopes
of the hill, that lay hid from the brightness of the moon, were aglow,
and through the glare he saw countless moving forms, shifting thick and
fast between the openings of the trees; while overhead, like leaves
driven by the wind, he discerned flying shapes that hovered darkly one
moment against the sky and then settled down with cries and weird
singing through the branches into the region that was aflame.

Spellbound, he stood and stared for a time that he could not measure.
And then, moved by one of the terrible impulses that seemed to control
the whole adventure, he climbed swiftly upon the top of the broad
coping, and balanced a moment where the valley gaped at his feet. But
in that very instant, as he stood hovering, a sudden movement among the
shadows of the houses caught his eye, and he turned to see the outline
of a large animal dart swiftly across the open space behind him, and
land with a flying leap upon the top of the wall a little lower down.
It ran like the wind to his feet and then rose up beside him upon the
ramparts. A shiver seemed to run through the moonlight, and his sight
trembled for a second. His heart pulsed fearfully. IlsÃ© stood beside
him, peering into his face.

Some dark substance, he saw, stained the girlâ€™s face and skin, shining
in the moonlight as she stretched her hands towards him; she was
dressed in wretched tattered garments that yet became her mightily; rue
and vervain twined about her temples; her eyes glittered with unholy
light. He only just controlled the wild impulse to take her in his arms
and leap with her from their giddy perch into the valley below.

â€œSee!â€ she cried, pointing with an arm on which the rags fluttered in
the rising wind towards the forest aglow in the distance. â€œSee where
they await us! The woods are alive! Already the Great Ones are there,
and the dance will soon begin! The salve is here! Anoint yourself and
come!â€

Though a moment before the sky was clear and cloudless, yet even while
she spoke the face of the moon grew dark and the wind began to toss
in the crests of the plane trees at his feet. Stray gusts brought the
sounds of hoarse singing and crying from the lower slopes of the hill,
and the pungent odour he had already noticed about the courtyard of the
inn rose about him in the air.

â€œTransform, transform!â€ she cried again, her voice rising like a song.
â€œRub well your skin before you fly. Come! Come with me to the Sabbath,
to the madness of its furious delight, to the sweet abandonment of
its evil worship! See! the Great Ones are there, and the terrible
Sacraments prepared. The Throne is occupied. Anoint and come! Anoint
and come!â€

She grew to the height of a tree beside him, leaping upon the wall with
flaming eyes and hair strewn upon the night. He too began to change
swiftly. Her hands touched the skin of his face and neck, streaking him
with the burning salve that sent the old magic into his blood with the
power before which fades all that is good.

A wild roar came up to his ears from the heart of the wood, and the
girl, when she heard it, leaped upon the wall in the frenzy of her
wicked joy.

â€œSatan is there!â€ she screamed, rushing upon him and striving to draw
him with her to the edge of the wall. â€œSatan has come! The Sacraments
call us! Come, with your dear apostate soul, and we will worship and
dance till the moon dies and the world is forgotten!â€

Just saving himself from the dreadful plunge, Vezin struggled to
release himself from her grasp, while the passion tore at his reins and
all but mastered him. He shrieked aloud, not knowing what he said, and
then he shrieked again. It was the old impulses, the old awful habits
instinctively finding voice; for though it seemed to him that he merely
shrieked nonsense, the words he uttered really had meaning in them, and
were intelligible. It was the ancient call. And it was heard below. It
was answered.

The wind whistled at the skirts of his coat as the air round him
darkened with many flying forms crowding upwards out of the valley. The
crying of hoarse voices smote upon his ears, coming closer. Strokes of
wind buffeted him, tearing him this way and that along the crumbling
top of the stone wall; and IlsÃ© clung to him with her long shining
arms, smooth and bare, holding him fast about the neck. But not IlsÃ©
alone, for a dozen of them surrounded him, dropping out of the air.
The pungent odour of the anointed bodies stifled him, exciting him to
the old madness of the Sabbath, the dance of the witches and sorcerers
doing honour to the personified Evil of the world.

â€œAnoint and away! Anoint and away!â€ they cried in wild chorus about
him. â€œTo the Dance that never dies! To the sweet and fearful fantasy of
evil!â€

Another moment and he would have yielded and gone, for his will turned
soft and the flood of passionate memory all but overwhelmed him,
when--so can a small thing alter the whole course of an adventure--he
caught his foot upon a loose stone in the edge of the wall, and
then fell with a sudden crash on to the ground below. But he fell
towards the houses, in the open space of dust and cobble stones, and
fortunately not into the gaping depth of the valley on the farther side.

And they, too, came in a tumbling heap about him, like flies upon a
piece of food, but as they fell he was released for a moment from
the power of their touch, and in that brief instant of freedom there
flashed into his mind the sudden intuition that saved him. Before he
could regain his feet he saw them scrabbling awkwardly back upon the
wall, as though bat-like they could only fly by dropping from a height,
and had no hold upon him in the open. Then, seeing them perched there
in a row like cats upon a roof, all dark and singularly shapeless,
their eyes like lamps, the sudden memory came back to him of IlsÃ©â€™s
terror at the sight of fire.

Quick as a flash he found his matches and lit the dead leaves that lay
under the wall.

Dry and withered, they caught fire at once, and the wind carried the
flame in a long line down the length of the wall, licking upwards as
it ran; and with shrieks and wailings, the crowded row of forms upon
the top melted away into the air on the other side, and were gone with
a great rush and whirring of their bodies down into the heart of the
haunted valley, leaving Vezin breathless and shaken in the middle of
the deserted ground.

â€œIlsÃ©!â€ he called feebly; â€œIlsÃ©!â€ for his heart ached to think that she
was really gone to the great Dance without him, and that he had lost
the opportunity of its fearful joy. Yet at the same time his relief
was so great, and he was so dazed and troubled in mind with the whole
thing, that he hardly knew what he was saying, and only cried aloud in
the fierce storm of his emotion....

The fire under the wall ran its course, and the moonlight came out
again, soft and clear, from its temporary eclipse. With one last
shuddering look at the ruined ramparts, and a feeling of horrid wonder
for the haunted valley beyond, where the shapes still crowded and flew,
he turned his face towards the town and slowly made his way in the
direction of the hotel.

And as he went, a great wailing of cries, and a sound of howling,
followed him from the gleaming forest below, growing fainter and
fainter with the bursts of wind as he disappeared between the houses.


VI

â€œIt may seem rather abrupt to you, this sudden tame ending,â€ said
Arthur Vezin, glancing with flushed face and timid eyes at Dr. Silence
sitting there with his notebook, â€œbut the fact is--er--from that moment
my memory seems to have failed rather. I have no distinct recollection
of how I got home or what precisely I did.

â€œIt appears I never went back to the inn at all. I only dimly recollect
racing down a long white road in the moonlight, past woods and
villages, still and deserted, and then the dawn came up, and I saw the
towers of a biggish town and so came to a station.

â€œBut, long before that, I remember pausing somewhere on the road and
looking back to where the hill-town of my adventure stood up in the
moonlight, and thinking how exactly like a great monstrous cat it lay
there upon the plain, its huge front paws lying down the two main
streets, and the twin and broken towers of the cathedral marking its
torn ears against the sky. That picture stays in my mind with the
utmost vividness to this day.

â€œAnother thing remains in my mind from that escape--namely, the sudden
sharp reminder that I had not paid my bill, and the decision I made,
standing there on the dusty highroad, that the small baggage I had left
behind would more than settle for my indebtedness.

â€œFor the rest, I can only tell you that I got coffee and bread at a
cafÃ© on the outskirts of this town I had come to, and soon after found
my way to the station and caught a train later in the day. That same
evening I reached London.â€

â€œAnd how long altogether,â€ asked John Silence quietly, â€œdo you think
you stayed in the town of the adventure?â€

Vezin looked up sheepishly.

â€œI was coming to that,â€ he resumed, with apologetic wrigglings of his
body. â€œIn London I found that I was a whole week out in my reckoning of
time. I had stayed over a week in the town, and it ought to have been
September 15th,--instead of which it was only September 10th!â€

â€œSo that, in reality, you had only stayed a night or two in the inn?â€
queried the doctor.

Vezin hesitated before replying. He shuffled upon the mat.

â€œI must have gained time somewhere,â€ he said at length--â€œsomewhere or
somehow. I certainly had a week to my credit. I canâ€™t explain it. I can
only give you the fact.â€

â€œAnd this happened to you last year, since when you have never been
back to the place?â€

â€œLast autumn, yes,â€ murmured Vezin; â€œand I have never dared to go
back. I think I never want to.â€

â€œAnd, tell me,â€ asked Dr. Silence at length, when he saw that the
little man had evidently come to the end of his words and had nothing
more to say, â€œhad you ever read up the subject of the old witchcraft
practices during the Middle Ages, or been at all interested in the
subject?â€

â€œNever!â€ declared Vezin emphatically. â€œI had never given a thought to
such matters so far as I know----â€

â€œOr to the question of reincarnation, perhaps?â€

â€œNever--before my adventure; but I have since,â€ he replied
significantly.

There was, however, something still on the manâ€™s mind that he wished
to relieve himself of by confession, yet could with difficulty bring
himself to mention; and it was only after the sympathetic tactfulness
of the doctor had provided numerous openings that he at length availed
himself of one of them, and stammered that he would like to show him
the marks he still had on his neck where, he said, the girl had touched
him with her anointed hands.

He took off his collar after infinite fumbling hesitation, and lowered
his shirt a little for the doctor to see. And there, on the surface of
the skin, lay a faint reddish line across the shoulder and extending
a little way down the back towards the spine. It certainly indicated
exactly the position an arm might have taken in the act of embracing.
And on the other side of the neck, slightly higher up, was a similar
mark, though not quite so clearly defined.

â€œThat was where she held me that night on the ramparts,â€ he whispered,
a strange light coming and going in his eyes.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was some weeks later when I again found occasion to consult John
Silence concerning another extraordinary case that had come under my
notice, and we fell to discussing Vezinâ€™s story. Since hearing it,
the doctor had made investigations on his own account, and one of his
secretaries had discovered that Vezinâ€™s ancestors had actually lived
for generations in the very town where the adventure came to him. Two
of them, both women, had been tried and convicted as witches, and had
been burned alive at the stake. Moreover, it had not been difficult to
prove that the very inn where Vezin stayed was built about 1700 upon
the spot where the funeral pyres stood and the executions took place.
The town was a sort of headquarters for all the sorcerers and witches
of the entire region, and after conviction they were burnt there
literally by scores.

â€œIt seems strange,â€ continued the doctor, â€œthat Vezin should have
remained ignorant of all this; but, on the other hand, it was not the
kind of history that successive generations would have been anxious to
keep alive, or to repeat to their children. Therefore I am inclined to
think he still knows nothing about it.

â€œThe whole adventure seems to have been a very vivid revival of the
memories of an earlier life, caused by coming directly into contact
with the living forces still intense enough to hang about the place,
and, by a most singular chance too, with the very souls who had taken
part with him in the events of that particular life. For the mother
and daughter who impressed him so strangely must have been leading
actors, with himself, in the scenes and practices of witchcraft which
at that period dominated the imaginations of the whole country.

â€œOne has only to read the histories of the times to know that
these witches claimed the power of transforming themselves into
various animals, both for the purposes of disguise and also to
convey themselves swiftly to the scenes of their imaginary orgies.
Lycanthropy, or the power to change themselves into wolves, was
everywhere believed in, and the ability to transform themselves into
cats by rubbing their bodies with a special salve or ointment provided
by Satan himself, found equal credence. The witchcraft trials abound in
evidences of such universal beliefs.â€

Dr. Silence quoted chapter and verse from many writers on the subject,
and showed how every detail of Vezinâ€™s adventure had a basis in the
practices of those dark days.

â€œBut that the entire affair took place subjectively in the manâ€™s own
consciousness, I have no doubt,â€ he went on, in reply to my questions;
â€œfor my secretary who has been to the town to investigate, discovered
his signature in the visitorsâ€™ book, and proved by it that he had
arrived on September 8th, and left suddenly without paying his bill.
He left two days later, and they still were in possession of his dirty
brown bag and some tourist clothes. I paid a few francs in settlement
of his debt, and have sent his luggage on to him. The daughter was
absent from home, but the proprietress, a large woman very much as he
described her, told my secretary that he had seemed a very strange,
absent-minded kind of gentleman, and after his disappearance she had
feared for a long time that he had met with a violent end in the
neighbouring forest where he used to roam about alone.

â€œI should like to have obtained a personal interview with the daughter
so as to ascertain how much was subjective and how much actually took
place with her as Vezin told it. For her dread of fire and the sight of
burning must, of course, have been the intuitive memory of her former
painful death at the stake, and have thus explained why he fancied more
than once that he saw her through smoke and flame.â€

â€œAnd that mark on his skin, for instance?â€ I inquired.

â€œMerely the marks produced by hysterical brooding,â€ he replied, â€œlike
the stigmata of the _religieuses_, and the bruises which appear on
the bodies of hypnotised subjects who have been told to expect them.
This is very common and easily explained. Only it seems curious that
these marks should have remained so long in Vezinâ€™s case. Usually they
disappear quickly.â€

â€œObviously he is still thinking about it all, brooding, and living it
all over again,â€ I ventured.

â€œProbably. And this makes me fear that the end of his trouble is not
yet. We shall hear of him again. It is a case, alas! I can do little to
alleviate.â€

Dr. Silence spoke gravely and with sadness in his voice.

â€œAnd what do you make of the Frenchman in the train?â€ I asked
further--â€œthe man who warned him against the place, _Ã  cause du sommeil
et Ã  cause des chats_? Surely a very singular incident?â€

â€œA _very_ singular incident indeed,â€ he made answer slowly, â€œand one I
can only explain on the basis of a highly improbable coincidence----â€

â€œNamely?â€

â€œThat the man was one who had himself stayed in the town and undergone
there a similar experience. I should like to find this man and ask him.
But the crystal is useless here, for I have no slightest clue to go
upon, and I can only conclude that some singular psychic affinity, some
force still active in his being out of the same past life, drew him
thus to the personality of Vezin, and enabled him to fear what might
happen to him, and thus to warn him as he did.

â€œYes,â€ he presently continued, half talking to himself, â€œI suspect in
this case that Vezin was swept into the vortex of forces arising out of
the intense activities of a past life, and that he lived over again a
scene in which he had often played a leading part centuries before. For
strong actions set up forces that are so slow to exhaust themselves,
they may be said in a sense never to die. In this case they were not
vital enough to render the illusion complete, so that the little man
found himself caught in a very distressing confusion of the present
and the past; yet he was sufficiently sensitive to recognise that it
was true, and to fight against the degradation of returning, even in
memory, to a former and lower state of development.

â€œAh yes!â€ he continued, crossing the floor to gaze at the darkening
sky, and seemingly quite oblivious of my presence, â€œsubliminal
up-rushes of memory like this can be exceedingly painful, and sometimes
exceedingly dangerous. I only trust that this gentle soul may soon
escape from this obsession of a passionate and tempestuous past. But I
doubt it, I doubt it.â€

His voice was hushed with sadness as he spoke, and when he turned back
into the room again there was an expression of profound yearning upon
his face, the yearning of a soul whose desire to help is sometimes
greater than his power.




CASE III

THE NEMESIS OF FIRE


I

By some means which I never could fathom, John Silence always contrived
to keep the compartment to himself, and as the train had a clear run
of two hours before the first stop, there was ample time to go over
the preliminary facts of the case. He had telephoned to me that very
morning, and even through the disguise of the miles of wire the thrill
of incalculable adventure had sounded in his voice.

â€œAs if it were an ordinary country visit,â€ he called, in reply to my
question; â€œand donâ€™t forget to bring your gun.â€

â€œWith blank cartridges, I suppose?â€ for I knew his rigid principles
with regard to the taking of life, and guessed that the guns were
merely for some obvious purpose of disguise.

Then he thanked me for coming, mentioned the train, snapped down the
receiver, and left me vibrating with the excitement of anticipation
to do my packing. For the honour of accompanying Dr. John Silence on
one of his big cases was what many would have considered an empty
honour--and risky. Certainly the adventure held all manner of
possibilities, and I arrived at Waterloo with the feelings of a man who
is about to embark on some dangerous and peculiar mission in which the
dangers he expects to run will not be the ordinary dangers to life and
limb, but of some secret character difficult to name and still more
difficult to cope with.

â€œThe Manor House has a high sound,â€ he told me, as we sat with our
feet up and talked, â€œbut I believe it is little more than an overgrown
farmhouse in the desolate heather country beyond D----, and its owner,
Colonel Wragge, a retired soldier with a taste for books, lives there
practically alone, I understand, with an elderly invalid sister. So you
need not look forward to a lively visit, unless the case provides some
excitement of its own.â€

â€œWhich is likely?â€

By way of reply he handed me a letter marked â€œPrivate.â€ It was dated a
week ago, and signed â€œYours faithfully, Horace Wragge.â€

â€œHe heard of me, you see, through Captain Anderson,â€ the doctor
explained modestly, as though his fame were not almost world-wide; â€œyou
remember that Indian obsession case----â€

I read the letter. Why it should have been marked private was difficult
to understand. It was very brief, direct, and to the point. It referred
by way of introduction to Captain Anderson, and then stated quite
simply that the writer needed help of a peculiar kind and asked for a
personal interview--a morning interview, since it was impossible for
him to be absent from the house at night. The letter was dignified
even to the point of abruptness, and it is difficult to explain how
it managed to convey to me the impression of a strong man, shaken
and perplexed. Perhaps the restraint of the wording, and the mystery
of the affair had something to do with it; and the reference to the
Anderson case, the horror of which lay still vivid in my memory, may
have touched the sense of something rather ominous and alarming. But,
whatever the cause, there was no doubt that an impression of serious
peril rose somehow out of that white paper with the few lines of firm
writing, and the spirit of a deep uneasiness ran between the words and
reached the mind without any visible form of expression.

â€œAnd when you saw him----?â€ I asked, returning the letter as the train
rushed clattering noisily through Clapham Junction.

â€œI have not seen him,â€ was the reply. â€œThe manâ€™s mind was charged to
the brim when he wrote that; full of vivid mental pictures. Notice
the restraint of it. For the main character of his case psychometry
could be depended upon, and the scrap of paper his hand has touched
is sufficient to give to another mind--a sensitive and sympathetic
mind--clear mental pictures of what is going on. I think I have a very
sound general idea of his problem.â€

â€œSo there may be excitement after all?â€

John Silence waited a moment before he replied.

â€œSomething very serious is amiss there,â€ he said gravely, at length.
â€œSome one--not himself, I gather,--has been meddling with a rather
dangerous kind of gunpowder. So--yes, there may be excitement, as you
put it.â€

â€œAnd my duties?â€ I asked, with a decidedly growing interest. â€œRemember,
I am your â€˜assistant.â€™â€

â€œBehave like an intelligent confidential secretary. Observe everything,
without seeming to. Say nothing--nothing that means anything. Be
present at all interviews. I may ask a good deal of you, for if my
impressions are correct this is----â€

He broke off suddenly.

â€œBut I wonâ€™t tell you my impressions yet,â€ he resumed after a momentâ€™s
thought. â€œJust watch and listen as the case proceeds. Form your
own impressions and cultivate your intuitions. We come as ordinary
visitors, of course,â€ he added, a twinkle showing for an instant in his
eye; â€œhence, the guns.â€

Though disappointed not to hear more, I recognised the wisdom of
his words and knew how valueless my impressions would be once the
powerful suggestion of having heard his own lay behind them. I likewise
reflected that intuition joined to a sense of humour was of more use to
a man than double the quantity of mere â€œbrains,â€ as such.

Before putting the letter away, however, he handed it back, telling me
to place it against my forehead for a few moments and then describe any
pictures that came spontaneously into my mind.

â€œDonâ€™t deliberately look for anything. Just imagine you see the inside
of the eyelid, and wait for pictures that rise against its dark screen.â€

I followed his instructions, making my mind as nearly a blank as
possible. But no visions came. I saw nothing but the lines of light
that pass to and fro like the changes of a kaleidoscope across the
blackness. A momentary sensation of warmth came and went curiously.

â€œYou see--what?â€ he asked presently.

â€œNothing,â€ I was obliged to admit disappointedly; â€œnothing but the
usual flashes of light one always sees. Only, perhaps, they are more
vivid than usual.â€

He said nothing by way of comment or reply.

â€œAnd they group themselves now and then,â€ I continued, with painful
candour, for I longed to see the pictures he had spoken of, â€œgroup
themselves into globes and round balls of fire, and the lines that
flash about sometimes look like triangles and crosses--almost like
geometrical figures. Nothing more.â€

I opened my eyes again, and gave him back the letter.

â€œIt makes my head hot,â€ I said, feeling somehow unworthy for not seeing
anything of interest. But the look in his eyes arrested my attention at
once.

â€œThat sensation of heat is important,â€ he said significantly.

â€œIt was certainly real, and rather uncomfortable,â€ I replied, hoping
he would expand and explain. â€œThere was a distinct feeling of
warmth--internal warmth somewhere--oppressive in a sense.â€

â€œThat is interesting,â€ he remarked, putting the letter back in his
pocket, and settling himself in the corner with newspapers and books.
He vouchsafed nothing more, and I knew the uselessness of trying to
make him talk. Following his example I settled likewise with magazines
into my corner. But when I closed my eyes again to look for the
flashing lights and the sensation of heat, I found nothing but the
usual phantasmagoria of the dayâ€™s events--faces, scenes, memories,--and
in due course I fell asleep and then saw nothing at all of any kind.

When we left the train, after six hoursâ€™ travelling, at a little
wayside station standing without trees in a world of sand and heather,
the late October shadows had already dropped their sombre veil upon the
landscape, and the sun dipped almost out of sight behind the moorland
hills. In a high dogcart, behind a fast horse, we were soon rattling
across the undulating stretches of an open and bleak country, the keen
air stinging our cheeks and the scents of pine and bracken strong
about us. Bare hills were faintly visible against the horizon, and the
coachman pointed to a bank of distant shadows on our left where he told
us the sea lay. Occasional stone farmhouses, standing back from the
road among straggling fir trees, and large black barns that seemed to
shift past us with a movement of their own in the gloom, were the only
signs of humanity and civilisation that we saw, until at the end of a
bracing five miles the lights of the lodge gates flared before us and
we plunged into a thick grove of pine trees that concealed the Manor
House up to the moment of actual arrival.

Colonel Wragge himself met us in the hall. He was the typical army
officer who had seen service, real service, and found himself in the
process. He was tall and well built, broad in the shoulders, but lean
as a greyhound, with grave eyes, rather stern, and a moustache turning
grey. I judged him to be about sixty years of age, but his movements
showed a suppleness of strength and agility that contradicted the
years. The face was full of character and resolution, the face of a man
to be depended upon, and the straight grey eyes, it seemed to me, wore
a veil of perplexed anxiety that he made no attempt to disguise. The
whole appearance of the man at once clothed the adventure with gravity
and importance. A matter that gave such a man cause for serious alarm,
I felt, must be something real and of genuine moment.

His speech and manner, as he welcomed us, were like his letter, simple
and sincere. He had a nature as direct and undeviating as a bullet.
Thus, he showed plainly his surprise that Dr. Silence had not come
alone.

â€œMy confidential secretary, Mr. Hubbard,â€ the doctor said, introducing
me, and the steady gaze and powerful shake of the hand I then
received were well calculated, I remember thinking, to drive home the
impression that here was a man who was not to be trifled with, and
whose perplexity must spring from some very real and tangible cause.
And, quite obviously, he was relieved that we had come. His welcome was
unmistakably genuine.

He led us at once into a room, half library, half smoking-room,
that opened out of the low-ceilinged hall. The Manor House gave the
impression of a rambling and glorified farmhouse, solid, ancient,
comfortable, and wholly unpretentious. And so it was. Only the heat of
the place struck me as unnatural. This room with the blazing fire may
have seemed uncomfortably warm after the long drive through the night
air; yet it seemed to me that the hall itself, and the whole atmosphere
of the house, breathed a warmth that hardly belonged to well-filled
grates or the pipes of hot air and water. It was not the heat of the
greenhouse; it was an oppressive heat that somehow got into the head
and mind. It stirred a curious sense of uneasiness in me, and I caught
myself thinking of the sensation of warmth that had emanated from the
letter in the train.

I heard him thanking Dr. Silence for having come; there was no
preamble, and the exchange of civilities was of the briefest
description. Evidently here was a man who, like my companion, loved
action rather than talk. His manner was straightforward and direct. I
saw him in a flash: puzzled, worried, harassed into a state of alarm by
something he could not comprehend; forced to deal with things he would
have preferred to despise, yet facing it all with dogged seriousness
and making no attempt to conceal that he felt secretly ashamed of his
incompetence.

â€œSo I cannot offer you much entertainment beyond that of my own
company, and the queer business that has been going on here, and is
still going on,â€ he said, with a slight inclination of the head towards
me by way of including me in his confidence.

â€œI think, Colonel Wragge,â€ replied John Silence impressively, â€œthat we
shall none of us find the time hang heavy. I gather we shall have our
hands full.â€

The two men looked at one another for the space of some seconds, and
there was an indefinable quality in their silence which for the first
time made me admit a swift question into my mind; and I wondered a
little at my rashness in coming with so little reflection into a big
case of this incalculable doctor. But no answer suggested itself, and
to withdraw was, of course, inconceivable. The gates had closed behind
me now, and the spirit of the adventure was already besieging my mind
with its advance guard of a thousand little hopes and fears.

Explaining that he would wait till after dinner to discuss anything
serious, as no reference was ever made before his sister, he led the
way upstairs and showed us personally to our rooms; and it was just as
I was finishing dressing that a knock came at my door and Dr. Silence
entered.

He was always what is called a serious man, so that even in moments of
comedy you felt he never lost sight of the profound gravity of life,
but as he came across the room to me I caught the expression of his
face and understood in a flash that he was now in his most grave and
earnest mood. He looked almost troubled. I stopped fumbling with my
black tie and stared.

â€œIt _is_ serious,â€ he said, speaking in a low voice, â€œmore so even than
I imagined. Colonel Wraggeâ€™s control over his thoughts concealed a
great deal in my psychometrising of the letter. I looked in to warn you
to keep yourself well in hand--generally speaking.â€

â€œHaunted house?â€ I asked, conscious of a distinct shiver down my back.

But he smiled gravely at the question.

â€œHaunted House of Life more likely,â€ he replied, and a look came into
his eyes which I had only seen there when a human soul was in the toils
and he was thick in the fight of rescue. He was stirred in the deeps.

â€œColonel Wragge--or the sister?â€ I asked hurriedly, for the gong was
sounding.

â€œNeither directly,â€ he said from the door. â€œSomething far older,
something very, very remote indeed. This thing has to do with the ages,
unless I am mistaken greatly, the ages on which the mists of memory
have long lain undisturbed.â€

He came across the floor very quickly with a finger on his lips,
looking at me with a peculiar searchingness of gaze.

â€œAre you aware yet of anything--odd here?â€ he asked in a whisper.
â€œAnything you cannot quite define, for instance. Tell me, Hubbard, for
I want to know all your impressions. They may help me.â€

I shook my head, avoiding his gaze, for there was something in the eyes
that scared me a little. But he was so in earnest that I set my mind
keenly searching.

â€œNothing yet,â€ I replied truthfully, wishing I could confess to a real
emotion; â€œnothing but the strange heat of the place.â€

He gave a little jump forward in my direction.

â€œThe heat again, thatâ€™s it!â€ he exclaimed, as though glad of my
corroboration. â€œAnd how would you describe it, perhaps?â€ he asked
quickly, with a hand on the door knob.

â€œIt doesnâ€™t seem like ordinary physical heat,â€ I said, casting about in
my thoughts for a definition.

â€œMore a mental heat,â€ he interrupted, â€œa glowing of thought and desire,
a sort of feverish warmth of the spirit. Isnâ€™t that it?â€

I admitted that he had exactly described my sensations.

â€œGood!â€ he said, as he opened the door, and with an indescribable
gesture that combined a warning to be ready with a sign of praise for
my correct intuition, he was gone.

I hurried after him, and found the two men waiting for me in front of
the fire.

â€œI ought to warn you,â€ our host was saying as I came in, â€œthat my
sister, whom you will meet at dinner, is not aware of the real object
of your visit. She is under the impression that we are interested in
the same line of study--folklore--and that your researches have led to
my seeking acquaintance. She comes to dinner in her chair, you know. It
will be a great pleasure to her to meet you both. We have few visitors.â€

So that on entering the dining-room we were prepared to find Miss
Wragge already at her place, seated in a sort of bath-chair. She was
a vivacious and charming old lady, with smiling expression and bright
eyes, and she chatted all through dinner with unfailing spontaneity.
She had that face, unlined and fresh, that some people carry through
life from the cradle to the grave; her smooth plump cheeks were
all pink and white, and her hair, still dark, was divided into two
glossy and sleek halves on either side of a careful parting. She wore
gold-rimmed glasses, and at her throat was a large scarab of green
jasper that made a very handsome brooch.

Her brother and Dr. Silence talked little, so that most of the
conversation was carried on between herself and me, and she told me a
great deal about the history of the old house, most of which I fear I
listened to with but half an ear.

â€œAnd when Cromwell stayed here,â€ she babbled on, â€œhe occupied the very
rooms upstairs that used to be mine. But my brother thinks it safer for
me to sleep on the ground floor now in case of fire.â€

And this sentence has stayed in my memory only because of the sudden
way her brother interrupted her and instantly led the conversation
on to another topic. The passing reference to fire seemed to have
disturbed him, and thenceforward he directed the talk himself.

It was difficult to believe that this lively and animated old lady,
sitting beside me and taking so eager an interest in the affairs of
life, was practically, we understood, without the use of her lower
limbs, and that her whole existence for years had been passed between
the sofa, the bed, and the bath-chair in which she chatted so naturally
at the dinner-table. She made no allusion to her affliction until the
dessert was reached, and then, touching a bell, she made us a witty
little speech about leaving us â€œlike time, on noiseless feet,â€ and was
wheeled out of the room by the butler and carried off to her apartments
at the other end of the house.

And the rest of us were not long in following suit, for Dr. Silence and
myself were quite as eager to learn the nature of our errand as our
host was to impart it to us. He led us down a long flagged passage to a
room at the very end of the house, a room provided with double doors,
and windows, I saw, heavily shuttered. Books lined the walls on every
side, and a large desk in the bow window was piled up with volumes,
some open, some shut, some showing scraps of paper stuck between the
leaves, and all smothered in a general cataract of untidy foolscap and
loose half sheets.

â€œMy study and workroom,â€ explained Colonel Wragge, with a delightful
touch of innocent pride, as though he were a very serious scholar.
He placed arm-chairs for us round the fire. â€œHere,â€ he added
significantly, â€œwe shall be safe from interruption and can talk
securely.â€

During dinner the manner of the doctor had been all that was natural
and spontaneous, though it was impossible for me, knowing him as I
did, not to be aware that he was subconsciously very keenly alert and
already receiving upon the ultra-sensitive surface of his mind various
and vivid impressions; and there was now something in the gravity
of his face, as well as in the significant tone of Colonel Wraggeâ€™s
speech, and something, too, in the fact that we three were shut away in
this private chamber about to listen to things probably strange, and
certainly mysterious--something in all this that touched my imagination
sharply and sent an undeniable thrill along my nerves. Taking the chair
indicated by my host, I lit my cigar and waited for the opening of the
attack, fully conscious that we were now too far gone in the adventure
to admit of withdrawal, and wondering a little anxiously where it was
going to lead.

What I expected precisely, it is hard to say. Nothing definite,
perhaps. Only the sudden change was dramatic. A few hours before the
prosaic atmosphere of Piccadilly was about me, and now I was sitting in
a secret chamber of this remote old building waiting to hear an account
of things that held possibly the genuine heart of terror. I thought of
the dreary moors and hills outside, and the dark pine copses soughing
in the wind of night; I remembered my companionâ€™s singular words up in
my bedroom before dinner; and then I turned and noted carefully the
stern countenance of the Colonel as he faced us and lit his big black
cigar before speaking.

The threshold of an adventure, I reflected as I waited for the first
words, is always the most thrilling moment--until the climax comes.

But Colonel Wragge hesitated--mentally--a long time before he began.
He talked briefly of our journey, the weather, the country, and other
comparatively trivial topics, while he sought about in his mind for an
appropriate entry into the subject that was uppermost in the thoughts
of all of us. The fact was he found it a difficult matter to speak of
at all, and it was Dr. Silence who finally showed him the way over the
hedge.

â€œMr Hubbard will take a few notes when you are ready--you wonâ€™t
object,â€ he suggested; â€œI can give my undivided attention in this way.â€

â€œBy all means,â€ turning to reach some of the loose sheets on the
writing table, and glancing at me. He still hesitated a little, I
thought. â€œThe fact is,â€ he said apologetically, â€œI wondered if it
was quite fair to trouble you so soon. The daylight might suit you
better to hear what I have to tell. Your sleep, I mean, might be less
disturbed, perhaps.â€

â€œI appreciate your thoughtfulness,â€ John Silence replied with his
gentle smile, taking command as it were from that moment, â€œbut really
we are both quite immune. There is nothing, I think, that could prevent
either of us sleeping, except--an outbreak of fire, or some such very
physical disturbance.â€

Colonel Wragge raised his eyes and looked fixedly at him. This
reference to an outbreak of fire I felt sure was made with a purpose.
It certainly had the desired effect of removing from our hostâ€™s manner
the last signs of hesitancy.

â€œForgive me,â€ he said. â€œOf course, I know nothing of your methods in
matters of this kind--so, perhaps, you would like me to begin at once
and give you an outline of the situation?â€

Dr. Silence bowed his agreement. â€œI can then take my precautions
accordingly,â€ he added calmly.

The soldier looked up for a moment as though he did not quite gather
the meaning of these words; but he made no further comment and
turned at once to tackle a subject on which he evidently talked with
diffidence and unwillingness.

â€œItâ€™s all so utterly out of my line of things,â€ he began, puffing out
clouds of cigar smoke between his words, â€œand thereâ€™s so little to tell
with any real evidence behind it, that itâ€™s almost impossible to make
a consecutive story for you. Itâ€™s the total cumulative effect that is
so--so disquieting.â€ He chose his words with care, as though determined
not to travel one hairâ€™s breadth beyond the truth.

â€œI came into this place twenty years ago when my elder brother died,â€
he continued, â€œbut could not afford to live here then. My sister, whom
you met at dinner, kept house for him till the end, and during all
these years, while I was seeing service abroad, she had an eye to the
place--for we never got a satisfactory tenant--and saw that it was not
allowed to go to ruin. I myself took possession, however, only a year
ago.

â€œMy brother,â€ he went on, after a perceptible pause, â€œspent much of
his time away, too. He was a great traveller, and filled the house
with stuff he brought home from all over the world. The laundry--a
small detached building beyond the servantsâ€™ quarters--he turned into a
regular little museum. The curios and things I have cleared away--they
collected dust and were always getting broken--but the laundry-house
you shall see tomorrow.â€

Colonel Wragge spoke with such deliberation and with so many pauses
that this beginning took him a long time. But at this point he came to
a full stop altogether. Evidently there was something he wished to say
that cost him considerable effort. At length he looked up steadily into
my companionâ€™s face.

â€œMay I ask you--that is, if you wonâ€™t think it strange,â€ he said, and a
sort of hush came over his voice and manner, â€œwhether you have noticed
anything at all unusual--anything queer, since you came into the house?â€

Dr. Silence answered without a momentâ€™s hesitation.

â€œI have,â€ he said. â€œThere is a curious sensation of heat in the place.â€

â€œAh!â€ exclaimed the other, with a slight start. â€œYou _have_ noticed it.
This unaccountable heat----â€

â€œBut its cause, I gather, is not in the house itself--but outside,â€ I
was astonished to hear the doctor add.

Colonel Wragge rose from his chair and turned to unhook a framed map
that hung upon the wall. I got the impression that the movement was
made with the deliberate purpose of concealing his face.

â€œYour diagnosis, I believe, is amazingly accurate,â€ he said after a
moment, turning round with the map in his hands. â€œThough, of course, I
can have no idea how you should guess----â€

John Silence shrugged his shoulders expressively. â€œMerely my
impression,â€ he said. â€œIf you pay attention to impressions, and do not
allow them to be confused by deductions of the intellect, you will
often find them surprisingly, uncannily, accurate.â€

Colonel Wragge resumed his seat and laid the map upon his knees. His
face was very thoughtful as he plunged abruptly again into his story.

â€œOn coming into possession,â€ he said, looking us alternately in
the face, â€œI found a crop of stories of the most extraordinary and
impossible kind I had ever heard--stories which at first I treated with
amused indifference, but later was forced to regard seriously, if only
to keep my servants. These stories I thought I traced to the fact of my
brotherâ€™s death--and, in a way, I think so still.â€

He leant forward and handed the map to Dr. Silence.

â€œItâ€™s an old plan of the estate,â€ he explained, â€œbut accurate enough
for our purpose, and I wish you would note the position of the
plantations marked upon it, especially those near the house. That
one,â€ indicating the spot with his finger, â€œis called the Twelve Acre
Plantation. It was just there, on the side nearest the house, that my
brother and the head keeper met their deaths.â€

He spoke as a man forced to recognise facts that he deplored, and would
have preferred to leave untouched--things he personally would rather
have treated with ridicule if possible. It made his words peculiarly
dignified and impressive, and I listened with an increasing uneasiness
as to the sort of help the doctor would look to me for later. It seemed
as though I were a spectator of some drama of mystery in which any
moment I might be summoned to play a part.

â€œIt was twenty years ago,â€ continued the Colonel, â€œbut there was much
talk about it at the time, unfortunately, and you may, perhaps, have
heard of the affair. Stride, the keeper, was a passionate, hot-tempered
man, but I regret to say, so was my brother, and quarrels between them
seem to have been frequent.â€

â€œI do not recall the affair,â€ said the doctor. â€œMay I ask what was the
cause of death?â€ Something in his voice made me prick up my ears for
the reply.

â€œThe keeper, it was said, from suffocation. And at the inquest the
doctors averred that both men had been dead the same length of time
when found.â€

â€œAnd your brother?â€ asked John Silence, noticing the omission, and
listening intently.

â€œEqually mysterious,â€ said our host, speaking in a low voice with
effort. â€œBut there was one distressing feature I think I ought to
mention. For those who saw the face--I did not see it myself--and
though Stride carried a gun its chambers were undischarged----â€ He
stammered and hesitated with confusion. Again that sense of terror
moved between his words. He stuck.

â€œYes,â€ said the chief listener sympathetically.

â€œMy brotherâ€™s face, they said, looked as though it had been scorched.
It had been swept, as it were, by something that burned--blasted. It
was, I am told, quite dreadful. The bodies were found lying side by
side, faces downwards, both pointing away from the wood, as though they
had been in the act of running, and not more than a dozen yards from
its edge.â€

Dr. Silence made no comment. He appeared to be studying the map
attentively.

â€œI did not see the face myself,â€ repeated the other, his manner somehow
expressing the sense of awe he contrived to keep out of his voice,
â€œbut my sister unfortunately did, and her present state I believe to
be entirely due to the shock it gave to her nerves. She never can be
brought to refer to it, naturally, and I am even inclined to think that
the memory has mercifully been permitted to vanish from her mind. But
she spoke of it at the time as a face swept by flame--blasted.â€

John Silence looked up from his contemplation of the map, but with the
air of one who wished to listen, not to speak, and presently Colonel
Wragge went on with his account. He stood on the mat, his broad
shoulders hiding most of the mantelpiece.

â€œThey all centred about this particular plantation, these stories. That
was to be expected, for the people here are as superstitious as Irish
peasantry, and though I made one or two examples among them to stop the
foolish talk, it had no effect, and new versions came to my ears every
week. You may imagine how little good dismissals did, when I tell you
that the servants dismissed themselves. It was not the house servants,
but the men who worked on the estate outside. The keepers gave notice
one after another, none of them with any reason I could accept; the
foresters refused to enter the wood, and the beaters to beat in it.
Word flew all over the countryside that Twelve Acre Plantation was a
place to be avoided, day or night.

â€œThere came a point,â€ the Colonel went on, now well in his swing, â€œwhen
I felt compelled to make investigations on my own account. I could
not kill the thing by ignoring it; so I collected and analysed the
stories at first hand. For this Twelve Acre Wood, you will see by the
map, comes rather near home. Its lower end, if you will look, almost
touches the end of the back lawn, as I will show you tomorrow, and its
dense growth of pines forms the chief protection the house enjoys from
the east winds that blow up from the sea. And in olden days, before my
brother interfered with it and frightened all the game away, it was one
of the best pheasant coverts on the whole estate.â€

â€œAnd what form, if I may ask, did this interference take?â€ asked Dr.
Silence.

â€œIn detail, I cannot tell you, for I do not know--except that I
understand it was the subject of his frequent differences with the head
keeper; but during the last two years of his life, when he gave up
travelling and settled down here, he took a special interest in this
wood, and for some unaccountable reason began to build a low stone wall
round it. This wall was never finished, but you shall see the ruins
tomorrow in the daylight.â€

â€œAnd the result of your investigations--these stories, I mean?â€ the
doctor broke in, anxious to keep him to the main issues.

â€œYes, Iâ€™m coming to that,â€ he said slowly, â€œbut the wood first, for
this wood out of which they grew like mushrooms has nothing in any way
peculiar about it. It is very thickly grown, and rises to a clearer
part in the centre, a sort of mound where there is a circle of large
boulders--old Druid stones, Iâ€™m told. At another place thereâ€™s a small
pond. Thereâ€™s nothing distinctive about it that I could mention--just
an ordinary pine-wood, a very ordinary pine-wood--only the trees are a
bit twisted in the trunks, some of â€™em, and very dense. Nothing more.

â€œAnd the stories? Well, none of them had anything to do with my poor
brother, or the keeper, as you might have expected; and they were all
odd--such odd things, I mean, to invent or imagine. I never could make
out how these people got such notions into their heads.â€

He paused a moment to relight his cigar.

â€œThereâ€™s no regular path through it,â€ he resumed, puffing vigorously,
â€œbut the fields round it are constantly used, and one of the gardeners
whose cottage lies over that way declared he often saw moving lights in
it at night, and luminous shapes like globes of fire over the tops of
the trees, skimming and floating, and making a soft hissing sound--most
of â€™em said that, in fact--and another man saw shapes flitting in and
out among the trees, things that were neither men nor animals, and all
faintly luminous. No one ever pretended to see human forms--always
queer, huge things they could not properly describe. Sometimes the
whole wood was lit up, and one fellow--heâ€™s still here and you shall
see him--has a most circumstantial yarn about having seen great stars
lying on the ground round the edge of the wood at regular intervals----â€

â€œWhat kind of stars?â€ put in John Silence sharply, in a sudden way that
made me start.

â€œOh, I donâ€™t know quite; ordinary stars, I think he said, only very
large, and apparently blazing as though the ground was alight. He was
too terrified to go close and examine, and he has never seen them
since.â€

He stooped and stirred the fire into a welcome blaze--welcome for its
blaze of light rather than for its heat. In the room there was already
a strange pervading sensation of warmth that was oppressive in its
effect and far from comforting.

â€œOf course,â€ he went on, straightening up again on the mat, â€œthis was
all commonplace enough--this seeing lights and figures at night. Most
of these fellows drink, and imagination and terror between them may
account for almost anything. But others saw things in broad daylight.
One of the woodmen, a sober, respectable man, took the shortcut home to
his midday meal, and swore he was followed the whole length of the wood
by something that never showed itself, but dodged from tree to tree,
always keeping out of sight, yet solid enough to make the branches sway
and the twigs snap on the ground. And it made a noise, he declared--but
reallyâ€--the speaker stopped and gave a short laugh--â€œitâ€™s too
absurd----â€

â€œ_Please!_â€ insisted the doctor; â€œfor it is these small details that
give me the best clues always.â€

â€œ----it made a crackling noise, he said, like a bonfire. Those were his
very words: like the crackling of a bonfire,â€ finished the soldier,
with a repetition of his short laugh.

â€œMost interesting,â€ Dr. Silence observed gravely. â€œPlease omit nothing.â€

â€œYesâ€ he went on, â€œand it was soon after that the fires began--the
fires in the wood. They started mysteriously burning in the patches of
coarse white grass that cover the more open parts of the plantation. No
one ever actually saw them start, but many, myself among the number,
have seen them burning and smouldering. They are always small and
circular in shape, and for all the world like a picnic fire. The head
keeper has a dozen explanations, from sparks flying out of the house
chimneys to the sunlight focusing through a dewdrop, but none of them,
I must admit, convince me as being in the least likely or probable.
They are most singular, I consider, most singular, these mysterious
fires, and I am glad to say that they come only at rather long
intervals and never seem to spread.

â€œBut the keeper had other queer stories as well, and about things that
are verifiable. He declared that no life ever willingly entered the
plantation; more, that no life existed in it at all. No birds nested in
the trees, or flew into their shade. He set countless traps, but never
caught so much as a rabbit or a weasel. Animals avoided it, and more
than once he had picked up dead creatures round the edges that bore no
obvious signs of how they had met their death.

â€œMoreover, he told me one extraordinary tale about his retriever
chasing some invisible creature across the field one day when he was
out with his gun. The dog suddenly pointed at something in the field at
his feet, and then gave chase, yelping like a mad thing. It followed
its imaginary quarry to the borders of the wood, and then went in--a
thing he had never known it to do before. The moment it crossed the
edge--it is darkish in there even in daylight--it began fighting
in the most frenzied and terrific fashion. It made him afraid to
interfere, he said. And at last, when the dog came out, hanging its
tail down and panting, he found something like white hair stuck to its
jaws, and brought it to show me. I tell you these details because----â€

â€œThey are important, believe me,â€ the doctor stopped him. â€œAnd you have
it still, this hair?â€ he asked.

â€œIt disappeared in the oddest way,â€ the Colonel explained. â€œIt was
curious looking stuff, something like asbestos, and I sent it to be
analysed by the local chemist. But either the man got wind of its
origin, or else he didnâ€™t like the look of it for some reason, because
he returned it to me and said it was neither animal, vegetable, nor
mineral, so far as he could make out, and he didnâ€™t wish to have
anything to do with it. I put it away in paper, but a week later, on
opening the package--it was gone! Oh, the stories are simply endless. I
could tell you hundreds all on the same lines.â€

â€œAnd personal experiences of your own, Colonel Wragge?â€ asked John
Silence earnestly, his manner showing the greatest possible interest
and sympathy.

The soldier gave an almost imperceptible start. He looked distinctly
uncomfortable.

â€œNothing, I think,â€ he said slowly, â€œnothing--er--I should like to rely
on. I mean nothing I have the right to speak of, perhaps--yet.â€

His mouth closed with a snap. Dr. Silence, after waiting a little to
see if he would add to his reply, did not seek to press him on the
point.

â€œWell,â€ he resumed presently, and as though he would speak
contemptuously, yet dared not, â€œthis sort of thing has gone on at
intervals ever since. It spreads like wildfire, of course, mysterious
chatter of this kind, and people began trespassing all over the estate,
coming to see the wood, and making themselves a general nuisance.
Notices of man-traps and spring-guns only seemed to increase their
persistence; and--think of it,â€ he snorted, â€œsome local Research
Society actually wrote and asked permission for one of their members
to spend a night in the wood! Bolder fools, who didnâ€™t write for
leave, came and took away bits of bark from the trees and gave them
to clairvoyants, who invented in their turn a further batch of tales.
There was simply no end to it all.â€

â€œMost distressing and annoying, I can well believe,â€ interposed the
doctor.

â€œThen suddenly the phenomena ceased as mysteriously as they had begun,
and the interest flagged. The tales stopped. People got interested in
something else. It all seemed to die out. This was last July. I can
tell you exactly, for Iâ€™ve kept a diary more or less of what happened.â€

â€œAh!â€

â€œBut now, quite recently, within the past three weeks, it has all
revived again with a rush--with a kind of furious attack, so to speak.
It has really become unbearable. You may imagine what it means, and the
general state of affairs, when I say that the possibility of leaving
has occurred to me.â€

â€œIncendiarism?â€ suggested Dr. Silence, half under his breath, but not
so low that Colonel Wragge did not hear him.

â€œBy Jove, sir, you take the very words out of my mouth!â€ exclaimed
the astonished man, glancing from the doctor to me and from me to the
doctor, and rattling the money in his pocket as though some explanation
of my friendâ€™s divining powers were to be found that way.

â€œItâ€™s only that you are thinking very vividly,â€ the doctor said
quietly, â€œand your thoughts form pictures in my mind before you utter
them. Itâ€™s merely a little elementary thought-reading.â€

His intention, I saw, was not to perplex the good man, but to impress
him with his powers so as to ensure obedience later.

â€œGood Lord! I had no idea----â€ He did not finish the sentence, and
dived again abruptly into his narrative.

â€œI did not see anything myself, I must admit, but the stories of
independent eye-witnesses were to the effect that lines of light, like
streams of thin fire, moved through the wood and sometimes were seen
to shoot out precisely as flames might shoot out--in the direction of
this house. There,â€ he explained, in a louder voice that made me jump,
pointing with a thick finger to the map, â€œwhere the westerly fringe of
the plantation comes up to the end of the lower lawn at the back of
the house--where it links on to those dark patches, which are laurel
shrubberies, running right up to the back premises--thatâ€™s where these
lights were seen. They passed from the wood to the shrubberies, and
in this way reached the house itself. Like silent rockets, one man
described them, rapid as lightning and exceedingly bright.â€

â€œAnd this evidence you spoke of?â€

â€œThey actually reached the sides of the house. Theyâ€™ve left a mark of
scorching on the walls--the walls of the laundry building at the other
end. You shall see â€™em tomorrow.â€ He pointed to the map to indicate the
spot, and then straightened himself and glared about the room as though
he had said something no one could believe and expected contradiction.

â€œScorched--just as the faces were,â€ the doctor murmured, looking
significantly at me.

â€œScorched--yes,â€ repeated the Colonel, failing to catch the rest of the
sentence in his excitement.

There was a prolonged silence in the room, in which I heard the
gurgling of the oil in the lamp and the click of the coals and the
heavy breathing of our host. The most unwelcome sensations were
creeping about my spine, and I wondered whether my companion would
scorn me utterly if I asked to sleep on the sofa in his room. It was
eleven oâ€™clock, I saw by the clock on the mantelpiece. We had crossed
the dividing line and were now well in the movement of the adventure.
The fight between my interest and my dread became acute. But, even if
turning back had been possible, I think the interest would have easily
gained the day.

â€œI have enemies, of course,â€ I heard the Colonelâ€™s rough voice break
into the pause presently, â€œand have discharged a number of servants----â€

â€œItâ€™s not that,â€ put in John Silence briefly.

â€œYou think not? In a sense I am glad, and yet--there are some things
that can be met and dealt with----â€

He left the sentence unfinished, and looked down at the floor with
an expression of grim severity that betrayed a momentary glimpse of
character. This fighting man loathed and abhorred the thought of an
enemy he could not see and come to grips with. Presently he moved over
and sat down in the chair between us. Something like a sigh escaped
him. Dr. Silence said nothing.

â€œMy sister, of course, is kept in ignorance, as far as possible, of all
this,â€ he said disconnectedly, and as if talking to himself. â€œBut even
if she knew, she would find matter-of-fact explanations. I only wish I
could. Iâ€™m sure they exist.â€

There came then an interval in the conversation that was very
significant. It did not seem a real pause, or the silence real silence,
for both men continued to think so rapidly and strongly that one almost
imagined their thoughts clothed themselves in words in the air of the
room. I was more than a little keyed up with the strange excitement
of all I had heard, but what stimulated my nerves more than anything
else was the obvious fact that the doctor was clearly upon the trail of
discovery. In his mind at that moment, I believe, he had already solved
the nature of this perplexing psychical problem. His face was like a
mask, and he employed the absolute minimum of gesture and words. All
his energies were directed inwards, and by those incalculable methods
and processes he had mastered with such infinite patience and study, I
felt sure he was already in touch with the forces behind these singular
phenomena and laying his deep plans for bringing them into the open,
and then effectively dealing with them.

Colonel Wragge meanwhile grew more and more fidgety. From time to time
he turned towards my companion, as though about to speak, yet always
changing his mind at the last moment. Once he went over and opened
the door suddenly, apparently to see if any one were listening at
the keyhole, for he disappeared a moment between the two doors, and I
then heard him open the outer one. He stood there for some seconds and
made a noise as though he were sniffing the air like a dog. Then he
closed both doors cautiously and came back to the fireplace. A strange
excitement seemed growing upon him. Evidently he was trying to make up
his mind to say something that he found it difficult to say. And John
Silence, as I rightly judged, was waiting patiently for him to choose
his own opportunity and his own way of saying it. At last he turned and
faced us, squaring his great shoulders, and stiffening perceptibly.

Dr. Silence looked up sympathetically.

â€œYour own experiences help me most,â€ he observed quietly.

â€œThe fact is,â€ the Colonel said, speaking very low, â€œthis past week
there have been outbreaks of fire in the house itself. Three separate
outbreaks--and all--in my sisterâ€™s room.â€

â€œYes,â€ the doctor said, as if this was just what he had expected to
hear.

â€œUtterly unaccountable--all of them,â€ added the other, and then sat
down. I began to understand something of the reason of his excitement.
He was realising at last that the â€œnaturalâ€ explanation he had held to
all along was becoming impossible, and he hated it. It made him angry.

â€œFortunately,â€ he went on, â€œshe was out each time and does not know.
But I have made her sleep now in a room on the ground floor.â€

â€œA wise precaution,â€ the doctor said simply. He asked one or two
questions. The fires had started in the curtains--once by the window
and once by the bed. The third time smoke had been discovered by the
maid coming from the cupboard, and it was found that Miss Wraggeâ€™s
clothes hanging on the hooks were smouldering. The doctor listened
attentively, but made no comment.

â€œAnd now can you tell me,â€ he said presently, â€œwhat your own feeling
about it is--your general impression?â€

â€œIt sounds foolish to say so,â€ replied the soldier, after a momentâ€™s
hesitation, â€œbut I feel exactly as I have often felt on active service
in my Indian campaigns: just as if the house and all in it were in a
state of siege; as though a concealed enemy were encamped about us--in
ambush somewhere.â€ He uttered a soft nervous laugh. â€œAs if the next
sign of smoke would precipitate a panic--a dreadful panic.â€

The picture came before me of the night shadowing the house, and the
twisted pine trees he had described crowding about it, concealing some
powerful enemy; and, glancing at the resolute face and figure of the
old soldier, forced at length to his confession, I understood something
of all he had been through before he sought the assistance of John
Silence.

â€œAnd tomorrow, unless I am mistaken, is full moon,â€ said the doctor
suddenly, watching the otherâ€™s face for the effect of his apparently
careless words.

Colonel Wragge gave an uncontrollable start, and his face for the first
time showed unmistakable pallor.

â€œWhat in the world----?â€ he began, his lip quivering.

â€œOnly that I am beginning to see light in this extraordinary affair,â€
returned the other calmly, â€œand, if my theory is correct, each month
when the moon is at the full should witness an increase in the activity
of the phenomena.â€

â€œI donâ€™t see the connection,â€ Colonel Wragge answered almost savagely,
â€œbut I am bound to say my diary bears you out.â€ He wore the most
puzzled expression I have ever seen upon an honest face, but he
abhorred this additional corroboration of an explanation that perplexed
him.

â€œI confess,â€ he repeated; â€œI cannot see the connection.â€

â€œWhy should you?â€ said the doctor, with his first laugh that evening.
He got up and hung the map upon the wall again. â€œBut I do--because
these things are my special study--and let me add that I have yet
to come across a problem that is not natural, and has not a natural
explanation. Itâ€™s merely a question of how much one knows--and admits.â€

Colonel Wragge eyed him with a new and curious respect in his face. But
his feelings were soothed. Moreover, the doctorâ€™s laugh and change of
manner came as a relief to all, and broke the spell of grave suspense
that had held us so long. We all rose and stretched our limbs, and took
little walks about the room.

â€œI am glad, Dr. Silence, if you will allow me to say so, that you are
here,â€ he said simply, â€œvery glad indeed. And now I fear I have kept
you both up very late,â€ with a glance to include me, â€œfor you must be
tired, and ready for your beds. I have told you all there is to tell,â€
he added, â€œand tomorrow you must feel perfectly free to take any steps
you think necessary.â€

The end was abrupt, yet natural, for there was nothing more to say, and
neither of these men talked for mere talkingâ€™s sake.

Out in the cold and chilly hall he lit our candles and took us
upstairs. The house was at rest and still, every one asleep. We moved
softly. Through the windows on the stairs we saw the moonlight falling
across the lawn, throwing deep shadows. The nearer pine trees were just
visible in the distance, a wall of impenetrable blackness.

Our host came for a moment to our rooms to see that we had everything.
He pointed to a coil of strong rope lying beside the window, fastened
to the wall by means of an iron ring. Evidently it had been recently
put in.

â€œI donâ€™t think we shall need it,â€ Dr. Silence said, with a smile.

â€œI trust not,â€ replied our host gravely. â€œI sleep quite close to you
across the landing,â€ he whispered, pointing to his door, â€œand if
you--if you want anything in the night you will know where to find me.â€

He wished us pleasant dreams and disappeared down the passage into his
room, shading the candle with his big muscular hand from the draughts.

John Silence stopped me a moment before I went.

â€œYou know what it is?â€ I asked, with an excitement that even overcame
my weariness.

â€œYes,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™m almost sure. And you?â€

â€œNot the smallest notion.â€

He looked disappointed, but not half as disappointed as I felt.

â€œEgypt,â€ he whispered, â€œEgypt!â€


II

Nothing happened to disturb me in the night--nothing, that is, except a
nightmare in which Colonel Wragge chased me amid thin streaks of fire,
and his sister always prevented my escape by suddenly rising up out of
the ground in her chair--dead. The deep baying of dogs woke me once,
just before the dawn, it must have been, for I saw the window frame
against the sky; there was a flash of lightning, too, I thought, as I
turned over in bed. And it was warm, for October oppressively warm.

It was after eleven oâ€™clock when our host suggested going out with
the guns, these, we understood, being a somewhat thin disguise for
our true purpose. Personally, I was glad to be in the open air, for
the atmosphere of the house was heavy with presentiment. The sense
of impending disaster hung over all. Fear stalked the passages, and
lurked in the corners of every room. It was a house haunted, but really
haunted; not by some vague shadow of the dead, but by a definite
though incalculable influence that was actively alive, and dangerous.
At the least smell of smoke the entire household quivered. An odour
of burning, I was convinced, would paralyse all the inmates. For the
servants, though professedly ignorant by the masterâ€™s unspoken orders,
yet shared the common dread; and the hideous uncertainty, joined with
this display of so spiteful and calculated a spirit of malignity,
provided a kind of black doom that draped not only the walls, but also
the minds of the people living within them.

Only the bright and cheerful vision of old Miss Wragge being pushed
about the house in her noiseless chair, chatting and nodding briskly
to every one she met, prevented us from giving way entirely to the
depression which governed the majority. The sight of her was like a
gleam of sunshine through the depths of some ill-omened wood, and just
as we went out I saw her being wheeled along by her attendant into the
sunshine of the back lawn, and caught her cheery smile as she turned
her head and wished us good sport.

The morning was October at its best. Sunshine glistened on the
dew-drenched grass and on leaves turned golden-red. The dainty
messengers of coming hoar-frost were already in the air, asearch for
permanent winter quarters. From the wide moors that everywhere swept up
against the sky, like a purple sea splashed by the occasional grey of
rocky clefts, there stole down the cool and perfumed wind of the west.
And the keen taste of the sea ran through all like a master-flavour,
borne over the spaces perhaps by the seagulls that cried and circled
high in the air.

But our host took little interest in this sparkling beauty, and had
no thought of showing off the scenery of his property. His mind was
otherwise intent, and, for that matter, so were our own.

â€œThose bleak moors and hills stretch unbroken for hours,â€ he said, with
a sweep of the hand; â€œand over there, some four miles,â€ pointing in
another direction, â€œlies S---- Bay, a long, swampy inlet of the sea,
haunted by myriads of seabirds. On the other side of the house are the
plantations and pine-woods. I thought we would get the dogs and go
first to the Twelve Acre Wood I told you about last night. Itâ€™s quite
near.â€

We found the dogs in the stable, and I recalled the deep baying of the
night when a fine bloodhound and two great Danes leaped out to greet
us. Singular companions for guns, I thought to myself, as we struck out
across the fields and the great creatures bounded and ran beside us,
nose to ground.

The conversation was scanty. John Silenceâ€™s grave face did not
encourage talk. He wore the expression I knew well--that look of
earnest solicitude which meant that his whole being was deeply absorbed
and preoccupied. Frightened, I had never seen him, but anxious
often--it always moved me to witness it--and he was anxious now.

â€œOn the way back you shall see the laundry building,â€ Colonel Wragge
observed shortly, for he, too, found little to say. â€œWe shall attract
less attention then.â€

Yet not all the crisp beauty of the morning seemed able to dispel the
feelings of uneasy dread that gathered increasingly about our minds as
we went.

In a very few minutes a clump of pine trees concealed the house from
view, and we found ourselves on the outskirts of a densely-grown
plantation of conifers. Colonel Wragge stopped abruptly, and, producing
a map from his pocket, explained once more very briefly its position
with regard to the house. He showed how it ran up almost to the walls
of the laundry building--though at the moment beyond our actual
view--and pointed to the windows of his sisterâ€™s bedroom where the
fires had been. The room, now empty, looked straight on to the wood.
Then, glancing nervously about him, and calling the dogs to heel,
he proposed that we should enter the plantation and make as thorough
examination of it as we thought worth while. The dogs, he added, might
perhaps be persuaded to accompany us a little way--and he pointed to
where they cowered at his feet--but he doubted it. â€œNeither voice
nor whip will get them very far, Iâ€™m afraid,â€ he said. â€œI know by
experience.â€

â€œIf you have no objection,â€ replied Dr. Silence, with decision, and
speaking almost for the first time, â€œwe will make our examination
alone--Mr. Hubbard and myself. It will be best so.â€

His tone was absolutely final, and the Colonel acquiesced so politely
that even a less intuitive man than myself must have seen that he was
genuinely relieved.

â€œYou doubtless have good reasons,â€ he said.

â€œMerely that I wish to obtain my impressions uncoloured. This delicate
clue I am working on might be so easily blurred by the thought-currents
of another mind with strongly preconceived ideas.â€

â€œPerfectly. I understand,â€ rejoined the soldier, though with an
expression of countenance that plainly contradicted his words. â€œThen I
will wait here with the dogs; and weâ€™ll have a look at the laundry on
our way home.â€

I turned once to look back as we clambered over the low stone wall
built by the late owner, and saw his straight, soldierly figure
standing in the sunlit field watching us with a curiously intent look
on his face. There was something to me incongruous, yet distinctly
pathetic, in the manâ€™s efforts to meet all far-fetched explanations
of the mystery with contempt, and at the same time in his stolid,
unswerving investigation of it all. He nodded at me and made a gesture
of farewell with his hand. That picture of him, standing in the
sunshine with his big dogs, steadily watching us, remains with me to
this day.

Dr. Silence led the way in among the twisted trunks, planted closely
together in serried ranks, and I followed sharp at his heels. The
moment we were out of sight he turned and put down his gun against the
roots of a big tree, and I did likewise.

â€œWe shall hardly want these cumbersome weapons of murder,â€ he observed,
with a passing smile.

â€œYou are sure of your clue, then?â€ I asked at once, bursting with
curiosity, yet fearing to betray it lest he should think me unworthy.
His own methods were so absolutely simple and untheatrical.

â€œI am sure of my clue,â€ he answered gravely. â€œAnd I think we have come
just in time. You shall know in due course. For the present--be content
to follow and observe. And think steadily. The support of your mind
will help me.â€

His voice had that quiet mastery in it which leads men to face death
with a sort of happiness and pride. I would have followed him anywhere
at that moment. At the same time his words conveyed a sense of dread
seriousness. I caught the thrill of his confidence; but also, in this
broad light of day, I felt the measure of alarm that lay behind.

â€œYou still have no strong impressions?â€ he asked. â€œNothing happened in
the night, for instance? No vivid dreamings?â€

He looked closely for my answer, I was aware.

â€œI slept almost an unbroken sleep. I was tremendously tired, you know,
and, but for the oppressive heat----â€

â€œGood! You still notice the heat, then,â€ he said to himself, rather
than expecting an answer. â€œAnd the lightning?â€ he added, â€œthat
lightning out of a clear sky--that flashing--did you notice _that_?â€

I answered truly that I thought I had seen a flash during a moment of
wakefulness, and he then drew my attention to certain facts before
moving on.

â€œYou remember the sensation of warmth when you put the letter to your
forehead in the train; the heat generally in the house last evening,
and, as you now mention, in the night. You heard, too, the Colonelâ€™s
stories about the appearances of fire in this wood and in the house
itself, and the way his brother and the gamekeeper came to their deaths
twenty years ago.â€

I nodded, wondering what in the world it all meant.

â€œAnd you get no clue from these facts?â€ he asked, a trifle surprised.

I searched every corner of my mind and imagination for some inkling of
his meaning, but was obliged to admit that I understood nothing so far.

â€œNever mind; you will later. And now,â€ he added, â€œwe will go over the
wood and see what we can find.â€

His words explained to me something of his method. We were to keep our
minds alert and report to each other the least fancy that crossed the
picture-gallery of our thoughts. Then, just as we started, he turned
again to me with a final warning.

â€œAnd, for your safety,â€ he said earnestly, â€œimagine _now_--and for that
matter, imagine always until we leave this place--imagine with the
utmost keenness, that you are surrounded by a shell that protects you.
Picture yourself inside a protective envelope, and build it up with the
most intense imagination you can evoke. Pour the whole force of your
thought and will into it. Believe vividly all through this adventure
that such a shell, constructed of your thought, will and imagination,
surrounds you completely, and that nothing can pierce it to attack.â€

He spoke with dramatic conviction, gazing hard at me as though to
enforce his meaning, and then moved forward and began to pick his way
over the rough, tussocky ground into the wood. And meanwhile, knowing
the efficacy of his prescription, I adopted it to the best of my
ability.

The trees at once closed about us like the night. Their branches met
overhead in a continuous tangle, their stems crept closer and closer,
the brambly undergrowth thickened and multiplied. We tore our trousers,
scratched our hands, and our eyes filled with fine dust that made it
most difficult to avoid the clinging, prickly network of branches and
creepers. Coarse white grass that caught our feet like string grew here
and there in patches. It crowned the lumps of peaty growth that stuck
up like human heads, fantastically dressed, thrusting up at us out of
the ground with crests of dead hair. We stumbled and floundered among
them. It was hard going, and I could well conceive it impossible to
find a way at all in the night-time. We jumped, when possible, from
tussock to tussock, and it seemed as though we were springing among
heads on a battlefield, and that this dead white grass concealed eyes
that turned to stare as we passed.

Here and there the sunlight shot in with vivid spots of white light,
dazzling the sight, but only making the surrounding gloom deeper by
contrast And on two occasions we passed dark circular places in the
grass where fires had eaten their mark and left a ring of ashes. Dr.
Silence pointed to them, but without comment and without pausing, and
the sight of them woke in me a singular realisation of the dread that
lay so far only just out of sight in this adventure.

It was exhausting work, and heavy going. We kept close together. The
warmth, too, was extraordinary. Yet it did not seem the warmth of the
body due to violent exertion, but rather an inner heat of the mind that
laid glowing hands of fire upon the heart and set the brain in a kind
of steady blaze. When my companion found himself too far in advance,
he waited for me to come up. The place had evidently been untouched by
hand of man, keeper, forester or sportsman, for many a year; and my
thoughts, as we advanced painfully, were not unlike the state of the
wood itself--dark, confused, full of a haunting wonder and the shadow
of fear.

By this time all signs of the open field behind us were hid. No
single gleam penetrated. We might have been groping in the heart of
some primeval forest. Then, suddenly, the brambles and tussocks and
string-like grass came to an end; the trees opened out; and the ground
began to slope upwards towards a large central mound. We had reached
the middle of the plantation, and before us stood the broken Druid
stones our host had mentioned. We walked easily up the little hill,
between the sparser stems, and, resting upon one of the ivy-covered
boulders, looked round upon a comparatively open space, as large,
perhaps, as a small London Square.

Thinking of the ceremonies and sacrifices this rough circle of
prehistoric monoliths might have witnessed, I looked up into my
companionâ€™s face with an unspoken question. But he read my thought and
shook his head.

â€œOur mystery has nothing to do with these dead symbols,â€ he said,
â€œbut with something perhaps even more ancient, and of another country
altogether.â€

â€œEgypt?â€ I said half under my breath, hopelessly puzzled, but recalling
his words in my bedroom.

He nodded. Mentally I still floundered, but he seemed intensely
preoccupied and it was no time for asking questions; so while his words
circled unintelligibly in my mind I looked round at the scene before
me, glad of the opportunity to recover breath and some measure of
composure. But hardly had I time to notice the twisted and contorted
shapes of many of the pine trees close at hand when Dr. Silence leaned
over and touched me on the shoulder. He pointed down the slope. And the
look I saw in his eyes keyed up every nerve in my body to its utmost
pitch.

A thin, almost imperceptible column of blue smoke was rising among the
trees some twenty yards away at the foot of the mound. It curled up and
up, and disappeared from sight among the tangled branches overhead. It
was scarcely thicker than the smoke from a small brand of burning wood.

â€œProtect yourself! Imagine your shell strongly,â€ whispered the doctor
sharply, â€œand follow me closely.â€

He rose at once and moved swiftly down the slope towards the smoke,
and I followed, afraid to remain alone. I heard the soft crunching of
our steps on the pine needles. Over his shoulder I watched the thin
blue spiral, without once taking my eyes off it. I hardly know how
to describe the peculiar sense of vague horror inspired in me by the
sight of that streak of smoke pencilling its way upwards among the
dark trees. And the sensation of increasing heat as we approached was
phenomenal. It was like walking towards a glowing yet invisible fire.

As we drew nearer his pace slackened. Then he stopped and pointed, and
I saw a small circle of burnt grass upon the ground. The tussocks were
blackened and smouldering, and from the centre rose this line of smoke,
pale, blue, steady. Then I noticed a movement of the atmosphere beside
us, as if the warm air were rising and the cooler air rushing in to
take its place: a little centre of wind in the stillness. Overhead the
boughs stirred and trembled where the smoke disappeared. Otherwise, not
a tree sighed, not a sound made itself heard. The wood was still as a
graveyard. A horrible idea came to me that the course of nature was
about to change without warning, _had_ changed a little already, that
the sky would drop, or the surface of the earth crash inwards like a
broken bubble. Something, certainly, reached up to the citadel of my
reason, causing its throne to shake.

John Silence moved forward again. I could not see his face, but his
attitude was plainly one of resolution, of muscles and mind ready for
vigorous action. We were within ten feet of the blackened circle when
the smoke of a sudden ceased to rise, and vanished. The tail of the
column disappeared in the air above, and at the same instant it seemed
to me that the sensation of heat passed from my face, and the motion
of the wind was gone. The calm spirit of the fresh October day resumed
command.

Side by side we advanced and examined the place. The grass was
smouldering, the ground still hot. The circle of burned earth was a
foot to a foot and a half in diameter. It looked like an ordinary
picnic fire-place. I bent down cautiously to look, but in a second
I sprang back with an involuntary cry of alarm, for, as the doctor
stamped on the ashes to prevent them spreading, a sound of hissing rose
from the spot as though he had kicked a living creature. This hissing
was faintly audible in the air. It moved past us, away towards the
thicker portion of the wood in the direction of our field, and in a
second Dr. Silence had left the fire and started in pursuit.

And then began the most extraordinary hunt of invisibility I can ever
conceive.

He went fast even at the beginning, and, of course, it was perfectly
obvious that he was following something. To judge by the poise of his
head he kept his eyes steadily at a certain level--just above the
height of a man--and the consequence was he stumbled a good deal over
the roughness of the ground. The hissing sound had stopped. There was
no sound of any kind, and what he saw to follow was utterly beyond me.
I only know, that in mortal dread of being left behind, and with a
biting curiosity to see whatever there was to be seen, I followed as
quickly as I could, and even then barely succeeded in keeping up with
him.

And, as we went, the whole mad jumble of the Colonelâ€™s stories ran
through my brain, touching a sense of frightened laughter that was only
held in check by the sight of this earnest, hurrying figure before me.
For John Silence at work inspired me with a kind of awe. He looked
so diminutive among these giant twisted trees, while yet I knew that
his purpose and his knowledge were so great, and even in hurry he was
dignified. The fancy that we were playing some queer, exaggerated game
together met the fact that we were two men dancing upon the brink of
some possible tragedy, and the mingling of the two emotions in my mind
was both grotesque and terrifying.

He never turned in his mad chase, but pushed rapidly on, while I panted
after him like a figure in some unreasoning nightmare. And, as I ran,
it came upon me that he had been aware all the time, in his quiet,
internal way, of many things that he had kept for his own secret
consideration; he had been watching, waiting, planning from the very
moment we entered the shade of the wood. By some inner, concentrated
process of mind, dynamic if not actually magical, he had been in direct
contact with the source of the whole adventure, the very essence of the
real mystery. And now the forces were moving to a climax. Something
was about to happen, something important, something possibly dreadful.
Every nerve, every sense, every significant gesture of the plunging
figure before me proclaimed the fact just as surely as the skies, the
winds, and the face of the earth tell the birds the time to migrate and
warn the animals that danger lurks and they must move.

In a few moments we reached the foot of the mound and entered the
tangled undergrowth that lay between us and the sunlight of the field.
Here the difficulties of fast travelling increased a hundredfold. There
were brambles to dodge, low boughs to dive under, and countless tree
trunks closing up to make a direct path impossible. Yet Dr. Silence
never seemed to falter or hesitate. He went, diving, jumping, dodging,
ducking, but ever in the same main direction, following a clean trail.
Twice I tripped and fell, and both times, when I picked myself up
again, I saw him ahead of me, still forcing a way like a dog after
its quarry. And sometimes, like a dog, he stopped and pointed--human
pointing it was, psychic pointing,--and each time he stopped to point I
heard that faint high hissing in the air beyond us. The instinct of an
infallible dowser possessed him, and he made no mistakes.

At length, abruptly, I caught up with him, and found that we stood
at the edge of the shallow pond Colonel Wragge had mentioned in his
account the night before. It was long and narrow, filled with dark
brown water, in which the trees were dimly reflected. Not a ripple
stirred its surface.

â€œWatch!â€ he cried out, as I came up. â€œItâ€™s going to cross. Itâ€™s bound
to betray itself. The water is its natural enemy, and we shall see the
direction.â€

And, even as he spoke, a thin line like the track of a water-spider,
shot swiftly across the shiny surface; there was a ghost of steam in
the air above; and immediately I became aware of an odour of burning.

Dr. Silence turned and shot a glance at me that made me think of
lightning. I began to shake all over.

â€œQuick!â€ he cried with excitement, â€œto the trail again! We must run
round. Itâ€™s going to the house!â€

The alarm in his voice quite terrified me. Without a false step I
dashed round the slippery banks and dived again at his heels into the
sea of bushes and tree trunks. We were now in the thick of the very
dense belt that ran round the outer edge of the plantation, and the
field was near; yet so dark was the tangle that it was some time before
the first shafts of white sunlight became visible. The doctor now ran
in zigzags. He was following something that dodged and doubled quite
wonderfully, yet had begun, I fancied, to move more slowly than before.

â€œQuick!â€ he cried. â€œIn the light we shall lose it!â€

I still saw nothing, heard nothing, caught no suggestion of a trail;
yet this man, guided by some interior divining that seemed infallible,
made no false turns, though how we failed to crash headlong into the
trees has remained a mystery to me ever since. And then, with a sudden
rush, we found ourselves on the skirts of the wood with the open field
lying in bright sunshine before our eyes.

â€œToo late!â€ I heard him cry, a note of anguish in his voice. â€œItâ€™s
out--and, by God, itâ€™s making for the house!â€

I saw the Colonel standing in the field with his dogs where we had left
him. He was bending double, peering into the wood where he heard us
running, and he straightened up like a bent whip released. John Silence
dashed passed, calling him to follow.

â€œWe shall lose the trail in the light,â€ I heard him cry as he ran. â€œBut
quick! We may yet get there in time!â€

That wild rush across the open field, with the dogs at our heels,
leaping and barking, and the elderly Colonel behind us running as
though for his life, shall I ever forget it? Though I had only vague
ideas of the meaning of it all, I put my best foot forward, and, being
the youngest of the three, I reached the house an easy first. I drew
up, panting, and turned to wait for the others. But, as I turned,
something moving a little distance away caught my eye, and in that
moment I swear I experienced the most overwhelming and singular shock
of surprise and terror I have ever known, or can conceive as possible.

For the front door was open, and the waist of the house being narrow, I
could see through the hall into the dining-room beyond, and so out on
to the back lawn, and there I saw no less a sight than the figure of
Miss Wragge--running. Even at that distance it was plain that she had
seen me, and was coming fast towards me, running with the frantic gait
of a terror-stricken woman. She had recovered the use of her legs.

Her face was a livid grey, as of death itself, but the general
expression was one of laughter, for her mouth was gaping, and her eyes,
always bright shone with the light of a wild merriment that seemed the
merriment of a child, yet was singularly ghastly. And that very second,
as she fled past me into her brotherâ€™s arms behind, I smelt again most
unmistakably the odour of burning, and to this day the smell of smoke
and fire can come very near to turning me sick with the memory of what
I had seen.

Fast on her heels, too, came the terrified attendant, more mistress of
herself, and able to speak--which the old lady could not do--but with a
face almost, if not quite, as fearful.

â€œWe were down by the bushes in the sun,â€--she gasped and screamed in
reply to Colonel Wraggeâ€™s distracted questionings,--â€œI was wheeling the
chair as usual when she shrieked and leaped--I donâ€™t know exactly--I
was too frightened to see--Oh, my God! she jumped clean out of the
chair--_and ran!_ There was a blast of hot air from the wood, and she
hid her face and jumped. She didnâ€™t make a sound--she didnâ€™t cry out,
or make a sound. She just ran.â€

But the nightmare horror of it all reached the breaking point a few
minutes later, and while I was still standing in the hall temporarily
bereft of speech and movement; for while the doctor, the Colonel and
the attendant were half-way up the staircase, helping the fainting
woman to the privacy of her room, and all in a confused group of dark
figures, there sounded a voice behind me, and I turned to see the
butler, his face dripping with perspiration, his eyes starting out of
his head.

â€œThe laundryâ€™s on fire!â€ he cried; â€œthe laundry buildingâ€™s a-caught!â€

I remember his odd expression â€œa-caught,â€ and wanting to laugh, but
finding my face rigid and inflexible.

â€œThe devilâ€™s about again, sâ€™help me Gawd!â€ he cried, in a voice thin
with terror, running about in circles.

And then the group on the stairs scattered as at the sound of a shot,
and the Colonel and Dr. Silence came down three steps at a time,
leaving the afflicted Miss Wragge to the care of her single attendant.

We were out across the front lawn in a moment and round the corner
of the house, the Colonel leading, Silence and I at his heels, and
the portly butler puffing some distance in the rear, getting more and
more mixed in his addresses to God and the devil; and the moment we
passed the stables and came into view of the laundry building, we saw a
wicked-looking volume of smoke pouring out of the narrow windows, and
the frightened women-servants and grooms running hither and thither,
calling aloud as they ran.

The arrival of the master restored order instantly, and this retired
soldier, poor thinker perhaps, but capable man of action, had the
matter in hand from the start. He issued orders like a martinet, and,
almost before I could realise it, there were streaming buckets on the
scene and a line of men and women formed between the building and the
stable pump.

â€œInside,â€ I heard John Silence cry, and the Colonel followed him
through the door, while I was just quick enough at their heels to hear
him add, â€œthe smokeâ€™s the worst part of it. Thereâ€™s no fire yet, I
think.â€

And, true enough, there was no fire. The interior was thick with smoke,
but it speedily cleared and not a single bucket was used upon the floor
or walls. The air was stifling, the heat fearful.

â€œThereâ€™s precious little to burn in here; itâ€™s all stone,â€ the Colonel
exclaimed, coughing. But the doctor was pointing to the wooden covers
of the great cauldron in which the clothes were washed, and we saw that
these were smouldering and charred. And when we sprinkled half a bucket
of water on them the surrounding bricks hissed and fizzed and sent up
clouds of steam. Through the open door and windows this passed out with
the rest of the smoke, and we three stood there on the brick floor
staring at the spot and wondering, each in our own fashion, how in the
name of natural law the place could have caught fire or smoked at all.
And each was silent--myself from sheer incapacity and befuddlement, the
Colonel from the quiet pluck that faces all things yet speaks little,
and John Silence from the intense mental grappling with this latest
manifestation of a profound problem that called for concentration of
thought rather than for any words.

There was really nothing to say. The facts were indisputable.

Colonel Wragge was the first to utter.

â€œMy sister,â€ he said briefly, and moved off. In the yard I heard him
sending the frightened servants about their business in an excellently
matter-of-fact voice, scolding some one roundly for making such a big
fire and letting the flues get over-heated, and paying no heed to the
stammering reply that no fire had been lit there for several days. Then
he dispatched a groom on horseback for the local doctor.

Then Dr. Silence turned and looked at me. The absolute control he
possessed, not only over the outward expression of emotion by gesture,
change of colour, light in the eyes, and so forth, but also, as I well
knew, over its very birth in his heart, the mask-like face of the dead
he could assume at will, made it extremely difficult to know at any
given moment what was at work in his inner consciousness. But now, when
he turned and looked at me, there was no sphinx-expression there, but
rather the keen, triumphant face of a man who had solved a dangerous
and complicated problem, and saw his way to a clean victory.

â€œ_Now_ do you guess?â€ he asked quietly, as though it were the simplest
matter in the world, and ignorance were impossible.

I could only stare stupidly and remain silent. He glanced down at the
charred cauldron-lids, and traced a figure in the air with his finger.
But I was too excited, or too mortified, or still too dazed, perhaps,
to see what it was he outlined, or what it was he meant to convey. I
could only go on staring and shaking my puzzled head.

â€œA fire-elemental,â€ he cried, â€œa fire-elemental of the most powerful
and malignant kind----â€

â€œA what?â€ thundered the voice of Colonel Wragge behind us, having
returned suddenly and overheard.

â€œItâ€™s a fire-elemental,â€ repeated Dr. Silence more calmly, but
with a note of triumph in his voice he could not keep out, â€œand a
fire-elemental enraged.â€

The light began to dawn in my mind at last. But the Colonel--who had
never heard the term before, and was besides feeling considerably
worked-up for a plain man with all this mystery he knew not how to
grapple with--the Colonel stood, with the most dumfoundered look ever
seen on a human countenance, and continued to roar, and stammer, and
stare.

â€œAnd why,â€ he began, savage with the desire to find something visible
he could fight--â€œwhy, in the name of all the blazes----?â€ and then
stopped as John Silence moved up and took his arm.

â€œThere, my dear Colonel Wragge,â€ he said gently, â€œyou touch the heart
of the whole thing. You ask â€˜Why.â€™ That is precisely our problem.â€ He
held the soldierâ€™s eyes firmly with his own. â€œAnd that, too, I think,
we shall soon know. Come and let us talk over a plan of action--that
room with the double doors, perhaps.â€

The word â€œactionâ€ calmed him a little, and he led the way, without
further speech, back into the house, and down the long stone passage to
the room where we had heard his stories on the night of our arrival.
I understood from the doctorâ€™s glance that my presence would not make
the interview easier for our host, and I went upstairs to my own
room--shaking.

But in the solitude of my room the vivid memories of the last hour
revived so mercilessly that I began to feel I should never in my whole
life lose the dreadful picture of Miss Wragge running--that dreadful
human climax after all the non-human mystery in the wood--and I was not
sorry when a servant knocked at my door and said that Colonel Wragge
would be glad if I would join them in the little smoking-room.

â€œI think it is better you should be present,â€ was all Colonel Wragge
said as I entered the room. I took the chair with my back to the
window. There was still an hour before lunch, though I imagine that
the usual divisions of the day hardly found a place in the thoughts of
any one of us.

The atmosphere of the room was what I might call electric. The Colonel
was positively bristling; he stood with his back to the fire, fingering
an unlit black cigar, his face flushed, his being obviously roused
and ready for action. He hated this mystery. It was poisonous to his
nature, and he longed to meet something face to face--something he
could gauge and fight. Dr. Silence, I noticed at once, was sitting
before the map of the estate which was spread upon a table. I knew
by his expression the state of his mind. He was in the thick of it
all, knew it, delighted in it, and was working at high pressure. He
recognised my presence with a lifted eyelid, and the flash of the eye,
contrasted with his stillness and composure, told me volumes.

â€œI was about to explain to our host briefly what seems to me afoot in
all this business,â€ he said without looking up, â€œwhen he asked that you
should join us so that we can all work together.â€ And, while signifying
my assent, I caught myself wondering what quality it was in the calm
speech of this undemonstrative man that was so full of power, so
charged with the strange, virile personality behind it, and that seemed
to inspire us with his own confidence as by a process of radiation.

â€œMr. Hubbard,â€ he went on gravely, turning to the soldier, â€œknows
something of my methods, and in more than one--er--interesting
situation has proved of assistance. What we want nowâ€--and here he
suddenly got up and took his place on the mat beside the Colonel, and
looked hard at him--â€œis men who have self-control, who are sure of
themselves, whose minds at the critical moment will emit positive
forces, instead of the wavering and uncertain currents due to negative
feelings--due, for instance, to fear.â€

He looked at us each in turn. Colonel Wragge moved his feet farther
apart, and squared his shoulders; and I felt guilty but said nothing,
conscious that my latent store of courage was being deliberately hauled
to the front. He was winding me up like a clock.

â€œSo that, in what is yet to come,â€ continued our leader, â€œeach of us
will contribute his share of power, and ensure success for my plan.â€

â€œIâ€™m not afraid of anything I can _see_,â€ said the Colonel bluntly.

â€œIâ€™m ready,â€ I heard myself say, as it were automatically, â€œfor
anything,â€ and then added, feeling the declaration was lamely
insufficient, â€œand everything.â€

Dr. Silence left the mat and began walking to and fro about the room,
both hands plunged deep into the pockets of his shooting-jacket.
Tremendous vitality streamed from him. I never took my eyes off the
small, moving figure; small, yes,--and yet somehow making me think of
a giant plotting the destruction of worlds. And his manner was gentle,
as always, soothing almost, and his words uttered quietly without
emphasis or emotion. Most of what he said was addressed, though not too
obviously, to the Colonel.

â€œThe violence of this sudden attack,â€ he said softly, pacing to and
fro beneath the bookcase at the end of the room, â€œis due, of course,
partly to the fact that to-night the moon is at the fullâ€--here he
glanced at me for a moment--â€œand partly to the fact that we have all
been so deliberately concentrating upon the matter. Our thinking, our
investigation, has stirred it into unusual activity. I mean that the
intelligent force behind these manifestations has realised that some
one is busied about its destruction. And it is now on the defensive:
more, it is aggressive.â€

â€œBut â€˜itâ€™--what is â€˜itâ€™?â€ began the soldier, fuming. â€œWhat, in the name
of all thatâ€™s dreadful, _is_ a fire-elemental?â€

â€œI cannot give you at this moment,â€ replied Dr. Silence, turning to
him, but undisturbed by the interruption, â€œa lecture on the nature and
history of magic, but can only say that an Elemental is the active
force behind the elements,--whether earth, air, water, _or fire_,--it
is impersonal in its essential nature, but can be focused, personified,
ensouled, so to say, by those who know how--by magicians, if you
will--for certain purposes of their own, much in the same way that
steam and electricity can be harnessed by the practical man of this
century.

â€œAlone, these blind elemental energies can accomplish little, but
governed and directed by the trained will of a powerful manipulator
they may become potent activities for good or evil. They are the basis
of all magic, and it is the motive behind them that constitutes the
magic â€˜blackâ€™ or â€˜whiteâ€™; they can be the vehicles of curses or of
blessings, for a curse is nothing more than the thought of a violent
will perpetuated. And in such cases--cases like this--the conscious,
directing will of the mind that is using the elemental stands always
behind the phenomena----â€

â€œYou think that my brother----!â€ broke in the Colonel, aghast.

â€œHas nothing whatever to do with it--directly. The fire-elemental that
has here been tormenting you and your household was sent upon its
mission long before you, or your family, or your ancestors, or even the
nation you belong to--unless I am much mistaken--was even in existence.
We will come to that a little later; after the experiment I propose to
make we shall be more positive. At present I can only say we have to
deal now, not only with the phenomenon of Attacking Fire merely, but
with the vindictive and enraged intelligence that is directing it from
behind the scenes--vindictive and enraged,â€--he repeated the words.

â€œThat explains----â€ began Colonel Wragge, seeking furiously for words
he could not find quickly enough.

â€œMuch,â€ said John Silence, with a gesture to restrain him.

He stopped a moment in the middle of his walk, and a deep silence
came down over the little room. Through the windows the sunlight
seemed less bright, the long line of dark hills less friendly, making
me think of a vast wave towering to heaven and about to break and
overwhelm us. Something formidable had crept into the world about us.
For, undoubtedly, there was a disquieting thought, holding terror as
well as awe, in the picture his words conjured up: the conception of a
human will reaching its deathless hand, spiteful and destructive, down
through the ages, to strike the living and afflict the innocent.

â€œBut what _is_ its object?â€ burst out the soldier, unable to restrain
himself longer in the silence. â€œWhy does it come from that plantation?
And why should it attack us, or any one in particular?â€ Questions
began to pour from him in a stream.

â€œAll in good time,â€ the doctor answered quietly, having let him run
on for several minutes. â€œBut I must first discover positively what,
or who, it is that directs this particular fire-elemental. And, to
do that, we must firstâ€--he spoke with slow deliberation--â€œseek to
capture--to confine by visibility--to limit its sphere in a concrete
form.â€

â€œGood heavens almighty!â€ exclaimed the soldier, mixing his words in his
unfeigned surprise.

â€œQuite so,â€ pursued the other calmly; â€œfor in so doing I think we
can release it from the purpose that binds it, restore it to its
normal condition of latent fire, and alsoâ€--he lowered his voice
perceptibly--â€œalso discover the face and form of the Being that ensouls
it.â€

â€œThe man behind the gun!â€ cried the Colonel, beginning to understand
something, and leaning forward so as not to miss a single syllable.

â€œI mean that in the last resort, before it returns to the womb of
potential fire, it will probably assume the face and figure of its
Director, of the man of magical knowledge who originally bound it with
his incantations and sent it forth upon its mission of centuries.â€

The soldier sat down and gasped openly in his face, breathing hard; but
it was a very subdued voice that framed the question.

â€œAnd how do you propose to make it visible? How capture and confine it?
What dâ€™ye mean, Dr. John Silence?â€

â€œBy furnishing it with the materials for a form. By the process of
materialisation simply. Once limited by dimensions, it will become
slow, heavy, visible. We can then dissipate it. Invisible fire, you
see, is dangerous and incalculable; locked up in a form we can perhaps
manage it. We must betray it--to its death.â€

â€œAnd this material?â€ we asked in the same breath, although I think I
had already guessed.

â€œNot pleasant, but effective,â€ came the quiet reply; â€œthe exhalations
of freshly-spilled blood.â€

â€œNot human blood!â€ cried Colonel Wragge, starting up from his chair
with a voice like an explosion. I thought his eyes would start from
their sockets.

The face of Dr. Silence relaxed in spite of himself, and his
spontaneous little laugh brought a welcome though momentary relief.

â€œThe days of human sacrifice, I hope, will never come again,â€ he
explained. â€œAnimal blood will answer the purpose, and we can make the
experiment as pleasant as possible. Only, the blood must be freshly
spilled and strong with the vital emanations that attract this peculiar
class of elemental creature. Perhaps--perhaps if some pig on the estate
is ready for the market----â€

He turned to hide a smile; but the passing touch of comedy found
no echo in the mind of our host, who did not understand how to
change quickly from one emotion to another. Clearly he was debating
many things laboriously in his honest brain. But, in the end, the
earnestness and scientific disinterestedness of the doctor, whose
influence over him was already very great, won the day, and he
presently looked up more calmly, and observed shortly that he thought
perhaps the matter could be arranged.

â€œThere are other and pleasanter methods,â€ Dr. Silence went on to
explain, â€œbut they require time and preparation, and things have gone
much too far, in my opinion, to admit of delay. And the process need
cause you no distress: we sit round the bowl and await results. Nothing
more. The emanations of blood--which, as Levi says, is the first
incarnation of the universal fluid--furnish the materials out of which
the creatures of discarnate life, spirits if you prefer, can fashion
themselves a temporary appearance. The process is old, and lies at
the root of all blood sacrifice. It was known to the priests of Baal,
and it is known to the modern ecstasy dancers who cut themselves to
produce objective phantoms who dance with them. And the least gifted
clairvoyant could tell you that the forms to be seen in the vicinity of
slaughterhouses, or hovering above the deserted battlefield, are--well,
simply beyond all description. I do not mean,â€ he added, noticing the
uneasy fidgeting of his host, â€œthat anything in our laundry-experiment
need appear to terrify us, for this case seems a comparatively simple
one, and it is only the vindictive character of the intelligence
directing this fire-elemental that causes anxiety and makes for
personal danger.â€

â€œIt is curious,â€ said the Colonel, with a sudden rush of words,
drawing a deep breath, and as though speaking of things distasteful
to him, â€œthat during my years among the Hill Tribes of Northern India
I came across--personally came across--instances of the sacrifices of
blood to certain deities being stopped suddenly, and all manner of
disasters happening until they were resumed. Fires broke out in the
huts, and even on the clothes, of the natives--and--and I admit I
have read, in the course of my studies,â€--he made a gesture towards
his books and heavily laden table,--â€œof the Yezidis of Syria evoking
phantoms by means of cutting their bodies with knives during their
whirling dances--enormous globes of fire which turned into monstrous
and terrible forms--and I remember an account somewhere, too, how the
emaciated forms and pallid countenances of the spectres, that appeared
to the Emperor Julian, claimed to be the true Immortals, and told him
to renew the sacrifices of blood â€˜for the fumes of which, since the
establishment of Christianity, they had been piningâ€™--that these were
in reality the phantoms evoked by the rites of blood.â€

Both Dr. Silence and myself listened in amazement, for this sudden
speech was so unexpected, and betrayed so much more knowledge than we
had either of us suspected in the old soldier.

â€œThen perhaps you have read, too,â€ said the doctor, â€œhow the Cosmic
Deities of savage races, elemental in their nature, have been kept
alive through many ages by these blood rites?â€

â€œNo,â€ he answered; â€œthat is new to me.â€

â€œIn any case,â€ Dr. Silence added, â€œI am glad you are not wholly
unfamiliar with the subject, for you will now bring more sympathy, and
therefore more help, to our experiment. For, of course, in this case,
we only want the blood to tempt the creature from its lair and enclose
it in a form----â€

â€œI quite understand. And I only hesitated just now,â€ he went on,
his words coming much more slowly, as though he felt he had already
said too much, â€œbecause I wished to be quite sure it was no mere
curiosity, but an actual sense of necessity that dictated this horrible
experiment.â€

â€œIt is your safety, and that of your household, and of your sister,
that is at stake,â€ replied the doctor. â€œOnce I have _seen_, I hope to
discover whence this elemental comes, and what its real purpose is.â€

Colonel Wragge signified his assent with a bow.

â€œAnd the moon will help us,â€ the other said, â€œfor it will be full in
the early hours of the morning, and this kind of elemental-being is
always most active at the period of full moon. Hence, you see, the clue
furnished by your diary.â€

So it was finally settled. Colonel Wragge would provide the materials
for the experiment, and we were to meet at midnight. How he would
contrive at that hour--but that was his business. I only know we
both realised that he would keep his word, and whether a pig died at
midnight, or at noon, was after all perhaps only a question of the
sleep and personal comfort of the executioner.

â€œTo-night, then, in the laundry,â€ said Dr. Silence finally, to clinch
the plan; â€œwe three alone--and at midnight, when the household is
asleep and we shall be free from disturbance.â€

He exchanged significant glances with our host, who, at that moment,
was called away by the announcement that the family doctor had arrived,
and was ready to see him in his sisterâ€™s room.

For the remainder of the afternoon John Silence disappeared. I had my
suspicions that he made a secret visit to the plantation and also to
the laundry building; but, in any case, we saw nothing of him, and
he kept strictly to himself. He was preparing for the night, I felt
sure, but the nature of his preparations I could only guess. There was
movement in his room, I heard, and an odour like incense hung about the
door, and knowing that he regarded rites as the vehicles of energies,
my guesses were probably not far wrong.

Colonel Wragge, too, remained absent the greater part of the afternoon,
and, deeply afflicted, had scarcely left his sisterâ€™s bedside, but in
response to my inquiry when we met for a moment at tea-time, he told me
that although she had moments of attempted speech, her talk was quite
incoherent and hysterical, and she was still quite unable to explain
the nature of what she had seen. The doctor, he said, feared she had
recovered the use of her limbs, only to lose that of her memory, and
perhaps even of her mind.

â€œThen the recovery of her legs, I trust, may be permanent, at any
rate,â€ I ventured, finding it difficult to know what sympathy to offer.
And he replied with a curious short laugh, â€œOh yes; about that there
can be no doubt whatever.â€

And it was due merely to the chance of my overhearing a fragment of
conversation--unwillingly, of course--that a little further light was
thrown upon the state in which the old lady actually lay. For, as I
came out of my room, it happened that Colonel Wragge and the doctor
were going downstairs together, and their words floated up to my ears
before I could make my presence known by so much as a cough.

â€œThen you must find a way,â€ the doctor was saying with decision; â€œfor
I cannot insist too strongly upon that--and at all costs she must be
kept quiet. These attempts to go out must be prevented--if necessary,
by force. This desire to visit some wood or other she keeps talking
about is, of course, hysterical in nature. It cannot be permitted for a
moment.â€

â€œIt shall not be permitted,â€ I heard the soldier reply, as they reached
the hall below.

â€œIt has impressed her mind for some reason----â€ the doctor went on, by
way evidently of soothing explanation, and then the distance made it
impossible for me to hear more.

At dinner Dr. Silence was still absent, on the public plea of a
headache, and though food was sent to his room, I am inclined to
believe he did not touch it, but spent the entire time fasting.

We retired early, desiring that the household should do likewise, and
I must confess that at ten oâ€™clock when I bid my host a temporary
good-night, and sought my room to make what mental preparation I could,
I realised in no very pleasant fashion that it was a singular and
formidable assignation, this midnight meeting in the laundry building,
and that there were moments in every adventure of life when a wise
man, and one who knew his own limitations, owed it to his dignity
to withdraw discreetly. And, but for the character of our leader, I
probably should have then and there offered the best excuse I could
think of, and have allowed myself quietly to fall asleep and wait for
an exciting story in the morning of what had happened. But with a man
like John Silence, such a lapse was out of the question, and I sat
before my fire counting the minutes and doing everything I could think
of to fortify my resolution and fasten my will at the point where I
could be reasonably sure that my self-control would hold against all
attacks of men, devils, or elementals.


III

At a quarter before midnight, clad in a heavy ulster, and with
slippered feet, I crept cautiously from my room and stole down the
passage to the top of the stairs. Outside the doctorâ€™s door I waited
a moment to listen. All was still; the house in utter darkness; no
gleam of light beneath any door; only, down the length of the corridor,
from the direction of the sick-room, came faint sounds of laughter
and incoherent talk that were not things to reassure a mind already
half a-tremble, and I made haste to reach the hall and let myself out
through the front door into the night.

The air was keen and frosty, perfumed with night smells, and
exquisitely fresh; all the million candles of the sky were alight, and
a faint breeze rose and fell with far-away sighings in the tops of the
pine trees. My blood leaped for a moment in the spaciousness of the
night, for the splendid stars brought courage; but the next instant,
as I turned the corner of the house, moving stealthily down the gravel
drive, my spirits sank again ominously. For, yonder, over the funereal
plumes of the Twelve Acre Plantation, I saw the huge and yellow face
of the full moon just rising in the east, staring down like some vast
Being come to watch upon the progress of our doom. Seen through the
distorting vapours of the earthâ€™s atmosphere, her face looked weirdly
unfamiliar, her usual expression of benignant vacancy somehow a-twist.
I slipped along by the shadows of the wall, keeping my eyes upon the
ground.

The laundry-house, as already described, stood detached from the other
offices, with laurel shrubberies crowding thickly behind it, and the
kitchen-garden so close on the other side that the strong smells of
soil and growing things came across almost heavily. The shadows of the
haunted plantation, hugely lengthened by the rising moon behind them,
reached to the very walls and covered the stone tiles of the roof with
a dark pall. So keenly were my senses alert at this moment that I
believe I could fill a chapter with the endless small details of the
impression I received--shadows, odour, shapes, sounds--in the space of
the few seconds I stood and waited before the closed wooden door.

Then I became aware of some one moving towards me through the
moonlight, and the figure of John Silence, without overcoat and
bareheaded, came quickly and without noise to join me. His eyes, I saw
at once, were wonderfully bright, and so marked was the shining pallor
of his face that I could hardly tell when he passed from the moonlight
into the shade.

He passed without a word, beckoning me to follow, and then pushed the
door open, and went in.

The chill air of the place met us like that of an underground vault;
and the brick floor and whitewashed walls, streaked with damp and
smoke, threw back the cold in our faces. Directly opposite gaped the
black throat of the huge open fireplace, the ashes of wood fires
still piled and scattered about the hearth, and on either side of
the projecting chimney-column were the deep recesses holding the big
twin cauldrons for boiling clothes. Upon the lids of these cauldrons
stood the two little oil lamps, shaded red, which gave all the light
there was, and immediately in front of the fireplace there was a small
circular table with three chairs set about it. Overhead, the narrow
slit windows, high up the walls, pointed to a dim network of wooden
rafters half lost among the shadows, and then came the dark vault of
the roof. Cheerless and unalluring, for all the red light, it certainly
was, reminding me of some unused conventicle, bare of pews or pulpit,
ugly and severe, and I was forcibly struck by the contrast between the
normal uses to which the place was ordinarily put, and the strange and
mediÃ¦val purpose which had brought us under its roof to-night.

Possibly an involuntary shudder ran over me, for my companion turned
with a confident look to reassure me, and he was so completely master
of himself that I at once absorbed from his abundance, and felt the
chinks of my failing courage beginning to close up. To meet his eye in
the presence of danger was like finding a mental railing that guided
and supported thought along the giddy edges of alarm.

â€œI am quite ready,â€ I whispered, turning to listen for approaching
footsteps.

He nodded, still keeping his eyes on mine. Our whispers sounded hollow
as they echoed overhead among the rafters.

â€œIâ€™m glad you are here,â€ he said. â€œNot all would have the courage.
Keep your thoughts controlled, and imagine the protective shell round
you--round your _inner_ being.â€

â€œIâ€™m all right,â€ I repeated, cursing my chattering teeth.

He took my hand and shook it, and the contact seemed to shake into me
something of his supreme confidence. The eyes and hands of a strong man
can touch the soul. I think he guessed my thought, for a passing smile
flashed about the corners of his mouth.

â€œYou will feel more comfortable,â€ he said, in a low tone, â€œwhen
the chain is complete. The Colonel we can count on, of course.
Remember, though,â€ he added warningly, â€œhe may perhaps become
controlled--possessed--when the thing comes, because he wonâ€™t know how
to resist. And to explain the business to such a man----!â€ He shrugged
his shoulders expressively. â€œBut it will only be temporary, and I will
see that no harm comes to him.â€

He glanced round at the arrangements with approval.

â€œRed light,â€ he said, indicating the shaded lamps, â€œhas the lowest rate
of vibration. Materialisations are dissipated by strong light--wonâ€™t
form, or hold together--in rapid vibrations.â€

I was not sure that I approved altogether of this dim light, for in
complete darkness there is something protective--the knowledge that one
cannot be seen, probably--which a half-light destroys, but I remembered
the warning to keep my thoughts steady, and forbore to give them
expression.

There was a step outside, and the figure of Colonel Wragge stood in the
doorway. Though entering on tiptoe, he made considerable noise and
clatter, for his free movements were impeded by the burden he carried,
and we saw a large yellowish bowl held out at armsâ€™ length from his
body, the mouth covered with a white cloth. His face, I noted, was
rigidly composed. He, too, was master of himself. And, as I thought of
this old soldier moving through the long series of alarms, worn with
watching and wearied with assault, unenlightened yet undismayed, even
down to the dreadful shock of his sisterâ€™s terror, and still showing
the dogged pluck that persists in the face of defeat, I understood what
Dr. Silence meant when he described him as a man â€œto be counted on.â€

I think there was nothing beyond this rigidity of his stern features,
and a certain greyness of the complexion, to betray the turmoil of the
emotions that was doubtless going on within; and the quality of these
two men, each in his own way, so keyed me up that, by the time the door
was shut and we had exchanged silent greetings, all the latent courage
I possessed was well to the fore, and I felt as sure of myself as I
knew I ever could feel.

Colonel Wragge set the bowl carefully in the centre of the table.

â€œMidnight,â€ he said shortly, glancing at his watch, and we all three
moved to our chairs.

There, in the middle of that cold and silent place, we sat, with
the vile bowl before us, and a thin, hardly perceptible steam
rising through the damp air from the surface of the white cloth and
disappearing upwards the moment it passed beyond the zone of red light
and entered the deep shadows thrown forward by the projecting wall of
chimney.

The doctor had indicated our respective places, and I found myself
seated with my back to the door and opposite the black hearth. The
Colonel was on my left, and Dr. Silence on my right, both half facing
me, the latter more in shadow than the former. We thus divided the
little table into even sections, and sitting back in our chairs we
awaited events in silence.

For something like an hour I do not think there was even the faintest
sound within those four walls and under the canopy of that vaulted
roof. Our slippers made no scratching on the gritty floor, and our
breathing was suppressed almost to nothing; even the rustle of our
clothes as we shifted from time to time upon our seats was inaudible.
Silence smothered us absolutely--the silence of night, of listening,
the silence of a haunted expectancy. The very gurgling of the lamps was
too soft to be heard, and if light itself had sound, I do not think we
should have noticed the silvery tread of the moonlight as it entered
the high narrow windows and threw upon the floor the slender traces of
its pallid footsteps.

Colonel Wragge and the doctor, and myself too for that matter, sat thus
like figures of stone, without speech and without gesture. My eyes
passed in ceaseless journeys from the bowl to their faces, and from
their faces to the bowl. They might have been masks, however, for all
the signs of life they gave; and the light steaming from the horrid
contents beneath the white cloth had long ceased to be visible.

Then presently, as the moon rose higher, the wind rose with it. It
sighed, like the lightest of passing wings, over the roof; it crept
most softly round the walls; it made the brick floor like ice beneath
our feet. With it I saw mentally the desolate moorland flowing like
a sea about the old house, the treeless expanse of lonely hills, the
nearer copses, sombre, and mysterious in the night. _The_ plantation,
too, in particular I saw, and imagined I heard the mournful whisperings
that must now be a-stirring among its tree-tops as the breeze played
down between the twisted stems. In the depth of the room behind us the
shafts of moonlight met and crossed in a growing network.

It was after an hour of this wearing and unbroken attention, and I
should judge about one oâ€™clock in the morning, when the baying of
the dogs in the stable-yard first began, and I saw John Silence move
suddenly in his chair and sit up in an attitude of attention. Every
force in my being instantly leaped into the keenest vigilance. Colonel
Wragge moved too, though slowly, and without raising his eyes from the
table before him.

The doctor stretched his arm out and took the white cloth from the bowl.

It was perhaps imagination that persuaded me the red glare of the lamps
grew fainter and the air over the table before us thickened. I had been
expecting something for so long that the movement of my companions,
and the lifting of the cloth, may easily have caused the momentary
delusion that something hovered in the air before my face, touching
the skin of my cheeks with a silken run. But it was certainly not a
delusion that the Colonel looked up at the same moment and glanced over
his shoulder, as though his eyes followed the movements of something
to and fro about the room, and that he then buttoned his overcoat more
tightly about him and his eyes sought my own face first, and then the
doctorâ€™s. And it was no delusion that his face seemed somehow to have
turned dark, become spread as it were with a shadowy blackness. I saw
his lips tighten and his expression grow hard and stern, and it came to
me then with a rush that, of course, this man had told us but a part of
the experiences he had been through in the house, and that there was
much more he had never been able to bring himself to reveal at all.
I felt sure of it. The way he turned and stared about him betrayed a
familiarity with other things than those he had described to us. It was
not merely a sight of fire he looked for; it was a sight of something
alive, intelligent, something able to evade his searching; it was _a
person_. It was the watch for the ancient Being who sought to obsess
him.

And the way in which Dr. Silence answered his look--though it was only
by a glance of subtlest sympathy--confirmed my impression.

â€œWe may be ready now,â€ I heard him say in a whisper, and I understood
that his words were intended as a steadying warning, and braced myself
mentally to the utmost of my power.

Yet long before Colonel Wragge had turned to stare about the room, and
long before the doctor had confirmed my impression that things were at
last beginning to stir, I had become aware in most singular fashion
that the place held more than our three selves. With the rising of the
wind this increase to our numbers had first taken place. The baying of
the hounds almost seemed to have signalled it. I cannot say how it may
be possible to realise that an empty place has suddenly become--not
empty, when the new arrival is nothing that appeals to any one of the
senses; for this recognition of an â€œinvisible,â€ as of the change in the
balance of personal forces in a human group, is indefinable and beyond
proof. Yet it is unmistakable. And I knew perfectly well at what given
moment the atmosphere within these four walls became charged with the
presence of other living beings besides ourselves. And, on reflection,
I am convinced that both my companions knew it too.

â€œWatch the light,â€ said the doctor under his breath, and, then I knew
too that it was no fancy of my own that had turned the air darker, and
the way he turned to examine the face of our host sent an electric
thrill of wonder and expectancy shivering along every nerve in my body.

Yet it was no kind of terror that I experienced, but rather a sort of
mental dizziness, and a sensation as of being suspended in some remote
and dreadful altitude where things might happen, indeed were about to
happen, that had never before happened within the ken of man. Horror
may have formed an ingredient, but it was not chiefly horror, and in no
sense ghostly horror.

Uncommon thoughts kept beating on my brain like tiny hammers, soft yet
persistent, seeking admission; their unbidden tide began to wash along
the far fringes of my mind, the currents of unwonted sensations to rise
over the remote frontiers of my consciousness. I was aware of thoughts,
and the fantasies of thoughts, that I never knew before existed.
Portions of my being stirred that had never stirred before, and things
ancient and inexplicable rose to the surface and beckoned me to follow.
I felt as though I were about to fly off, at some immense tangent,
into an outer space hitherto unknown even in dreams. And so singular
was the result produced upon me that I was uncommonly glad to anchor my
mind, as well as my eyes, upon the masterful personality of the doctor
at my side, for there, I realised, I could draw always upon the forces
of sanity and safety.

With a vigorous effort of will I returned to the scene before me, and
tried to focus my attention, with steadier thoughts, upon the table,
and upon the silent figures seated round it. And then I saw that
certain changes had come about in the place where we sat.

The patches of moonlight on the floor, I noted, had become curiously
shaded; the faces of my companions opposite were not so clearly
visible as before; and the forehead and cheeks of Colonel Wragge were
glistening with perspiration. I realised further, that an extraordinary
change had come about in the temperature of the atmosphere. The
increased warmth had a painful effect, not alone on Colonel Wragge, but
upon all of us. It was oppressive and unnatural. We gasped figuratively
as well as actually.

â€œYou are the first to feel it,â€ said Dr. Silence in low tones, looking
across at him. â€œYou are in more intimate touch, of course----â€

The Colonel was trembling, and appeared to be in considerable distress.
His knees shook, so that the shuffling of his slippered feet became
audible. He inclined his head to show that he had heard, but made no
other reply. I think, even then, he was sore put to it to keep himself
in hand. I knew what he was struggling against. As Dr. Silence had
warned me, he was about to be obsessed, and was savagely, though
vainly, resisting.

But, meanwhile, a curious and whirling sense of exhilaration began
to come over me. The increasing heat was delightful, bringing a
sensation of intense activity, of thoughts pouring through the mind
at high speed, of vivid pictures in the brain, of fierce desires and
lightning energies alive in every part of the body. I was conscious of
no physical distress, such as the Colonel felt, but only of a vague
feeling that it might all grow suddenly too intense--that I might be
consumed--that my personality as well as my body, might become resolved
into the flame of pure spirit. I began to live at a speed too intense
to last. It was as if a thousand ecstasies besieged me----

â€œSteady!â€ whispered the voice of John Silence in my ear, and I looked
up with a start to see that the Colonel had risen from his chair. The
doctor rose too. I followed suit, and for the first time saw down into
the bowl. To my amazement and horror I saw that the contents were
troubled. The blood was astir with movement.

The rest of the experiment was witnessed by us standing. It came, too,
with a curious suddenness. There was no more dreaming, for me at any
rate.

I shall never forget the figure of Colonel Wragge standing there beside
me, upright and unshaken, squarely planted on his feet, looking about
him, puzzled beyond belief, yet full of a fighting anger. Framed by
the white walls, the red glow of the lamps upon his streaming cheeks,
his eyes glowing against the deathly pallor of his skin, breathing
hard and making convulsive efforts of hands and body to keep himself
under control, his whole being roused to the point of savage fighting,
yet with nothing visible to get at anywhere--he stood there, immovable
against odds. And the strange contrast of the pale skin and the burning
face I had never seen before, or wish to seen again.

But what has left an even sharper impression on my memory was the
blackness that then began crawling over his face, obliterating the
features, concealing their human outline, and hiding him inch by
inch from view. This was my first realisation that the process of
materialisation was at work. His visage became shrouded. I moved from
one side to the other to keep him in view, and it was only then I
understood that, properly speaking, the blackness was not upon the
countenance of Colonel Wragge, but that something had inserted itself
between me and him, thus screening his face with the effect of a dark
veil. Something that apparently rose through the floor was passing
slowly into the air above the table and above the bowl. The blood in
the bowl, moreover, was considerably less than before.

And, with this change in the air before us, there came at the same
time a further change, I thought, in the face of the soldier. One-half
was turned towards the red lamps, while the other caught the pale
illumination of the moonlight falling aslant from the high windows,
so that it was difficult to estimate this change with accuracy of
detail. But it seemed to me that, while the features--eyes, nose,
mouth--remained the same, the life informing them had undergone some
profound transformation. The signature of a new power had crept into
the face and left its traces there--an expression dark, and in some
unexplained way, terrible.

Then suddenly he opened his mouth and spoke, and the sound of this
changed voice, deep and musical though it was, made me cold and set
my heart beating with uncomfortable rapidity. The Being, as he had
dreaded, was already in control of his brain, using his mouth.

â€œI see a blackness like the blackness of Egypt before my face,â€ said
the tones of this unknown voice that seemed half his own and half
anotherâ€™s. â€œAnd out of this darkness they come, they come.â€

I gave a dreadful start. The doctor turned to look at me for an
instant, and then turned to centre his attention upon the figure of our
host, and I understood in some intuitive fashion that he was there to
watch over the strangest contest man ever saw--to watch over and, if
necessary, to protect.

â€œHe is being controlled--possessed,â€ he whispered to me through the
shadows. His face wore a wonderful expression, half triumph, half
admiration.

Even as Colonel Wragge spoke, it seemed to me that this visible
darkness began to increase, pouring up thickly out of the ground by
the hearth, rising up in sheets and veils, shrouding our eyes and
faces. It stole up from below--an awful blackness that seemed to drink
in all the radiations of light in the building, leaving nothing but
the ghost of a radiance in their place. Then, out of this rising sea
of shadows, issued a pale and spectral light that gradually spread
itself about us, and from the heart of this light I saw the shapes of
fire crowd and gather. And these were not human shapes, or the shapes
of anything I recognised as alive in the world, but outlines of fire
that traced globes, triangles, crosses, and the luminous bodies of
various geometrical figures. They grew bright, faded, and then grew
bright again with an effect almost of pulsation. They passed swiftly
to and fro through the air, rising and falling, and particularly in
the immediate neighbourhood of the Colonel, often gathering about his
head and shoulders, and even appearing to settle upon him like giant
insects of flame. They were accompanied, moreover, by a faint sound of
hissing--the same sound we had heard that afternoon in the plantation.

â€œThe fire-elementals that precede their master,â€ the doctor said in an
undertone. â€œBe ready.â€

And while this weird display of the shapes of fire alternately flashed
and faded, and the hissing echoed faintly among the dim rafters
overhead, we heard the awful voice issue at intervals from the lips of
the afflicted soldier. It was a voice of power, splendid in some way I
cannot describe, and with a certain sense of majesty in its cadences,
and, as I listened to it with quickly-beating heart, I could fancy it
was some ancient voice of Time itself, echoing down immense corridors
of stone, from the depths of vast temples, from the very heart of
mountain tombs.

â€œI have seen my divine Father, Osiris,â€ thundered the great tones. â€œI
have scattered the gloom of the night. I have burst through the earth,
and am one with the starry Deities!â€

Something grand came into the soldierâ€™s face. He was staring fixedly
before him, as though seeing nothing.

â€œWatch,â€ whispered Dr. Silence in my ear, and his whisper seemed to
come from very far away.

Again the mouth opened and the awesome voice issued forth.

â€œThoth,â€ it boomed, â€œhas loosened the bandages of Set which fettered my
mouth. I have taken my place in the great winds of heaven.â€

I heard the little wind of night, with its mournful voice of ages,
sighing round the walls and over the roof.

â€œListen!â€ came from the doctor at my side, and the thunder of the voice
continued--

â€œI have hidden myself with you, O ye stars that never diminish. I
remember my name--in--the--House--of--Fire!â€

The voice ceased and the sound died away. Something about the face and
figure of Colonel Wragge relaxed, I thought. The terrible look passed
from his face. The Being that obsessed him was gone.

â€œThe great Ritual,â€ said Dr. Silence aside to me, very low, â€œthe Book
of the Dead. Now itâ€™s leaving him. Soon the blood will fashion it a
body.â€

Colonel Wragge, who had stood absolutely motionless all this time,
suddenly swayed, so that I thought he was going to fall,--and, but for
the quick support of the doctorâ€™s arm, he probably would have fallen,
for he staggered as in the beginning of collapse.

â€œI am drunk with the wine of Osiris,â€ he cried,--and it was half with
his own voice this time--â€œbut Horus, the Eternal Watcher, is about my
path--for--safety.â€ The voice dwindled and failed, dying away into
something almost like a cry of distress.

â€œNow, watch closely,â€ said Dr. Silence, speaking loud, â€œfor after the
cry will come the Fire!â€

I began to tremble involuntarily; an awful change had come without
warning into the air; my legs grew weak as paper beneath my weight and
I had to support myself by leaning on the table. Colonel Wragge, I
saw, was also leaning forward with a kind of droop. The shapes of fire
had vanished all, but his face was lit by the red lamps and the pale
shifting moonlight rose behind him like mist.

We were both gazing at the bowl, now almost empty; the Colonel stooped
so low I feared every minute he would lose his balance and drop into
it; and the shadow, that had so long been in process of forming, now at
length began to assume material outline in the air before us.

Then John Silence moved forward quickly. He took his place between us
and the shadow. Erect, formidable, absolute master of the situation, I
saw him stand there, his face calm and almost smiling, and fire in his
eyes. His protective influence was astounding and incalculable. Even
the abhorrent dread I felt at the sight of the creature growing into
life and substance before us, lessened in some way so that I was able
to keep my eyes fixed on the air above the bowl without too vivid a
terror.

But as it took shape, rising out of nothing as it were, and growing
momentarily more defined in outline, a period of utter and wonderful
silence settled down upon the building and all it contained. A hush of
ages, like the sudden centre of peace at the heart of the travelling
cyclone, descended through the night, and out of this hush, as out of
the emanations of the steaming blood, issued the form of the ancient
being who had first sent the elemental of fire upon its mission. It
grew and darkened and solidified before our eyes. It rose from just
beyond the table so that the lower portions remained invisible, but I
saw the outline limn itself upon the air, as though slowly revealed by
the rising of a curtain. It apparently had not then quite concentrated
to the normal proportions, but was spread out on all sides into space,
huge, though rapidly condensing, for I saw the colossal shoulders, the
neck, the lower portion of the dark jaws, the terrible mouth, and then
the teeth and lips--and, as the veil seemed to lift further upon the
tremendous face--I saw the nose and cheek bones. In another moment I
should have looked straight into the eyes----

But what Dr. Silence did at that moment was so unexpected, and took me
so by surprise, that I have never yet properly understood its nature,
and he has never yet seen fit to explain in detail to me. He uttered
some sound that had a note of command in it--and, in so doing, stepped
forward and intervened between me and the face. The figure, just
nearing completeness, he therefore hid from my sight--and I have always
thought purposely hid from my sight.

â€œThe fire!â€ he cried out. â€œThe fire! Beware!â€

There was a sudden roar as of flame from the very mouth of the pit,
and for the space of a single second all grew light as day. A blinding
flash passed across my face, and there was heat for an instant that
seemed to shrivel skin, and flesh, and bone. Then came steps, and I
heard Colonel Wragge utter a great cry, wilder than any human cry I
have ever known. The heat sucked all the breath out of my lungs with a
rush, and the blaze of light, as it vanished, swept my vision with it
into enveloping darkness.

When I recovered the use of my senses a few moments later I saw that
Colonel Wragge with a face of death, its whiteness strangely stained,
had moved closer to me. Dr. Silence stood beside him, an expression of
triumph and success in his eyes. The next minute the soldier tried to
clutch me with his hand. Then he reeled, staggered, and, unable to save
himself, fell with a great crash upon the brick floor.

After the sheet of flame, a wind raged round the building as though it
would lift the roof off, but then passed as suddenly as it came. And in
the intense calm that followed I saw that the form had vanished, and
the doctor was stooping over Colonel Wragge upon the floor, trying to
lift him to a sitting position.

â€œLight,â€ he said quietly, â€œmore light. Take the shades off.â€

Colonel Wragge sat up and the glare of the unshaded lamps fell upon
his face. It was grey and drawn, still running heat, and there was a
look in the eyes and about the corners of the mouth that seemed in this
short space of time to have added years to its age. At the same time,
the expression of effort and anxiety had left it. It showed relief.

â€œGone!â€ he said, looking up at the doctor in a dazed fashion, and
struggling to his feet. â€œThank God! itâ€™s gone at last.â€ He stared
round the laundry as though to find out where he was. â€œDid it control
me--take possession of me? Did I talk nonsense?â€ he asked bluntly.
â€œAfter the heat came, I remember nothing----â€

â€œYouâ€™ll feel yourself again in a few minutes,â€ the doctor said. To my
infinite horror I saw that he was surreptitiously wiping sundry dark
stains from the face. â€œOur experiment has been a success and----â€

He gave me a swift glance to hide the bowl, standing between me and our
host while I hurriedly stuffed it down under the lid of the nearest
cauldron.

â€œ----and none of us the worse for it,â€ he finished.

â€œAnd fires?â€ he asked, still dazed, â€œthereâ€™ll be no more fires?â€

â€œIt is dissipated--partly, at any rate,â€ replied Dr. Silence cautiously.

â€œAnd the man behind the gun,â€ he went on, only half realising what he
was saying, I think; â€œhave you discovered _that_?â€

â€œA form materialised,â€ said the doctor briefly. â€œI know for certain now
what the directing intelligence was behind it all.â€

Colonel Wragge pulled himself together and got upon his feet. The words
conveyed no clear meaning to him yet. But his memory was returning
gradually, and he was trying to piece together the fragments into a
connected whole. He shivered a little, for the place had grown suddenly
chilly. The air was empty again, lifeless.

â€œYou feel all right again now,â€ Dr. Silence said, in the tone of a man
stating a fact rather than asking a question.

â€œThanks to you--both, yes.â€ He drew a deep breath, and mopped his face,
and even attempted a smile. He made me think of a man coming from the
battlefield with the stains of fighting still upon him, but scornful of
his wounds. Then he turned gravely towards the doctor with a question
in his eyes. Memory had returned and he was himself again.

â€œPrecisely what I expected,â€ the doctor said calmly; â€œa fire-elemental
sent upon its mission in the days of Thebes, centuries before Christ,
and to-night, for the first time all these thousands of years, released
from the spell that originally bound it.â€

We stared at him in amazement, Colonel Wragge opening his lips for
words that refused to shape themselves.

â€œAnd, if we dig,â€ he continued significantly, pointing to the floor
where the blackness had poured up, â€œwe shall find some underground
connection--a tunnel most likely--leading to the Twelve Acre Wood. It
was made by--your predecessor.â€

â€œA tunnel made by my brother!â€ gasped the soldier. â€œThen my sister
should know--she lived here with him----â€ He stopped suddenly.

John Silence inclined his head slowly. â€œI think so,â€ he said quietly.
â€œYour brother, no doubt, was as much tormented as you have been,â€
he continued after a pause in which Colonel Wragge seemed deeply
preoccupied with his thoughts, â€œand tried to find peace by burying it
in the wood, and surrounding the wood then, like a large magic circle,
with the enchantments of the old formulÃ¦. So the stars the man saw
blazing----â€

â€œBut burying _what_?â€ asked the soldier faintly, stepping backwards
towards the support of the wall.

Dr. Silence regarded us both intently for a moment before he replied.
I think he weighed in his mind whether to tell us now, or when the
investigation was absolutely complete.

â€œThe mummy,â€ he said softly, after a moment; â€œthe mummy that your
brother took from its resting-place of centuries, and brought
home--here.â€

Colonel Wragge dropped down upon the nearest chair, hanging
breathlessly on every word. He was far too amazed for speech.

â€œThe mummy of some important person--a priest most likely--protected
from disturbance and desecration by the ceremonial magic of the time.
For they understood how to attach to the mummy, to lock up with it in
the tomb, an elemental force that would direct itself even after ages
upon any one who dared to molest it. In this case it was an elemental
of fire.â€

Dr. Silence crossed the floor and turned out the lamps one by one. He
had nothing more to say for the moment. Following his example, I folded
the table together and took up the chairs, and our host, still dazed
and silent, mechanically obeyed him and moved to the door.

We removed all traces of the experiment, taking the empty bowl back to
the house concealed beneath an ulster.

The air was cool and fragrant as we walked to the house, the stars
beginning to fade overhead and a fresh wind of early morning blowing up
out of the east where the sky was already hinting of the coming day. It
was after five oâ€™clock.

Stealthily we entered the front hall and locked the door, and as we
went on tiptoe upstairs to our rooms, the Colonel, peering at us over
his candle as he nodded good-night, whispered that if we were ready
the digging should be begun that very day.

Then I saw him steal along to his sisterâ€™s room and disappear.


IV

But not even the mysterious references to the mummy, or the prospect of
a revelation by digging, were able to hinder the reaction that followed
the intense excitement of the past twelve hours, and I slept the sleep
of the dead, dreamless and undisturbed. A touch on the shoulder woke
me, and I saw Dr. Silence standing beside the bed, dressed to go out.

â€œCome,â€ he said, â€œitâ€™s tea-time. Youâ€™ve slept the best part of a dozen
hours.â€

I sprang up and made a hurried toilet, while my companion sat and
talked. He looked fresh and rested, and his manner was even quieter
than usual.

â€œColonel Wragge has provided spades and pickaxes. Weâ€™re going out to
unearth this mummy at once,â€ he said; â€œand thereâ€™s no reason we should
not get away by the morning train.â€

â€œIâ€™m ready to go to-night, if you are,â€ I said honestly.

But Dr. Silence shook his head.

â€œI must see this through to the end,â€ he said gravely, and in a tone
that made me think he still anticipated serious things, perhaps. He
went on talking while I dressed.

â€œThis case is really typical of all stories of mummy-haunting, and
none of them are cases to trifle with,â€ he explained, â€œfor the mummies
of important people--kings, priests, magicians--were laid away with
profoundly significant ceremonial, and were very effectively protected,
as you have seen, against desecration, and especially against
destruction.

â€œThe general belief,â€ he went on, anticipating my questions, â€œheld,
of course, that the perpetuity of the mummy guaranteed that of its
Ka,--the ownerâ€™s spirit,--but it is not improbable that the magical
embalming was also used to retard reincarnation, the preservation of
the body preventing the return of the spirit to the toil and discipline
of earth-life; and, in any case, they knew how to attach powerful
guardian-forces to keep off trespassers. And any one who dared to
remove the mummy, or especially to unwind it--well,â€ he added, with
meaning, â€œyou have seen--and you _will_ see.â€

I caught his face in the mirror while I struggled with my collar. It
was deeply serious. There could be no question that he spoke of what he
believed and knew.

â€œThe traveller-brother who brought it here must have been haunted too,â€
he continued, â€œfor he tried to banish it by burial in the wood, making
a magic circle to enclose it. Something of genuine ceremonial he must
have known, for the stars the man saw were of course the remains of the
still flaming pentagrams he traced at intervals in the circle. Only he
did not know enough, or possibly was ignorant that the mummyâ€™s guardian
was a fire-force. Fire cannot be enclosed by fire, though, as you saw,
it can be released by it.â€

â€œThen that awful figure in the laundry?â€ I asked, thrilled to find him
so communicative.

â€œUndoubtedly the actual Ka of the mummy operating always behind its
agent, the elemental, and most likely thousands of years old.â€

â€œAnd Miss Wragge----?â€ I ventured once more.

â€œAh, Miss Wragge,â€ he repeated with increased gravity, â€œMiss Wragge----â€

A knock at the door brought a servant with word that tea was ready,
and the Colonel had sent to ask if we were coming down. The thread was
broken. Dr. Silence moved to the door and signed to me to follow. But
his manner told me that in any case no real answer would have been
forthcoming to my question.

â€œAnd the place to dig in,â€ I asked, unable to restrain my curiosity,
â€œwill you find it by some process of divination or----?â€

He paused at the door and looked back at me, and with that he left me
to finish my dressing.

It was growing dark when the three of us silently made our way to the
Twelve Acre Plantation; the sky was overcast, and a black wind came out
of the east. Gloom hung about the old house and the air seemed full of
sighings. We found the tools ready laid at the edge of the wood, and
each shouldering his piece, we followed our leader at once in among the
trees. He went straight forward for some twenty yards and then stopped.
At his feet lay the blackened circle of one of the burned places. It
was just discernible against the surrounding white grass.

â€œThere are three of these,â€ he said, â€œand they all lie in a line with
one another. Any one of them will tap the tunnel that connects the
laundry--the former Museum--with the chamber where the mummy now lies
buried.â€

He at once cleared away the burnt grass and began to dig; we all began
to dig. While I used the pick, the others shovelled vigorously. No
one spoke. Colonel Wragge worked the hardest of the three. The soil
was light and sandy, and there were only a few snake-like roots and
occasional loose stones to delay us. The pick made short work of these.
And meanwhile the darkness settled about us and the biting wind swept
roaring through the trees overhead.

Then, quite suddenly, without a cry, Colonel Wragge disappeared up to
his neck.

â€œThe tunnel!â€ cried the doctor, helping to drag him out, red,
breathless, and covered with sand and perspiration. â€œNow, let me lead
the way.â€ And he slipped down nimbly into the hole, so that a moment
later we heard his voice, muffled by sand and distance, rising up to us.

â€œHubbard, you come next, and then Colonel Wragge--if he wishes,â€ we
heard.

â€œIâ€™ll follow you, of course,â€ he said, looking at me as I scrambled in.

The hole was bigger now, and I got down on all-fours in a channel not
much bigger than a large sewer-pipe and found myself in total darkness.
A minute later a heavy thud, followed by a cataract of loose sand,
announced the arrival of the Colonel.

â€œCatch hold of my heel,â€ called Dr. Silence, â€œand Colonel Wragge can
take yours.â€

In this slow, laborious fashion we wormed our way along a tunnel
that had been roughly dug out of the shifting sand, and was shored up
clumsily by means of wooden pillars and posts. Any moment, it seemed to
me, we might be buried alive. We could not see an inch before our eyes,
but had to grope our way feeling the pillars and the walls. It was
difficult to breathe, and the Colonel behind me made but slow progress,
for the cramped position of our bodies was very severe.

We had travelled in this way for ten minutes, and gone perhaps as much
as ten yards, when I lost my grasp of the doctorâ€™s heel.

â€œAh!â€ I heard his voice, sounding above me somewhere. He was standing
up in a clear space, and the next moment I was standing beside him.
Colonel Wragge came heavily after, and he too rose up and stood. Then
Dr. Silence produced his candles and we heard preparations for striking
matches.

Yet even before there was light, an indefinable sensation of awe came
over us all. In this hole in the sand, some three feet under ground,
we stood side by side, cramped and huddled, struck suddenly with an
overwhelming apprehension of something ancient, something formidable,
something incalculably wonderful, that touched in each one of us a
sense of the sublime and the terrible even before we could see an inch
before our faces. I know not how to express in language this singular
emotion that caught us here in utter darkness, touching no sense
directly, it seemed, yet with the recognition that before us in the
blackness of this underground night there lay something that was mighty
with the mightiness of long past ages.

I felt Colonel Wragge press in closely to my side, and I understood the
pressure and welcomed it. No human touch, to me at least, has ever been
more eloquent.

Then the match flared, a thousand shadows fled on black wings, and I
saw John Silence fumbling with the candle, his face lit up grotesquely
by the flickering light below it.

I had dreaded this light, yet when it came there was apparently nothing
to explain the profound sensations of dread that preceded it. We stood
in a small vaulted chamber in the sand, the sides and roof shored with
bars of wood, and the ground laid roughly with what seemed to be tiles.
It was six feet high, so that we could all stand comfortably, and may
have been ten feet long by eight feet wide. Upon the wooden pillars at
the side I saw that Egyptian hieroglyphics had been rudely traced by
burning.

Dr. Silence lit three candles and handed one to each of us. He placed a
fourth in the sand against the wall on his right, and another to mark
the entrance to the tunnel. We stood and stared about us, instinctively
holding our breath.

â€œEmpty, by God!â€ exclaimed Colonel Wragge. His voice trembled with
excitement. And then, as his eyes rested on the ground, he added, â€œAnd
footsteps--look--footsteps in the sand!â€

Dr. Silence said nothing. He stooped down and began to make a search
of the chamber, and as he moved, my eyes followed his crouching figure
and noted the queer distorted shadows that poured over the walls and
ceiling after him. Here and there thin trickles of loose sand ran
fizzing down the sides. The atmosphere, heavily charged with faint yet
pungent odours, lay utterly still, and the flames of the candles might
have been painted on the air for all the movement they betrayed.

And, as I watched, it was almost necessary to persuade myself forcibly
that I was only standing upright with difficulty in this little
sand-hole of a modern garden in the south of England, for it seemed to
me that I stood, as in vision, at the entrance of some vast rock-hewn
Temple far, far down the river of Time. The illusion was powerful,
and persisted. Granite columns, that rose to heaven, piled themselves
about me, majestically uprearing, and a roof like the sky itself spread
above a line of colossal figures that moved in shadowy procession along
endless and stupendous aisles. This huge and splendid fantasy, borne I
knew not whence, possessed me so vividly that I was actually obliged to
concentrate my attention upon the small stooping figure of the doctor,
as he groped about the walls, in order to keep the eye of imagination
on the scene before me.

But the limited space rendered a long search out of the question, and
his footsteps, instead of shuffling through loose sand, presently
struck something of a different quality that gave forth a hollow and
resounding echo. He stooped to examine more closely.

He was standing exactly in the centre of the little chamber when this
happened, and he at once began scraping away the sand with his feet. In
less than a minute a smooth surface became visible--the surface of a
wooden covering. The next thing I saw was that he had raised it and was
peering down into a space below. Instantly, a strong odour of nitre
and bitumen, mingled with the strange perfume of unknown and powdered
aromatics, rose up from the uncovered space and filled the vault,
stinging the throat and making the eyes water and smart.

â€œThe mummy!â€ whispered Dr. Silence, looking up into our faces over his
candle; and as he said the word I felt the soldier lurch against me,
and heard his breathing in my very ear.

â€œThe mummy!â€ he repeated under his breath, as we pressed forward to
look.

It is difficult to say exactly why the sight should have stirred in
me so prodigious an emotion of wonder and veneration, for I have had
not a little to do with mummies, have unwound scores of them, and even
experimented magically with not a few. But there was something in the
sight of that grey and silent figure, lying in its modern box of lead
and wood at the bottom of this sandy grave, swathed in the bandages of
centuries and wrapped in the perfumed linen that the priests of Egypt
had prayed over with their mighty enchantments thousands of years
before--something in the sight of it lying there and breathing its own
spice-laden atmosphere even in the darkness of its exile in this remote
land, something that pierced to the very core of my being and touched
that root of awe which slumbers in every man near the birth of tears
and the passion of true worship.

I remember turning quickly from the Colonel, lest he should see my
emotion, yet fail to understand its cause, turn and clutch John Silence
by the arm, and then fall trembling to see that he, too, had lowered
his head and was hiding his face in his hands.

A kind of whirling storm came over me, rising out of I know not what
utter deeps of memory, and in a whiteness of vision I heard the magical
old chauntings from the Book of the Dead, and saw the Gods pass by in
dim procession, the mighty, immemorial Beings who were yet themselves
only the personified attributes of the true Gods, the God with the
Eyes of Fire, the God with the Face of Smoke. I saw again Anubis, the
dog-faced deity, and the children of Horus, eternal watcher of the
ages, as they swathed Osiris, the first mummy of the world, in the
scented and mystic bands, and I tasted again something of the ecstasy
of the justified soul as it embarked in the golden Boat of Ra, and
journeyed onwards to rest in the fields of the blessed.

And then, as Dr. Silence, with infinite reverence, stooped and touched
the still face, so dreadfully staring with its painted eyes, there rose
again to our nostrils wave upon wave of this perfume of thousands of
years, and time fled backwards like a thing of naught, showing me in
haunted panorama the most wonderful dream of the whole world.

A gentle hissing became audible in the air, and the doctor moved
quickly backwards. It came close to our faces and then seemed to play
about the walls and ceiling.

â€œThe last of the Fire--still waiting for its full accomplishment,â€ he
muttered; but I heard both words and hissing as things far away, for I
was still busy with the journey of the soul through the Seven Halls of
Death, listening for echoes of the grandest ritual ever known to men.

The earthen plates covered with hieroglyphics still lay beside the
mummy, and round it, carefully arranged at the points of the compass,
stood the four jars with the heads of the hawk, the jackal, the
cynocephalus, and man, the jars in which were placed the hair, the nail
parings, the heart, and other special portions of the body. Even the
amulets, the mirror, the blue clay statues of the Ka, and the lamp with
seven wicks were there. Only the sacred scarabÃ¦us was missing.

â€œNot only has it been torn from its ancient resting-place,â€ I heard Dr.
Silence saying in a solemn voice as he looked at Colonel Wragge with
fixed gaze, â€œbut it has been partially unwound,â€--he pointed to the
wrappings of the breast,--â€œand--the scarabÃ¦us has been removed from the
throat.â€

The hissing, that was like the hissing of an invisible flame, had
ceased; only from time to time we heard it as though it passed
backwards and forwards in the tunnel; and we stood looking into each
otherâ€™s faces without speaking.

Presently Colonel Wragge made a great effort and braced himself. I
heard the sound catch in his throat before the words actually became
audible.

â€œMy sister,â€ he said, very low. And then there followed a long pause,
broken at length by John Silence.

â€œIt must be replaced,â€ he said significantly.

â€œI knew nothing,â€ the soldier said, forcing himself to speak the words
he hated saying. â€œAbsolutely nothing.â€

â€œIt must be returned,â€ repeated the other, â€œif it is not now too late.
For I fear--I fear----â€

Colonel Wragge made a movement of assent with his head.

â€œIt shall be,â€ he said.

The place was still as the grave.

I do not know what it was then that made us all three turn round with
so sudden a start, for there was no sound audible to my ears, at least.

The doctor was on the point of replacing the lid over the mummy, when
he straightened up as if he had been shot.

â€œThereâ€™s something coming,â€ said Colonel Wragge under his breath, and
the doctorâ€™s eyes, peering down the small opening of the tunnel, showed
me the true direction.

A distant shuffling noise became distinctly audible coming from a point
about half-way down the tunnel we had so laboriously penetrated.

â€œItâ€™s the sand falling in,â€ I said, though I knew it was foolish.

â€œNo,â€ said the Colonel calmly, in a voice that seemed to have the ring
of iron, â€œIâ€™ve heard it for some time past. It is something alive--and
it is coming nearer.â€

He stared about him with a look of resolution that made his face almost
noble. The horror in his heart was overmastering, yet he stood there
prepared for anything that might come.

â€œThereâ€™s no other way out,â€ John Silence said.

He leaned the lid against the sand, and waited. I knew by the mask-like
expression of his face, the pallor, and the steadiness of the eyes,
that he anticipated something that might be very terrible--appalling.

The Colonel and myself stood on either side of the opening. I still
held my candle and was ashamed of the way it shook, dripping the
grease all over me; but the soldier had set his into the sand just
behind his feet.

Thoughts of being buried alive, of being smothered like rats in a trap,
of being caught and done to death by some invisible and merciless force
we could not grapple with, rushed into my mind. Then I thought of
fire--of suffocation--of being roasted alive. The perspiration began to
pour from my face.

â€œSteady!â€ came the voice of Dr. Silence to me through the vault.

For five minutes, that seemed fifty, we stood waiting, looking from
each otherâ€™s faces to the mummy, and from the mummy to the hole, and
all the time the shuffling sound, soft and stealthy, came gradually
nearer. The tension, for me at least, was very near the breaking point
when at last the cause of the disturbance reached the edge. It was
hidden for a moment just behind the broken rim of soil. A jet of sand,
shaken by the close vibration, trickled down on to the ground; I have
never in my life seen anything fall with such laborious leisure. The
next second, uttering a cry of curious quality, it came into view.

And it was far more distressingly horrible than anything I had
anticipated.

For the sight of some Egyptian monster, some god of the tombs, or
even of some demon of fire, I think I was already half prepared; but
when, instead, I saw the white visage of Miss Wragge framed in that
round opening of sand, followed by her body crawling on all-fours, her
eyes bulging and reflecting the yellow glare of the candles, my first
instinct was to turn and run like a frantic animal seeking a way of
escape.

But Dr. Silence, who seemed no whit surprised, caught my arm and
steadied me, and we both saw the Colonel then drop upon his knees and
come thus to a level with his sister. For more than a whole minute, as
though struck in stone, the two faces gazed silently at each other:
herâ€™s, for all the dreadful emotion in it, more like a gargoyle than
anything human; and his, white and blank with an expression that was
beyond either astonishment or alarm. She looked up; he looked down. It
was a picture in a nightmare, and the candle, stuck in the sand close
to the hole, threw upon it the glare of impromptu footlights.

Then John Silence moved forward and spoke in a voice that was very low,
yet perfectly calm and natural.

â€œI am glad you have come,â€ he said. â€œYou are the one person whose
presence at this moment is most required. And I hope that you may yet
be in time to appease the anger of the Fire, and to bring peace again
to your household, and,â€ he added lower still so that no one heard it
but myself, â€œ_safety to yourself_.â€

And while her brother stumbled backwards, crushing a candle into the
sand in his awkwardness, the old lady crawled farther into the vaulted
chamber and slowly rose upon her feet.

At the sight of the wrapped figure of the mummy I was fully prepared
to see her scream and faint, but on the contrary, to my complete
amazement, she merely bowed her head and dropped quietly upon her
knees. Then, after a pause of more than a minute, she raised her eyes
to the roof and her lips began to mutter as in prayer. Her right hand,
meanwhile, which had been fumbling for some time at her throat,
suddenly came away, and before the gaze of all of us she held it out,
palm upwards, over the grey and ancient figure outstretched below. And
in it we beheld glistening the green jasper of the stolen scarabÃ¦us.

Her brother, leaning heavily against the wall behind, uttered a sound
that was half cry, half exclamation, but John Silence, standing
directly in front of her, merely fixed his eyes on her and pointed
downwards to the staring face below.

â€œReplace it,â€ he said sternly, â€œwhere it belongs.â€

Miss Wragge was kneeling at the feet of the mummy when this happened.
We three men all had our eyes riveted on what followed. Only the reader
who by some remote chance may have witnessed a line of mummies, freshly
laid from their tombs upon the sand, slowly stir and bend as the heat
of the Egyptian sun warms their ancient bodies into the semblance of
life, can form any conception of the ultimate horror we experienced
when the silent figure before us moved in its grave of lead and sand.
Slowly, before our eyes, it writhed, and, with a faint rustling of the
immemorial cerements, rose up, and, through sightless and bandaged
eyes, stared across the yellow candle-light at the woman who had
violated it.

I tried to move--her brother tried to move--but the sand seemed to hold
our feet. I tried to cry--her brother tried to cry--but the sand seemed
to fill our lungs and throat. We could only stare--and, even so, the
sand seemed to rise like a desert storm and cloud our vision....

And when I managed at length to open my eyes again, the mummy was lying
once more upon its back, motionless, the shrunken and painted face
upturned towards the ceiling, and the old lady had tumbled forward and
was lying in the semblance of death with her head and arms upon its
crumbling body.

But upon the wrappings of the throat I saw the green jasper of the
sacred scarabÃ¦us shining again like a living eye.

Colonel Wragge and the doctor recovered themselves long before I did,
and I found myself helping them clumsily and unintelligently to raise
the frail body of the old lady, while John Silence carefully replaced
the covering over the grave and scraped back the sand with his foot,
while he issued brief directions.

I heard his voice as in a dream; but the journey back along that
cramped tunnel, weighted by a dead woman, blinded with sand, suffocated
with heat, was in no sense a dream. It took us the best part of half
an hour to reach the open air. And, even then, we had to wait a
considerable time for the appearance of Dr. Silence. We carried her
undiscovered into the house and up to her own room.

â€œThe mummy will cause no further disturbance,â€ I heard Dr. Silence say
to our host later that evening as we prepared to drive for the night
train, â€œprovided always,â€ he added significantly, â€œthat you, and yours,
cause _it_ no disturbance.â€

It was in a dream, too, that we left.

â€œYou did not see her face, I know,â€ he said to me as we wrapped our
rugs about us in the empty compartment. And when I shook my head, quite
unable to explain the instinct that had come to me not to look, he
turned towards me, his face pale, and genuinely sad.

â€œScorched and blasted,â€ he whispered.




CASE IV

SECRET WORSHIP


Harris, the silk merchant, was in South Germany on his way home from
a business trip when the idea came to him suddenly that he would take
the mountain railway from Strassbourg and run down to revisit his old
school after an interval of something more than thirty years. And it
was to this chance impulse of the junior partner in Harris Brothers of
St. Paulâ€™s Churchyard that John Silence owed one of the most curious
cases of his whole experience, for at that very moment he happened to
be tramping these same mountains with a holiday knapsack, and from
different points of the compass the two men were actually converging
towards the same inn.

Now, deep down in the heart that for thirty years had been concerned
chiefly with the profitable buying and selling of silk, this school had
left the imprint of its peculiar influence, and, though perhaps unknown
to Harris, had strongly coloured the whole of his subsequent existence.
It belonged to the deeply religious life of a small Protestant
community (which it is unnecessary to specify), and his father had
sent him there at the age of fifteen, partly because he would learn
the German requisite for the conduct of the silk business, and partly
because the discipline was strict, and discipline was what his soul and
body needed just then more than anything else.

The life, indeed, had proved exceedingly severe, and young Harris
benefited accordingly; for though corporal punishment was unknown,
there was a system of mental and spiritual correction which somehow
made the soul stand proudly erect to receive it, while it struck at the
very root of the fault and taught the boy that his character was being
cleaned and strengthened, and that he was not merely being tortured in
a kind of personal revenge.

That was over thirty years ago, when he was a dreamy and impressionable
youth of fifteen; and now, as the train climbed slowly up the winding
mountain gorges, his mind travelled back somewhat lovingly over the
intervening period, and forgotten details rose vividly again before him
out of the shadows. The life there had been very wonderful, it seemed
to him, in that remote mountain village, protected from the tumults
of the world by the love and worship of the devout Brotherhood that
ministered to the needs of some hundred boys from every country in
Europe. Sharply the scenes came back to him. He smelt again the long
stone corridors, the hot pinewood rooms, where the sultry hours of
summer study were passed with bees droning through open windows in the
sunshine, and German characters struggling in the mind with dreams of
English lawns--and then the sudden awful cry of the master in German--

â€œHarris, stand up! You sleep!â€

And he recalled the dreadful standing motionless for an hour, book in
hand, while the knees felt like wax and the head grew heavier than a
cannon-ball.

The very smell of the cooking came back to him--the daily _Sauerkraut_,
the watery chocolate on Sundays, the flavour of the stringy meat
served twice a week at _Mittagessen_; and he smiled to think again of
the half-rations that was the punishment for speaking English. The
very odour of the milk-bowls,--the hot sweet aroma that rose from the
soaking peasant-bread at the six-oâ€™clock breakfast,--came back to him
pungently, and he saw the huge _Speisesaal_ with the hundred boys in
their school uniform, all eating sleepily in silence, gulping down
the coarse bread and scalding milk in terror of the bell that would
presently cut them short--and, at the far end where the masters sat,
he saw the narrow slit windows with the vistas of enticing field and
forest beyond.

And this, in turn, made him think of the great barn-like room on the
top floor where all slept together in wooden cots, and he heard in
memory the clamour of the cruel bell that woke them on winter mornings
at five oâ€™clock and summoned them to the stone-flagged _Waschkammer_,
where boys and masters alike, after scanty and icy washing, dressed in
complete silence.

From this his mind passed swiftly, with vivid picture-thoughts,
to other things, and with a passing shiver he remembered how
the loneliness of never being alone had eaten into him, and how
everything--work, meals, sleep, walks, leisure--was done with his
â€œdivisionâ€ of twenty other boys and under the eyes of at least two
masters. The only solitude possible was by asking for half an hourâ€™s
practice in the cell-like music rooms, and Harris smiled to himself as
he recalled the zeal of his violin studies.

Then, as the train puffed laboriously through the great pine forests
that cover these mountains with a giant carpet of velvet, he found the
pleasanter layers of memory giving up their dead, and he recalled with
admiration the kindness of the masters, whom all addressed as Brother,
and marvelled afresh at their devotion in burying themselves for years
in such a place, only to leave it, in most cases, for the still rougher
life of missionaries in the wild places of the world.

He thought once more of the still, religious atmosphere that hung
over the little forest community like a veil, barring the distressful
world; of the picturesque ceremonies at Easter, Christmas, and New
Year; of the numerous feast-days and charming little festivals. The
_Beschehr-Fest_, in particular, came back to him,--the feast of gifts
at Christmas,--when the entire community paired off and gave presents,
many of which had taken weeks to make or the savings of many days to
purchase. And then he saw the midnight ceremony in the church at New
Year, with the shining face of the _Prediger_ in the pulpit,--the
village preacher who, on the last night of the old year, saw in the
empty gallery beyond the organ loft the faces of all who were to die
in the ensuing twelve months, and who at last recognised himself among
them, and, in the very middle of his sermon, passed into a state of
rapt ecstasy and burst into a torrent of praise.

Thickly the memories crowded upon him. The picture of the small village
dreaming its unselfish life on the mountain-tops, clean, wholesome,
simple, searching vigorously for its God, and training hundreds of
boys in the grand way, rose up in his mind with all the power of an
obsession. He felt once more the old mystical enthusiasm, deeper than
the sea and more wonderful than the stars; he heard again the winds
sighing from leagues of forest over the red roofs in the moonlight; he
heard the Brothersâ€™ voices talking of the things beyond this life as
though they had actually experienced them in the body; and, as he sat
in the jolting train, a spirit of unutterable longing passed over his
seared and tired soul, stirring in the depths of him a sea of emotions
that he thought had long since frozen into immobility.

And the contrast pained him,--the idealistic dreamer then, the man of
business now,--so that a spirit of unworldly peace and beauty known
only to the soul in meditation laid its feathered finger upon his
heart, moving strangely the surface of the waters.

Harris shivered a little and looked out of the window of his empty
carriage. The train had long passed Hornberg, and far below the streams
tumbled in white foam down the limestone rocks. In front of him, dome
upon dome of wooded mountain stood against the sky. It was October,
and the air was cool and sharp, wood-smoke and damp moss exquisitely
mingled in it with the subtle odours of the pines. Overhead, between
the tips of the highest firs, he saw the first stars peeping, and the
sky was a clean, pale amethyst that seemed exactly the colour all these
memories clothed themselves with in his mind.

He leaned back in his corner and sighed. He was a heavy man, and he had
not known sentiment for years; he was a big man, and it took much to
move him, literally and figuratively; he was a man in whom the dreams
of God that haunt the soul in youth, though overlaid by the scum that
gathers in the fight for money, had not, as with the majority, utterly
died the death.

He came back into this little neglected pocket of the years, where
so much fine gold had collected and lain undisturbed, with all his
semi-spiritual emotions aquiver; and, as he watched the mountain-tops
come nearer, and smelt the forgotten odours of his boyhood, something
melted on the surface of his soul and left him sensitive to a degree he
had not known since, thirty years before, he had lived here with his
dreams, his conflicts, and his youthful suffering.

A thrill ran through him as the train stopped with a jolt at a tiny
station and he saw the name in large black lettering on the grey stone
building, and below it, the number of metres it stood above the level
of the sea.

â€œThe highest point on the line!â€ he exclaimed. â€œHow well I remember
it--Sommerau--Summer Meadow. The very next station is mine!â€

And, as the train ran downhill with brakes on and steam shut off, he
put his head out of the window and one by one saw the old familiar
landmarks in the dusk. They stared at him like dead faces in a dream.
Queer, sharp feelings, half poignant, half sweet, stirred in his heart.

â€œThereâ€™s the hot, white road we walked along so often with the two
BrÃ¼der always at our heels,â€ he thought; â€œand there, by Jove, is the
turn through the forest to â€˜_Die Galgen_,â€™ the stone gallows where they
hanged the witches in olden days!â€

He smiled a little as the train slid past.

â€œAnd thereâ€™s the copse where the Lilies of the Valley powdered the
ground in spring; and, I swear,â€--he put his head out with a sudden
impulse,--â€œif thatâ€™s not the very clearing where Calame, the French
boy, chased the swallow-tail with me, and Bruder Pagel gave us
half-rations for leaving the road without permission, and for shouting
in our mother tongues!â€ And he laughed again as the memories came back
with a rush, flooding his mind with vivid detail.

The train stopped, and he stood on the grey gravel platform like a man
in a dream. It seemed half a century since he last waited there with
corded wooden boxes, and got into the train for Strassbourg and home
after the two yearsâ€™ exile. Time dropped from him like an old garment
and he felt a boy again. Only, things looked so much smaller than his
memory of them; shrunk and dwindled they looked, and the distances
seemed on a curiously smaller scale.

He made his way across the road to the little Gasthaus, and, as he
went, faces and figures of former schoolfellows,--German, Swiss,
Italian, French, Russian,--slipped out of the shadowy woods and
silently accompanied him. They flitted by his side, raising their eyes
questioningly, sadly, to his. But their names he had forgotten. Some
of the Brothers, too, came with them, and most of these he remembered
by name--Bruder RÃ¶st, Bruder Pagel, Bruder Schliemann, and the bearded
face of the old preacher who had seen himself in the haunted gallery
of those about to die--Bruder Gysin. The dark forest lay all about
him like a sea that any moment might rush with velvet waves upon the
scene and sweep all the faces away. The air was cool and wonderfully
fragrant, but with every perfumed breath came also a pallid memory....

Yet, in spite of the underlying sadness inseparable from such an
experience, it was all very interesting, and held a pleasure peculiarly
its own, so that Harris engaged his room and ordered supper feeling
well pleased with himself, and intending to walk up to the old school
that very evening. It stood in the centre of the communityâ€™s village,
some four miles distant through the forest, and he now recollected for
the first time that this little Protestant settlement dwelt isolated
in a section of the country that was otherwise Catholic. Crucifixes
and shrines surrounded the clearing like the sentries of a beleaguring
army. Once beyond the square of the village, with its few acres of
field and orchard, the forest crowded up in solid phalanxes, and beyond
the rim of trees began the country that was ruled by the priests of
another faith. He vaguely remembered, too, that the Catholics had
showed sometimes a certain hostility towards the little Protestant
oasis that flourished so quietly and benignly in their midst. He had
quite forgotten this. How trumpery it all seemed now with his wide
experience of life and his knowledge of other countries and the great
outside world. It was like stepping back, not thirty years, but three
hundred.

There were only two others besides himself at supper. One of them, a
bearded, middle-aged man in tweeds, sat by himself at the far end,
and Harris kept out of his way because he was English. He feared he
might be in business, possibly even in the silk business, and that
he would perhaps talk on the subject. The other traveller, however,
was a Catholic priest. He was a little man who ate his salad with a
knife, yet so gently that it was almost inoffensive, and it was the
sight of â€œthe clothâ€ that recalled his memory of the old antagonism.
Harris mentioned by way of conversation the object of his sentimental
journey, and the priest looked up sharply at him with raised eyebrows
and an expression of surprise and suspicion that somehow piqued him. He
ascribed it to his difference of belief.

â€œYes,â€ went on the silk merchant, pleased to talk of what his mind was
so full, â€œand it was a curious experience for an English boy to be
dropped down into a school of a hundred foreigners. I well remember the
loneliness and intolerable Heimweh of it at first.â€ His German was very
fluent.

The priest opposite looked up from his cold veal and potato salad and
smiled. It was a nice face. He explained quietly that he did not belong
here, but was making a tour of the parishes of WÃ¼rttemberg and Baden.

â€œIt was a strict life,â€ added Harris. â€œWe English, I remember, used to
call it _GefÃ¤ngnisleben_--prison life!â€

The face of the other, for some unaccountable reason, darkened. After a
slight pause, and more by way of politeness than because he wished to
continue the subject, he said quietly--

â€œIt was a flourishing school in those days, of course. Afterwards,
I have heard----â€ He shrugged his shoulders slightly, and the odd
look--it almost seemed a look of alarm--came back into his eyes. The
sentence remained unfinished.

Something in the tone of the man seemed to his listener uncalled
for--in a sense reproachful, singular. Harris bridled in spite of
himself.

â€œIt has changed?â€ he asked. â€œI can hardly believe----â€

â€œYou have not heard, then?â€ observed the priest gently, making a
gesture as though to cross himself, yet not actually completing it.
â€œYou have not heard what happened there before it was abandoned----?â€

It was very childish, of course, and perhaps he was overtired and
overwrought in some way, but the words and manner of the little priest
seemed to him so offensive--so disproportionately offensive--that he
hardly noticed the concluding sentence. He recalled the old bitterness
and the old antagonism, and for a moment he almost lost his temper.

â€œNonsense,â€ he interrupted with a forced laugh, â€œ_Unsinn!_ You must
forgive me, sir, for contradicting you. But I was a pupil there
myself. I was at school there. There was no place like it. I cannot
believe that anything serious could have happened to--to take away its
character. The devotion of the Brothers would be difficult to equal
anywhere----â€

He broke off suddenly, realising that his voice had been raised unduly
and that the man at the far end of the table might understand German;
and at the same moment he looked up and saw that this individualâ€™s
eyes were fixed upon his face intently. They were peculiarly bright.
Also they were rather wonderful eyes, and the way they met his own
served in some way he could not understand to convey both a reproach
and a warning. The whole face of the stranger, indeed, made a vivid
impression upon him, for it was a face, he now noticed for the first
time, in whose presence one would not willingly have said or done
anything unworthy. Harris could not explain to himself how it was he
had not become conscious sooner of its presence.

But he could have bitten off his tongue for having so far forgotten
himself. The little priest lapsed into silence. Only once he said,
looking up and speaking in a low voice that was not intended to be
overheard, but that evidently _was_ overheard, â€œYou will find it
different.â€ Presently he rose and left the table with a polite bow that
included both the others.

And, after him, from the far end rose also the figure in the tweed
suit, leaving Harris by himself.

He sat on for a bit in the darkening room, sipping his coffee and
smoking his fifteen-pfennig cigar, till the girl came in to light the
oil lamps. He felt vexed with himself for his lapse from good manners,
yet hardly able to account for it. Most likely, he reflected, he
had been annoyed because the priest had unintentionally changed the
pleasant character of his dream by introducing a jarring note. Later he
must seek an opportunity to make amends. At present, however, he was
too impatient for his walk to the school, and he took his stick and hat
and passed out into the open air.

And, as he crossed before the Gasthaus, he noticed that the priest
and the man in the tweed suit were engaged already in such deep
conversation that they hardly noticed him as he passed and raised his
hat.

He started off briskly, well remembering the way, and hoping to reach
the village in time to have a word with one of the BrÃ¼der. They might
even ask him in for a cup of coffee. He felt sure of his welcome, and
the old memories were in full possession once more. The hour of return
was a matter of no consequence whatever.

It was then just after seven oâ€™clock, and the October evening was
drawing in with chill airs from the recesses of the forest. The road
plunged straight from the railway clearing into its depths, and in a
very few minutes the trees engulfed him and the clack of his boots
fell dead and echoless against the serried stems of a million firs. It
was very black; one trunk was hardly distinguishable from another. He
walked smartly, swinging his holly stick. Once or twice he passed a
peasant on his way to bed, and the guttural â€œGruss Got,â€ unheard for
so long, emphasised the passage of time, while yet making it seem as
nothing. A fresh group of pictures crowded his mind. Again the figures
of former schoolfellows flitted out of the forest and kept pace by his
side, whispering of the doings of long ago. One reverie stepped hard
upon the heels of another. Every turn in the road, every clearing of
the forest, he knew, and each in turn brought forgotten associations to
life. He enjoyed himself thoroughly.

He marched on and on. There was powdered gold in the sky till the moon
rose, and then a wind of faint silver spread silently between the
earth and stars. He saw the tips of the fir trees shimmer, and heard
them whisper as the breeze turned their needles towards the light. The
mountain air was indescribably sweet. The road shone like the foam of a
river through the gloom. White moths flitted here and there like silent
thoughts across his path, and a hundred smells greeted him from the
forest caverns across the years.

Then, when he least expected it, the trees fell away abruptly on both
sides, and he stood on the edge of the village clearing.

He walked faster. There lay the familiar outlines of the houses,
sheeted with silver; there stood the trees in the little central square
with the fountain and small green lawns; there loomed the shape of
the church next to the Gasthof der BrÃ¼dergemeinde; and just beyond,
dimly rising into the sky, he saw with a sudden thrill the mass of
the huge school building, blocked castle-like with deep shadows in
the moonlight, standing square and formidable to face him after the
silences of more than a quarter of a century.

He passed quickly down the deserted village street and stopped close
beneath its shadow, staring up at the walls that had once held
him prisoner for two years--two unbroken years of discipline and
homesickness. Memories and emotions surged through his mind; for the
most vivid sensations of his youth had focused about this spot, and
it was here he had first begun to live and learn values. Not a single
footstep broke the silence, though lights glimmered here and there
through cottage windows; but when he looked up at the high walls of
the school, draped now in shadow, he easily imagined that well-known
faces crowded to the windows to greet him--closed windows that really
reflected only moonlight and the gleam of stars.

This, then, was the old school building, standing foursquare to the
world, with its shuttered windows, its lofty, tiled roof, and the
spiked lightning-conductors pointing like black and taloned fingers
from the corners. For a long time he stood and stared. Then,
presently, he came to himself again, and realised to his joy that a
light still shone in the windows of the _Bruderstube_.

He turned from the road and passed through the iron railings; then
climbed the twelve stone steps and stood facing the black wooden door
with the heavy bars of iron, a door he had once loathed and dreaded
with the hatred and passion of an imprisoned soul, but now looked upon
tenderly with a sort of boyish delight.

Almost timorously he pulled the rope and listened with a tremor of
excitement to the clanging of the bell deep within the building. And
the long-forgotten sound brought the past before him with such a
vivid sense of reality that he positively shivered. It was like the
magic bell in the fairy-tale that rolls back the curtain of Time and
summons the figures from the shadows of the dead. He had never felt so
sentimental in his life. It was like being young again. And, at the
same time, he began to bulk rather large in his own eyes with a certain
spurious importance. He was a big man from the world of strife and
action. In this little place of peaceful dreams would he, perhaps, not
cut something of a figure?

â€œIâ€™ll try once more,â€ he thought after a long pause, seizing the iron
bell-rope, and was just about to pull it when a step sounded on the
stone passage within, and the huge door slowly swung open.

A tall man with a rather severe cast of countenance stood facing him in
silence.

â€œI must apologise--it is somewhat late,â€ he began a trifle pompously,
â€œbut the fact is I am an old pupil. I have only just arrived and really
could not restrain myself.â€ His German seemed not quite so fluent as
usual. â€œMy interest is so great. I was here in â€™70.â€

The other opened the door wider and at once bowed him in with a smile
of genuine welcome.

â€œI am Bruder Kalkmann,â€ he said quietly in a deep voice. â€œI myself was
a master here about that time. It is a great pleasure always to welcome
a former pupil.â€ He looked at him very keenly for a few seconds,
and then added, â€œI think, too, it is splendid of you to come--very
splendid.â€

â€œIt is a very great pleasure,â€ Harris replied, delighted with his
reception.

The dimly-lighted corridor with its flooring of grey stone, and the
familiar sound of a German voice echoing through it,--with the peculiar
intonation the Brothers always used in speaking,--all combined to lift
him bodily, as it were, into the dream-atmosphere of long-forgotten
days. He stepped gladly into the building and the door shut with the
familiar thunder that completed the reconstruction of the past. He
almost felt the old sense of imprisonment, of aching nostalgia, of
having lost his liberty.

Harris sighed involuntarily and turned towards his host, who returned
his smile faintly and then led the way down the corridor.

â€œThe boys have retired,â€ he explained, â€œand, as you remember, we keep
early hours here. But, at least, you will join us for a little while in
the _Bruderstube_ and enjoy a cup of coffee.â€ This was precisely what
the silk merchant had hoped, and he accepted with an alacrity that he
intended to be tempered by graciousness. â€œAnd tomorrow,â€ continued the
Bruder, â€œyou must come and spend a whole day with us. You may even find
acquaintances, for several pupils of your day have come back here as
masters.â€

For one brief second there passed into the manâ€™s eyes a look that
made the visitor start. But it vanished as quickly as it came. It was
impossible to define. Harris convinced himself it was the effect of a
shadow cast by the lamp they had just passed on the wall. He dismissed
it from his mind.

â€œYou are very kind, Iâ€™m sure,â€ he said politely. â€œIt is perhaps a
greater pleasure to me than you can imagine to see the place again.
Ah,â€--he stopped short opposite a door with the upper half of glass
and peered in--â€œsurely there is one of the music rooms where I used to
practise the violin. How it comes back to me after all these years!â€

Bruder Kalkmann stopped indulgently, smiling, to allow his guest a
momentâ€™s inspection.

â€œYou still have the boysâ€™ orchestra? I remember I used to play â€˜_zweite
Geige_â€™ in it. Bruder Schliemann conducted at the piano. Dear me, I can
see him now with his long black hair and--and----â€ He stopped abruptly.
Again the odd, dark look passed over the stern face of his companion.
For an instant it seemed curiously familiar.

â€œWe still keep up the pupilsâ€™ orchestra,â€ he said, â€œbut Bruder
Schliemann, I am sorry to say----â€ he hesitated an instant, and then
added, â€œBruder Schliemann is dead.â€

â€œIndeed, indeed,â€ said Harris quickly. â€œI am sorry to hear it.â€ He was
conscious of a faint feeling of distress, but whether it arose from
the news of his old music teacherâ€™s death, or--from something else--he
could not quite determine. He gazed down the corridor that lost itself
among shadows. In the street and village everything had seemed so
much smaller than he remembered, but here, inside the school building,
everything seemed so much bigger. The corridor was loftier and longer,
more spacious and vast, than the mental picture he had preserved. His
thoughts wandered dreamily for an instant.

He glanced up and saw the face of the Bruder watching him with a smile
of patient indulgence.

â€œYour memories possess you,â€ he observed gently, and the stern look
passed into something almost pitying.

â€œYou are right,â€ returned the man of silk, â€œthey do. This was the most
wonderful period of my whole life in a sense. At the time I hated
it----â€ He hesitated, not wishing to hurt the Brotherâ€™s feelings.

â€œAccording to English ideas it seemed strict, of course,â€ the other
said persuasively, so that he went on.

â€œ----Yes, partly that; and partly the ceaseless nostalgia, and the
solitude which came from never being really alone. In English schools
the boys enjoy peculiar freedom, you know.â€

Bruder Kalkmann, he saw, was listening intently.

â€œBut it produced one result that I have never wholly lost,â€ he
continued self-consciously, â€œand am grateful for.â€

â€œ_Ach! Wie so, denn?_â€

â€œThe constant inner pain threw me headlong into your religious life, so
that the whole force of my being seemed to project itself towards the
search for a deeper satisfaction--a real resting-place for the soul.
During my two years here I yearned for God in my boyish way as perhaps
I have never yearned for anything since. Moreover, I have never quite
lost that sense of peace and inward joy which accompanied the search. I
can never quite forget this school and the deep things it taught me.â€

He paused at the end of his long speech, and a brief silence fell
between them. He feared he had said too much, or expressed himself
clumsily in the foreign language, and when Bruder Kalkmann laid a hand
upon his shoulder, he gave a little involuntary start.

â€œSo that my memories perhaps do possess me rather strongly,â€ he added
apologetically; â€œand this long corridor, these rooms, that barred and
gloomy front door, all touch chords that--that----â€ His German failed
him and he glanced at his companion with an explanatory smile and
gesture. But the brother had removed the hand from his shoulder and was
standing with his back to him, looking down the passage.

â€œNaturally, naturally so,â€ he said hastily without turning round. â€œ_Es
ist doch selbstverstÃ¤ndlich._ We shall all understand.â€

Then he turned suddenly, and Harris saw that his face had turned most
oddly and disagreeably sinister. It may only have been the shadows
again playing their tricks with the wretched oil lamps on the wall,
for the dark expression passed instantly as they retraced their steps
down the corridor, but the Englishman somehow got the impression that
he had said something to give offence, something that was not quite to
the otherâ€™s taste. Opposite the door of the _Bruderstube_ they stopped.
Harris realised that it was late and he had possibly stayed talking too
long. He made a tentative effort to leave, but his companion would not
hear of it.

â€œYou must have a cup of coffee with us,â€ he said firmly as though he
meant it, â€œand my colleagues will be delighted to see you. Some of them
will remember you, perhaps.â€

The sound of voices came pleasantly through the door, menâ€™s voices
talking together. Bruder Kalkmann turned the handle and they entered a
room ablaze with light and full of people.

â€œAh,--but your name?â€ he whispered, bending down to catch the reply;
â€œyou have not told me your name yet.â€

â€œHarris,â€ said the Englishman quickly as they went in. He felt nervous
as he crossed the threshold, but ascribed the momentary trepidation
to the fact that he was breaking the strictest rule of the whole
establishment, which forbade a boy under severest penalties to come
near this holy of holies where the masters took their brief leisure.

â€œAh, yes, of course--Harris,â€ repeated the other as though he
remembered it â€œCome in, Herr Harris, come in, please. Your visit will
be immensely appreciated. It is really very fine, very wonderful of you
to have come in this way.â€

The door closed behind them and, in the sudden light which made his
sight swim for a moment, the exaggeration of the language escaped his
attention. He heard the voice of Bruder Kalkmann introducing him. He
spoke very loud, indeed, unnecessarily,--absurdly loud, Harris thought.

â€œBrothers,â€ he announced, â€œit is my pleasure and privilege to introduce
to you Herr Harris from England. He has just arrived to make us a
little visit, and I have already expressed to him on behalf of us all
the satisfaction we feel that he is here. He was, as you remember, a
pupil in the year â€™70.â€

It was a very formal, a very German introduction, but Harris rather
liked it. It made him feel important and he appreciated the tact that
made it almost seem as though he had been expected.

The black forms rose and bowed; Harris bowed; Kalkmann bowed. Every one
was very polite and very courtly. The room swam with moving figures;
the light dazzled him after the gloom of the corridor; there was thick
cigar smoke in the atmosphere. He took the chair that was offered to
him between two of the Brothers, and sat down, feeling vaguely that his
perceptions were not quite as keen and accurate as usual. He felt a
trifle dazed perhaps, and the spell of the past came strongly over him,
confusing the immediate present and making everything dwindle oddly to
the dimensions of long ago. He seemed to pass under the mastery of a
great mood that was a composite reproduction of all the moods of his
forgotten boyhood.

Then he pulled himself together with a sharp effort and entered into
the conversation that had begun again to buzz round him. Moreover,
he entered into it with keen pleasure, for the Brothers--there were
perhaps a dozen of them in the little room--treated him with a charm
of manner that speedily made him feel one of themselves. This, again,
was a very subtle delight to him. He felt that he had stepped out
of the greedy, vulgar, self-seeking world, the world of silk and
markets and profit-making--stepped into the cleaner atmosphere where
spiritual ideals were paramount and life was simple and devoted.
It all charmed him inexpressibly, so that he realised--yes, in a
sense--the degradation of his twenty yearsâ€™ absorption in business.
This keen atmosphere under the stars where men thought only of their
souls, and of the souls of others, was too rarefied for the world he
was now associated with. He found himself making comparisons to his
own disadvantage,--comparisons with the mystical little dreamer that
had stepped thirty years before from the stern peace of this devout
community, and the man of the world that he had since become,--and
the contrast made him shiver with a keen regret and something like
self-contempt.

He glanced round at the other faces floating towards him through
tobacco smoke--this acrid cigar smoke he remembered so well: how keen
they were, how strong, placid, touched with the nobility of great aims
and unselfish purposes. At one or two he looked particularly. He hardly
knew why. They rather fascinated him. There was something so very stern
and uncompromising about them, and something, too, oddly, subtly,
familiar, that yet just eluded him. But whenever their eyes met his own
they held undeniable welcome in them; and some held more--a kind of
perplexed admiration, he thought, something that was between esteem and
deference. This note of respect in all the faces was very flattering to
his vanity.

Coffee was served presently, made by a black-haired Brother who sat
in the corner by the piano and bore a marked resemblance to Bruder
Schliemann, the musical director of thirty years ago. Harris exchanged
bows with him when he took the cup from his white hands, which he
noticed were like the hands of a woman. He lit a cigar, offered to him
by his neighbour, with whom he was chatting delightfully, and who, in
the glare of the lighted match, reminded him sharply for a moment of
Bruder Pagel, his former room-master.

â€œ_Es ist wirklich merkwÃ¼rdig_,â€ he said, â€œhow many resemblances I see,
or imagine. It is really _very_ curious!â€

â€œYes,â€ replied the other, peering at him over his coffee cup, â€œthe
spell of the place is wonderfully strong. I can well understand that
the old faces rise before your mindâ€™s eye--almost to the exclusion of
ourselves perhaps.â€

They both laughed pleasantly. It was soothing to find his mood
understood and appreciated. And they passed on to talk of the mountain
village, its isolation, its remoteness from worldly life, its peculiar
fitness for meditation and worship, and for spiritual development--of a
certain kind.

â€œAnd your coming back in this way, Herr Harris, has pleased us all so
much,â€ joined in the Bruder on his left. â€œWe esteem you for it most
highly. We honour you for it.â€

Harris made a deprecating gesture. â€œI fear, for my part, it is only a
very selfish pleasure,â€ he said a trifle unctuously.

â€œNot all would have had the courage,â€ added the one who resembled
Bruder Pagel.

â€œYou mean,â€ said Harris, a little puzzled, â€œthe disturbing
memories----?â€

Bruder Pagel looked at him steadily, with unmistakable admiration and
respect. â€œI mean that most men hold so strongly to life, and can give
up so little for their beliefs,â€ he said gravely.

The Englishman felt slightly uncomfortable. These worthy men really
made too much of his sentimental journey. Besides, the talk was getting
a little out of his depth. He hardly followed it.

â€œThe worldly life still has _some_ charms for me,â€ he replied
smilingly, as though to indicate that sainthood was not yet quite
within his grasp.

â€œAll the more, then, must we honour you for so freely coming,â€ said the
Brother on his left; â€œso unconditionally!â€

A pause followed, and the silk merchant felt relieved when the
conversation took a more general turn, although he noted that it never
travelled very far from the subject of his visit and the wonderful
situation of the lonely village for men who wished to develop their
spiritual powers and practise the rites of a high worship. Others
joined in, complimenting him on his knowledge of the language,
making him feel utterly at his ease, yet at the same time a little
uncomfortable by the excess of their admiration. After all, it was such
a very small thing to do, this sentimental journey.

The time passed along quickly; the coffee was excellent, the cigars
soft and of the nutty flavour he loved. At length, fearing to outstay
his welcome, he rose reluctantly to take his leave. But the others
would not hear of it. It was not often a former pupil returned to visit
them in this simple, unaffected way. The night was young. If necessary
they could even find him a corner in the great _Schlafzimmer_ upstairs.
He was easily persuaded to stay a little longer. Somehow he had become
the centre of the little party. He felt pleased, flattered, honoured.

â€œAnd perhaps Bruder Schliemann will play something for us--now.â€

It was Kalkmann speaking, and Harris started visibly as he heard the
name, and saw the black-haired man by the piano turn with a smile. For
Schliemann was the name of his old music director, who was dead. Could
this be his son? They were so exactly alike.

â€œIf Bruder Meyer has not put his Amati to bed, I will accompany him,â€
said the musician suggestively, looking across at a man whom Harris had
not yet noticed, and who, he now saw, was the very image of a former
master of that name.

Meyer rose and excused himself with a little bow, and the Englishman
quickly observed that he had a peculiar gesture as though his neck had
a false join on to the body just below the collar and feared it might
break. Meyer of old had this trick of movement. He remembered how the
boys used to copy it.

He glanced sharply from face to face, feeling as though some silent,
unseen process were changing everything about him. All the faces seemed
oddly familiar. Pagel, the Brother he had been talking with, was of
course the image of Pagel, his former room-master; and Kalkmann, he now
realised for the first time, was the very twin of another master whose
name he had quite forgotten, but whom he used to dislike intensely in
the old days. And, through the smoke, peering at him from the corners
of the room, he saw that all the Brothers about him had the faces he
had known and lived with long ago--RÃ¶st, Fluheim, Meinert, Rigel, Gysin.

He stared hard, suddenly grown more alert, and everywhere saw, or
fancied he saw, strange likenesses, ghostly resemblances,--more, the
identical faces of years ago. There was something queer about it all,
something not quite right, something that made him feel uneasy. He
shook himself, mentally and actually, blowing the smoke from before his
eyes with a long breath, and as he did so he noticed to his dismay that
every one was fixedly staring. They were watching him.

This brought him to his senses. As an Englishman, and a foreigner, he
did not wish to be rude, or to do anything to make himself foolishly
conspicuous and spoil the harmony of the evening. He was a guest, and a
privileged guest at that. Besides, the music had already begun. Bruder
Schliemannâ€™s long white fingers were caressing the keys to some purpose.

He subsided into his chair and smoked with half-closed eyes that yet
saw everything.

But the shudder had established itself in his being, and, whether he
would or not, it kept repeating itself. As a town, far up some inland
river, feels the pressure of the distant sea, so he became aware that
mighty forces from somewhere beyond his ken were urging themselves
up against his soul in this smoky little room. He began to feel
exceedingly ill at ease.

And as the music filled the air his mind began to clear. Like a lifted
veil there rose up something that had hitherto obscured his vision.
The words of the priest at the railway inn flashed across his brain
unbidden: â€œYou will find it different.â€ And also, though why he
could not tell, he saw mentally the strong, rather wonderful eyes of
that other guest at the supper-table, the man who had overhead his
conversation, and had later got into earnest talk with the priest. He
took out his watch and stole a glance at it. Two hours had slipped by.
It was already eleven oâ€™clock.

Schliemann, meanwhile, utterly absorbed in his music, was playing a
solemn measure. The piano sang marvellously. The power of a great
conviction, the simplicity of great art, the vital spiritual message
of a soul that had found itself--all this, and more, were in the
chords, and yet somehow the music was what can only be described as
impure--atrociously and diabolically impure. And the piece itself,
although Harris did not recognise it as anything familiar, was surely
the music of a Mass--huge, majestic, sombre? It stalked through the
smoky room with slow power, like the passage of something that was
mighty, yet profoundly intimate, and as it went there stirred into each
and every face about him the signature of the enormous forces of which
it was the audible symbol. The countenances round him turned sinister,
but not idly, negatively sinister: they grew dark with purpose. He
suddenly recalled the face of Bruder Kalkmann in the corridor earlier
in the evening. The motives of their secret souls rose to the eyes, and
mouths, and foreheads, and hung there for all to see like the black
banners of an assembly of ill-starred and fallen creatures. Demons--was
the horrible word that flashed through his brain like a sheet of fire.

When this sudden discovery leaped out upon him, for a moment he lost
his self-control. Without waiting to think and weigh his extraordinary
impression, he did a very foolish but a very natural thing. Feeling
himself irresistibly driven by the sudden stress to some kind of
action, he sprang to his feet--and screamed! To his own utter
amazement he stood up and shrieked aloud!

But no one stirred. No one, apparently, took the slightest notice of
his absurdly wild behaviour. It was almost as if no one but himself
had heard the scream at all--as though the music had drowned it and
swallowed it up--as though after all perhaps he had not really screamed
as loudly as he imagined, or had not screamed at all.

Then, as he glanced at the motionless, dark faces before him, something
of utter cold passed into his being, touching his very soul.... All
emotion cooled suddenly, leaving him like a receding tide. He sat down
again, ashamed, mortified, angry with himself for behaving like a fool
and a boy. And the music, meanwhile, continued to issue from the white
and snake-like fingers of Bruder Schliemann, as poisoned wine might
issue from the weirdly-fashioned necks of antique phials.

And, with the rest of them, Harris drank it in.

Forcing himself to believe that he had been the victim of some kind of
illusory perception, he vigorously restrained his feelings. Then the
music presently ceased, and every one applauded and began to talk at
once, laughing, changing seats, complimenting the player, and behaving
naturally and easily as though nothing out of the way had happened.
The faces appeared normal once more. The Brothers crowded round their
visitor, and he joined in their talk and even heard himself thanking
the gifted musician.

But, at the same time, he found himself edging towards the door, nearer
and nearer, changing his chair when possible, and joining the groups
that stood closest to the way of escape.

â€œI must thank you all _tausendmal_ for my little reception and the
great pleasure--the very great honour you have done me,â€ he began in
decided tones at length, â€œbut I fear I have trespassed far too long
already on your hospitality. Moreover, I have some distance to walk to
my inn.â€

A chorus of voices greeted his words. They would not hear of his
going,--at least not without first partaking of refreshment. They
produced pumpernickel from one cupboard, and rye-bread and sausage from
another, and all began to talk again and eat. More coffee was made,
fresh cigars lighted, and Bruder Meyer took out his violin and began to
tune it softly.

â€œThere is always a bed upstairs if Herr Harris will accept it,â€ said
one.

â€œAnd it is difficult to find the way out now, for all the doors are
locked,â€ laughed another loudly.

â€œLet us take our simple pleasures as they come,â€ cried a third. â€œBruder
Harris will understand how we appreciate the honour of this last visit
of his.â€

They made a dozen excuses. They all laughed, as though the politeness
of their words was but formal, and veiled thinly--more and more
thinly--a very different meaning.

â€œAnd the hour of midnight draws near,â€ added Bruder Kalkmann with a
charming smile, but in a voice that sounded to the Englishman like the
grating of iron hinges.

Their German seemed to him more and more difficult to understand.
He noted that they called him â€œBruderâ€ too, classing him as one of
themselves.

And then suddenly he had a flash of keener perception, and
realised with a creeping of his flesh that he had all along
misinterpreted--grossly misinterpreted all they had been saying. They
had talked about the beauty of the place, its isolation and remoteness
from the world, its peculiar fitness for certain kinds of spiritual
development and worship--yet hardly, he now grasped, in the sense in
which he had taken the words. They had meant something different.
Their spiritual powers, their desire for loneliness, their passion
for worship, were not the powers, the solitude, or the worship that
_he_ meant and understood. He was playing a part in some horrible
masquerade; he was among men who cloaked their lives with religion in
order to follow their real purposes unseen of men.

What did it all mean? How had he blundered into so equivocal a
situation? Had he blundered into it at all? Had he not rather been led
into it, deliberately led? His thoughts grew dreadfully confused, and
his confidence in himself began to fade. And why, he suddenly thought
again, were they so impressed by the mere fact of his coming to revisit
his old school? What was it they so admired and wondered at in his
simple act? Why did they set such store upon his having the courage to
come, to â€œgive himself so freely,â€ â€œunconditionallyâ€ as one of them had
expressed it with such a mockery of exaggeration?

Fear stirred in his heart most horribly, and he found no answer to any
of his questionings. Only one thing he now understood quite clearly:
it was their purpose to keep him here. They did not intend that he
should go. And from this moment he realised that they were sinister,
formidable and, in some way he had yet to discover, inimical to
himself, inimical to his life. And the phrase one of them had used a
moment ago--â€œthis _last_ visit of hisâ€--rose before his eyes in letters
of flame.

Harris was not a man of action, and had never known in all the course
of his career what it meant to be in a situation of real danger. He
was not necessarily a coward, though, perhaps, a man of untried nerve.
He realised at last plainly that he was in a very awkward predicament
indeed, and that he had to deal with men who were utterly in earnest.
What their intentions were he only vaguely guessed. His mind, indeed,
was too confused for definite ratiocination, and he was only able to
follow blindly the strongest instincts that moved in him. It never
occurred to him that the Brothers might all be mad, or that he himself
might have temporarily lost his senses and be suffering under some
terrible delusion. In fact, nothing occurred to him--he realised
nothing--except that he meant to escape--and the quicker the better. A
tremendous revulsion of feeling set in and overpowered him.

Accordingly, without further protest for the moment, he ate his
pumpernickel and drank his coffee, talking meanwhile as naturally and
pleasantly as he could, and when a suitable interval had passed, he
rose to his feet and announced once more that he must now take his
leave. He spoke very quietly, but very decidedly. No one hearing him
could doubt that he meant what he said. He had got very close to the
door by this time.

â€œI regret,â€ he said, using his best German, and speaking to a hushed
room, â€œthat our pleasant evening must come to an end, but it is now
time for me to wish you all good-night.â€ And then, as no one said
anything, he added, though with a trifle less assurance, â€œAnd I thank
you all most sincerely for your hospitality.â€

â€œOn the contrary,â€ replied Kalkmann instantly, rising from his chair
and ignoring the hand the Englishman had stretched out to him, â€œit is
we who have to thank you; and we do so most gratefully and sincerely.â€

And at the same moment at least half a dozen of the Brothers took up
their position between himself and the door.

â€œYou are very good to say so,â€ Harris replied as firmly as he could
manage, noticing this movement out of the corner of his eye, â€œbut
really I had no conception that--my little chance visit could have
afforded you so much pleasure.â€ He moved another step nearer the door,
but Bruder Schliemann came across the room quickly and stood in front
of him. His attitude was uncompromising. A dark and terrible expression
had come into his face.

â€œBut it was _not_ by chance that you came, Bruder Harris,â€ he said so
that all the room could hear; â€œsurely we have not misunderstood your
presence here?â€ He raised his black eyebrows.

â€œNo, no,â€ the Englishman hastened to reply. â€œI was--I am delighted
to be here. I told you what pleasure it gave me to find myself among
you. Do not misunderstand me, I beg.â€ His voice faltered a little, and
he had difficulty in finding the words. More and more, too, he had
difficulty in understanding _their_ words.

â€œOf course,â€ interposed Bruder Kalkmann in his iron bass, â€œ_we_ have
not misunderstood. You have come back in the spirit of true and
unselfish devotion. You offer yourself freely, and we all appreciate
it. It is your willingness and nobility that have so completely won our
veneration and respect.â€ A faint murmur of applause ran round the room.
â€œWhat we all delight in--what our great Master will especially delight
in--is the value of your spontaneous and voluntary----â€

He used a word Harris did not understand. He said â€œ_Opfer_.â€ The
bewildered Englishman searched his brain for the translation, and
searched in vain. For the life of him he could not remember what it
meant. But the word, for all his inability to translate it, touched his
soul with ice. It was worse, far worse, than anything he had imagined.
He felt like a lost, helpless creature, and all power to fight sank out
of him from that moment.

â€œIt is magnificent to be such a willing----â€ added Schliemann, sidling
up to him with a dreadful leer on his face. He made use of the same
word--â€œ_Opfer_.â€

God! What could it all mean? â€œOffer himself!â€ â€œTrue spirit of
devotion!â€ â€œWilling,â€ â€œunselfish,â€ â€œmagnificent!â€ _Opfer, Opfer,
Opfer!_ What in the name of heaven did it mean, that strange,
mysterious word that struck such terror into his heart?

He made a valiant effort to keep his presence of mind and hold his
nerves steady. Turning, he saw that Kalkmannâ€™s face was a dead white.
Kalkmann! He understood that well enough. _Kalkmann_ meant â€œMan of
Chalkâ€; he knew that. But what did â€œ_Opfer_â€ mean? That was the real
key to the situation. Words poured through his disordered mind in an
endless stream--unusual, rare words he had perhaps heard but once in
his life--while â€œ_Opfer_,â€ a word in common use, entirely escaped him.
What an extraordinary mockery it all was!

Then Kalkmann, pale as death, but his face hard as iron, spoke a few
low words that he did not catch, and the Brothers standing by the walls
at once turned the lamps down so that the room became dim. In the half
light he could only just discern their faces and movements.

â€œIt is time,â€ he heard Kalkmannâ€™s remorseless voice continue just
behind him. â€œThe hour of midnight is at hand. Let us prepare. He comes!
He comes; Bruder Asmodelius comes!â€ His voice rose to a chant.

And the sound of that name, for some extraordinary reason, was
terrible--utterly terrible; so that Harris shook from head to foot as
he heard it. Its utterance filled the air like soft thunder, and a hush
came over the whole room. Forces rose all about him, transforming the
normal into the horrible, and the spirit of craven fear ran through all
his being, bringing him to the verge of collapse.

_Asmodelius! Asmodelius!_ The name was appalling. For he understood at
last to whom it referred and the meaning that lay between its great
syllables. At the same instant, too, he suddenly understood the meaning
of that unremembered word. The import of the word â€œ_Opfer_â€ flashed
upon his soul like a message of death.

He thought of making a wild effort to reach the door, but the weakness
of his trembling knees, and the row of black figures that stood
between, dissuaded him at once. He would have screamed for help, but
remembering the emptiness of the vast building, and the loneliness of
the situation, he understood that no help could come that way, and he
kept his lips closed. He stood still and did nothing. But he knew now
what was coming.

Two of the brothers approached and took him gently by the arm.

â€œBruder Asmodelius accepts you,â€ they whispered; â€œare you ready?â€

Then he found his tongue and tried to speak. â€œBut what have I to do
with this Bruder Asm--Asmo----?â€ he stammered, a desperate rush of
words crowding vainly behind the halting tongue.

The name refused to pass his lips. He could not pronounce it as they
did. He could not pronounce it at all. His sense of helplessness then
entered the acute stage, for this inability to speak the name produced
a fresh sense of quite horrible confusion in his mind, and he became
extraordinarily agitated.

â€œI came here for a friendly visit,â€ he tried to say with a great
effort, but, to his intense dismay, he heard his voice saying something
quite different, and actually making use of that very word they had all
used: â€œI came here as a willing _Opfer_,â€ he heard his own voice say,
â€œand _I am quite ready_.â€

He was lost beyond all recall now! Not alone his mind, but the very
muscles of his body had passed out of control. He felt that he was
hovering on the confines of a phantom or demon-world,--a world in which
the name they had spoken constituted the Master-name, the word of
ultimate power.

What followed he heard and saw as in a nightmare.

â€œIn the half light that veils all truth, let us prepare to worship and
adore,â€ chanted Schliemann, who had preceded him to the end of the room.

â€œIn the mists that protect our faces before the Black Throne, let us
make ready the willing victim,â€ echoed Kalkmann in his great bass.

They raised their faces, listening expectantly, as a roaring sound,
like the passing of mighty projectiles, filled the air, far, far away,
very wonderful, very forbidding. The walls of the room trembled.

â€œHe comes! He comes! He comes!â€ chanted the Brothers in chorus.

The sound of roaring died away, and an atmosphere of still and utter
cold established itself over all. Then Kalkmann, dark and unutterably
stern, turned in the dim light and faced the rest.

â€œAsmodelius, our _Hauptbruder_, is about us,â€ he cried in a voice that
even while it shook was yet a voice of iron; â€œAsmodelius is about us.
Make ready.â€

There followed a pause in which no one stirred or spoke. A tall Brother
approached the Englishman; but Kalkmann held up his hand.

â€œLet the eyes remain uncovered,â€ he said, â€œin honour of so freely
giving himself.â€ And to his horror Harris then realised for the first
time that his hands were already fastened to his sides.

The Brother retreated again silently, and in the pause that followed
all the figures about him dropped to their knees, leaving him standing
alone, and as they dropped, in voices hushed with mingled reverence and
awe, they cried softly, odiously, appallingly, the name of the Being
whom they momentarily expected to appear.

Then, at the end of the room, where the windows seemed to have
disappeared so that he saw the stars, there rose into view far up
against the night sky, grand and terrible, the outline of a man. A
kind of grey glory enveloped it so that it resembled a steel-cased
statue, immense, imposing, horrific in its distant splendour; while,
at the same time, the face was so spiritually mighty, yet so proudly,
so austerely sad, that Harris felt as he stared, that the sight was
more than his eyes could meet, and that in another moment the power
of vision would fail him altogether, and he must sink into utter
nothingness.

So remote and inaccessible hung this figure that it was impossible to
gauge anything as to its size, yet at the same time so strangely close,
that when the grey radiance from its mightily broken visage, august and
mournful, beat down upon his soul, pulsing like some dark star with the
powers of spiritual evil, he felt almost as though he were looking into
a face no farther removed from him in space than the face of any one of
the Brothers who stood by his side.

And then the room filled and trembled with sounds that Harris
understood full well were the failing voices of others who had preceded
him in a long series down the years. There came first a plain, sharp
cry, as of a man in the last anguish, choking for his breath, and
yet, with the very final expiration of it, breathing the name of the
Worship--of the dark Being who rejoiced to hear it. The cries of the
strangled; the short, running gasp of the suffocated; and the smothered
gurgling of the tightened throat, all these, and more, echoed back
and forth between the walls, the very walls in which he now stood a
prisoner, a sacrificial victim. The cries, too, not alone of the broken
bodies, but--far worse--of beaten, broken souls. And as the ghastly
chorus rose and fell, there came also the faces of the lost and unhappy
creatures to whom they belonged, and, against that curtain of pale grey
light, he saw float past him in the air, an array of white and piteous
human countenances that seemed to beckon and gibber at him as though he
were already one of themselves.

Slowly, too, as the voices rose, and the pallid crew sailed past, that
giant form of grey descended from the sky and approached the room that
contained the worshippers and their prisoner. Hands rose and sank about
him in the darkness, and he felt that he was being draped in other
garments than his own; a circlet of ice seemed to run about his head,
while round the waist, enclosing the fastened arms, he felt a girdle
tightly drawn. At last, about his very throat, there ran a soft and
silken touch which, better than if there had been full light, and a
mirror held to his face, he understood to be the cord of sacrifice--and
of death.

At this moment the Brothers, still prostrate upon the floor, began
again their mournful, yet impassioned chanting, and as they did so a
strange thing happened. For, apparently without moving or altering its
position, the huge Figure seemed, at once and suddenly, to be inside
the room, almost beside him, and to fill the space around him to the
exclusion of all else.

He was now beyond all ordinary sensations of fear, only a drab feeling
as of death--the death of the soul--stirred in his heart. His thoughts
no longer even beat vainly for escape. The end was near, and he knew
it.

The dreadfully chanting voices rose about him in a wave: â€œWe worship!
We adore! We offer!â€ The sounds filled his ears and hammered, almost
meaningless, upon his brain.

Then the majestic grey face turned slowly downwards upon him, and his
very soul passed outwards and seemed to become absorbed in the sea
of those anguished eyes. At the same moment a dozen hands forced him
to his knees, and in the air before him he saw the arm of Kalkmann
upraised, and felt the pressure about his throat grow strong.

It was in this awful moment, when he had given up all hope, and the
help of gods or men seemed beyond question, that a strange thing
happened. For before his fading and terrified vision, there slid, as
in a dream of light,--yet without apparent rhyme or reason--wholly
unbidden and unexplained,--the face of that other man at the supper
table of the railway inn. And the sight, even mentally, of that strong,
wholesome, vigorous English face, inspired him suddenly with a new
courage.

It was but a flash of fading vision before he sank into a dark and
terrible death, yet, in some inexplicable way, the sight of that face
stirred in him unconquerable hope and the certainty of deliverance. It
was a face of power, a face, he now realised, of simple goodness such
as might have been seen by men of old on the shores of Galilee; a face,
by heaven, that could conquer even the devils of outer space.

And, in his despair and abandonment, he called upon it, and called with
no uncertain accents. He found his voice in this overwhelming moment
to some purpose; though the words he actually used, and whether they
were in German or English, he could never remember. Their effect,
nevertheless, was instantaneous. The Brothers understood, and that grey
Figure of evil understood.

For a second the confusion was terrific. There came a great shattering
sound. It seemed that the very earth trembled. But all Harris
remembered afterwards was that voices rose about him in the clamour of
terrified alarm--

â€œA man of power is among us! A man of God!â€

The vast sound was repeated--the rushing through space as of huge
projectiles--and he sank to the floor of the room, unconscious. The
entire scene had vanished, vanished like smoke over the roof of a
cottage when the wind blows.

And, by his side, sat down a slight, un-German figure,--the figure of
the stranger at the inn,--the man who had the â€œrather wonderful eyes.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

When Harris came to himself he felt cold. He was lying under the open
sky, and the cool air of field and forest was blowing upon his face.
He sat up and looked about him. The memory of the late scene was
still horribly in his mind, but no vestige of it remained. No walls
or ceiling enclosed him; he was no longer in a room at all. There
were no lamps turned low, no cigar smoke, no black forms of sinister
worshippers, no tremendous grey Figure hovering beyond the windows.

Open space was about him, and he was lying on a pile of bricks and
mortar, his clothes soaked with dew, and the kind stars shining
brightly overhead. He was lying, bruised and shaken, among the
heaped-up dÃ©bris of a ruined building.

He stood up and stared about him. There, in the shadowy distance, lay
the surrounding forest, and here, close at hand, stood the outline of
the village buildings. But, underfoot, beyond question, lay nothing
but the broken heaps of stones that betokened a building long since
crumbled to dust. Then he saw that the stones were blackened, and
that great wooden beams, half burnt, half rotten, made lines through
the general dÃ©bris. He stood, then, among the ruins of a burnt and
shattered building, the weeds and nettles proving conclusively that it
had lain thus for many years.

The moon had already set behind the encircling forest, but the stars
that spangled the heavens threw enough light to enable him to make
quite sure of what he saw. Harris, the silk merchant, stood among these
broken and burnt stones and shivered.

Then he suddenly became aware that out of the gloom a figure had risen
and stood beside him. Peering at him, he thought he recognised the face
of the stranger at the railway inn.

â€œAre _you_ real?â€ he asked in a voice he hardly recognised as his own.

â€œMore than real--Iâ€™m friendly,â€ replied the stranger; â€œI followed you
up here from the inn.â€

Harris stood and stared for several minutes without adding anything.
His teeth chattered. The least sound made him start; but the simple
words in his own language, and the tone in which they were uttered,
comforted him inconceivably.

â€œYouâ€™re English too, thank God,â€ he said inconsequently. â€œThese German
devils----â€ He broke off and put a hand to his eyes. â€œBut whatâ€™s
become of them all--and the room--and--and----â€ The hand travelled
down to his throat and moved nervously round his neck. He drew a long,
long breath of relief. â€œDid I dream everything--everything?â€ he said
distractedly.

He stared wildly about him, and the stranger moved forward and took his
arm. â€œCome,â€ he said soothingly, yet with a trace of command in the
voice, â€œwe will move away from here. The high-road, or even the woods
will be more to your taste, for we are standing now on one of the most
haunted--and most terribly haunted--spots of the whole world.â€

He guided his companionâ€™s stumbling footsteps over the broken masonry
until they reached the path, the nettles stinging their hands, and
Harris feeling his way like a man in a dream. Passing through the
twisted iron railing they reached the path, and thence made their way
to the road, shining white in the night. Once safely out of the ruins,
Harris collected himself and turned to look back.

â€œBut, how is it possible?â€ he exclaimed, his voice still shaking.
â€œHow can it be possible? When I came in here I saw the building in
the moonlight. They opened the door. I saw the figures and heard the
voices and touched, yes touched their very hands, and saw their damned
black faces, saw them far more plainly than I see you now.â€ He was
deeply bewildered. The glamour was still upon his eyes with a degree
of reality stronger than the reality even of normal life. â€œWas I so
utterly deluded?â€

Then suddenly the words of the stranger, which he had only half heard
or understood, returned to him.

â€œHaunted?â€ he asked, looking hard at him; â€œhaunted, did you say?â€ He
paused in the roadway and stared into the darkness where the building
of the old school had first appeared to him. But the stranger hurried
him forward.

â€œWe shall talk more safely farther on,â€ he said. â€œI followed you from
the inn the moment I realised where you had gone. When I found you it
was eleven oâ€™clock----â€

â€œEleven oâ€™clock,â€ said Harris, remembering with a shudder.

â€œ----I saw you drop. I watched over you till you recovered
consciousness of your own accord, and now--now I am here to guide you
safely back to the inn. I have broken the spell--the glamour----â€

â€œI owe you a great deal, sir,â€ interrupted Harris again, beginning
to understand something of the strangerâ€™s kindness, â€œbut I donâ€™t
understand it all. I feel dazed and shaken.â€ His teeth still chattered,
and spells of violent shivering passed over him from head to foot. He
found that he was clinging to the otherâ€™s arm. In this way they passed
beyond the deserted and crumbling village and gained the high-road that
led homewards through the forest.

â€œThat school building has long been in ruins,â€ said the man at his side
presently; â€œit was burnt down by order of the Elders of the community
at least ten years ago. The village has been uninhabited ever since.
But the simulacra of certain ghastly events that took place under
that roof in past days still continue. And the â€˜shellsâ€™ of the chief
participants still enact there the dreadful deeds that led to its final
destruction, and to the desertion of the whole settlement. They were
devil-worshippers!â€

Harris listened with beads of perspiration on his forehead that did
not come alone from their leisurely pace through the cool night.
Although he had seen this man but once before in his life, and had
never before exchanged so much as a word with him, he felt a degree of
confidence and a subtle sense of safety and well-being in his presence
that were the most healing influences he could possibly have wished
after the experience he had been through. For all that, he still felt
as if he were walking in a dream, and though he heard every word that
fell from his companionâ€™s lips, it was only the next day that the full
import of all he said became fully clear to him. The presence of this
quiet stranger, the man with the wonderful eyes which he felt now,
rather than saw, applied a soothing anodyne to his shattered spirit
that healed him through and through. And this healing influence,
distilled from the dark figure at his side, satisfied his first
imperative need, so that he almost forgot to realise how strange and
opportune it was that the man should be there at all.

It somehow never occurred to him to ask his name, or to feel any undue
wonder that one passing tourist should take so much trouble on behalf
of another. He just walked by his side, listening to his quiet words,
and allowing himself to enjoy the very wonderful experience after his
recent ordeal, of being helped, strengthened, blessed. Only once,
remembering vaguely something of his reading of years ago, he turned to
the man beside him, after some more than usually remarkable words, and
heard himself, almost involuntarily it seemed, putting the question:
â€œThen are you a Rosicrucian, sir, perhaps?â€ But the stranger had
ignored the words, or possibly not heard them, for he continued with
his talk as though unconscious of any interruption, and Harris became
aware that another somewhat unusual picture had taken possession of his
mind, as they walked there side by side through the cool reaches of the
forest, and that he had found his imagination suddenly charged with the
childhood memory of Jacob wrestling with an angel,--wrestling all night
with a being of superior quality whose strength eventually became his
own.

â€œIt was your abrupt conversation with the priest at supper that first
put me upon the track of this remarkable occurrence,â€ he heard the
manâ€™s quiet voice beside him in the darkness, â€œand it was from him
I learned after you left the story of the devil-worship that became
secretly established in the heart of this simple and devout little
community.â€

â€œDevil-worship! Here----!â€ Harris stammered, aghast.

â€œYes--here;--conducted secretly for years by a group of Brothers before
unexplained disappearances in the neighbourhood led to its discovery.
For where could they have found a safer place in the whole wide world
for their ghastly traffic and perverted powers than here, in the very
precincts--under cover of the very shadow of saintliness and holy
living?â€

â€œAwful, awful!â€ whispered the silk merchant, â€œand when I tell you the
words they used to me----â€

â€œI know it all,â€ the stranger said quietly. â€œI saw and heard
everything. My plan first was to wait till the end and then to take
steps for their destruction, but in the interest of your personal
safety,â€--he spoke with the utmost gravity and conviction,--â€œin the
interest of the safety of your soul, I made my presence known when I
did, and before the conclusion had been reached----â€

â€œMy safety! The danger, then, was real. They were alive and----â€ Words
failed him. He stopped in the road and turned towards his companion,
the shining of whose eyes he could just make out in the gloom.

â€œIt was a concourse of the shells of violent men, spiritually-developed
but evil men, seeking after death--the death of the body--to prolong
their vile and unnatural existence. And had they accomplished their
object you, in turn, at the death of your body, would have passed into
their power and helped to swell their dreadful purposes.â€

Harris made no reply. He was trying hard to concentrate his mind upon
the sweet and common things of life. He even thought of silk and St.
Paulâ€™s Churchyard and the faces of his partners in business.

â€œFor you came all prepared to be caught,â€ he heard the otherâ€™s
voice like some one talking to him from a distance; â€œyour deeply
introspective mood had already reconstructed the past so vividly, so
intensely, that you were _en rapport_ at once with any forces of those
days that chanced still to be lingering. And they swept you up all
unresistingly.â€

Harris tightened his hold upon the strangerâ€™s arm as he heard. At the
moment he had room for one emotion only. It did not seem to him odd
that this stranger should have such intimate knowledge of his mind.

â€œIt is, alas, chiefly the evil emotions that are able to leave their
photographs upon surrounding scenes and objects,â€ the other added, â€œand
who ever heard of a place haunted by a noble deed, or of beautiful and
lovely ghosts revisiting the glimpses of the moon? It is unfortunate.
But the wicked passions of menâ€™s hearts alone seem strong enough to
leave pictures that persist; the good are ever too lukewarm.â€

The stranger sighed as he spoke. But Harris, exhausted and shaken as
he was to the very core, paced by his side, only half listening. He
moved as in a dream still. It was very wonderful to him, this walk
home under the stars in the early hours of the October morning, the
peaceful forest all about them, mist rising here and there over the
small clearings, and the sound of water from a hundred little invisible
streams filling in the pauses of the talk. In after life he always
looked back to it as something magical and impossible, something that
had seemed too beautiful, too curiously beautiful, to have been quite
true. And, though at the time he heard and understood but a quarter of
what the stranger said, it came back to him afterwards, staying with
him till the end of his days, and always with a curious, haunting sense
of unreality, as though he had enjoyed a wonderful dream of which he
could recall only faint and exquisite portions.

But the horror of the earlier experience was effectually dispelled; and
when they reached the railway inn, somewhere about three oâ€™clock in
the morning, Harris shook the strangerâ€™s hand gratefully, effusively,
meeting the look of those rather wonderful eyes with a full heart, and
went up to his room, thinking in a hazy, dream-like way of the words
with which the stranger had brought their conversation to an end as
they left the confines of the forest--

â€œAnd if thought and emotion can persist in this way so long after
the brain that sent them forth has crumbled into dust, how vitally
important it must be to control their very birth in the heart, and
guard them with the keenest possible restraint.â€

But Harris, the silk merchant, slept better than might have been
expected, and with a soundness that carried him half-way through the
day. And when he came downstairs and learned that the stranger had
already taken his departure, he realised with keen regret that he had
never once thought of asking his name.

â€œYes, he signed in the visitorsâ€™ book,â€ said the girl in reply to his
question.

And he turned over the blotted pages and found there, the last entry,
in a very delicate and individual handwriting--

â€œ_John Silence_, London.â€




CASE V

THE CAMP OF THE DOG


I

Islands of all shapes and sizes troop northward from Stockholm by the
hundred, and the little steamer that threads their intricate mazes in
summer leaves the traveller in a somewhat bewildered state as regards
the points of the compass when it reaches the end of its journey at
Waxholm. But it is only after Waxholm that the true islands begin, so
to speak, to run wild, and start up the coast on their tangled course
of a hundred miles of deserted loveliness, and it was in the very heart
of this delightful confusion that we pitched our tents for a summer
holiday. A veritable wilderness of islands lay about us: from the mere
round button of a rock that bore a single fir, to the mountainous
stretch of a square mile, densely wooded, and bounded by precipitous
cliffs; so close together often that a strip of water ran between no
wider than a country lane, or, again, so far that an expanse stretched
like the open sea for miles.

Although the larger islands boasted farms and fishing stations, the
majority were uninhabited. Carpeted with moss and heather, their
coast-lines showed a series of ravines and clefts and little sandy
bays, with a growth of splendid pine-woods that came down to the
waterâ€™s edge and led the eye through unknown depths of shadow and
mystery into the very heart of primitive forest.

The particular islands to which we had camping rights by virtue
of paying a nominal sum to a Stockholm merchant lay together in a
picturesque group far beyond the reach of the steamer, one being a mere
reef with a fringe of fairy-like birches, and two others, cliff-bound
monsters rising with wooded heads out of the sea. The fourth, which we
selected because it enclosed a little lagoon suitable for anchorage,
bathing, night-lines, and what-not, shall have what description is
necessary as the story proceeds; but, so far as paying rent was
concerned, we might equally well have pitched our tents on any one of a
hundred others that clustered about us as thickly as a swarm of bees.

It was in the blaze of an evening in July, the air clear as crystal,
the sea a cobalt blue, when we left the steamer on the borders of
civilisation and sailed away with maps, compasses, and provisions for
the little group of dots in the SkÃ¤rgÃ¥rd that were to be our home for
the next two months. The dinghy and my Canadian canoe trailed behind
us, with tents and dunnage carefully piled aboard, and when the point
of cliff intervened to hide the steamer and the Waxholm hotel we
realised for the first time that the horror of trains and houses was
far behind us, the fever of men and cities, the weariness of streets
and confined spaces. The wilderness opened up on all sides into endless
blue reaches, and the map and compasses were so frequently called
into requisition that we went astray more often than not and progress
was enchantingly slow. It took us, for instance, two whole days to
find our crescent-shaped home, and the camps we made on the way were
so fascinating that we left them with difficulty and regret, for each
island seemed more desirable than the one before it, and over all lay
the spell of haunting peace, remoteness from the turmoil of the world,
and the freedom of open and desolate spaces.

And so many of these spots of world-beauty have I sought out and
dwelt in, that in my mind remains only a composite memory of their
faces, a true map of heaven, as it were, from which this particular
one stands forth with unusual sharpness because of the strange things
that happened there, and also, I think, because anything in which John
Silence played a part has a habit of fixing itself in the mind with a
living and lasting quality of vividness.

For the moment, however, Dr. Silence was not of the party. Some private
case in the interior of Hungary claimed his attention, and it was not
till later--the 15th of August, to be exact--that I had arranged to
meet him in Berlin and then return to London together for our harvest
of winter work. All the members of our party, however, were known to
him more or less well, and on this third day as we sailed through the
narrow opening into the lagoon and saw the circular ridge of trees in a
gold and crimson sunset before us, his last words to me when we parted
in London for some unaccountable reason came back very sharply to my
memory, and recalled the curious impression of prophecy with which I
had first heard them:

â€œEnjoy your holiday and store up all the force you can,â€ he had said as
the train slipped out of Victoria; â€œand we will meet in Berlin on the
15th--unless you should send for me sooner.â€

And now suddenly the words returned to me so clearly that it seemed
I almost heard his voice in my ear: â€œUnless you should send for me
sooner;â€ and returned, moreover, with a significance I was wholly at a
loss to understand that touched somewhere in the depths of my mind a
vague sense of apprehension that they had all along been intended in
the nature of a prophecy.

In the lagoon, then, the wind failed us this July evening, as was only
natural behind the shelter of the belt of woods, and we took to the
oars, all breathless with the beauty of this first sight of our island
home, yet all talking in somewhat hushed voices of the best place to
land, the depth of water, the safest place to anchor, to put up the
tents in, the most sheltered spot for the camp-fires, and a dozen
things of importance that crop up when a home in the wilderness has
actually to be made.

And during this busy sunset hour of unloading before the dark, the
souls of my companions adopted the trick of presenting themselves very
vividly anew before my mind, and introducing themselves afresh.

In reality, I suppose, our party was in no sense singular. In the
conventional life at home they certainly seemed ordinary enough,
but suddenly, as we passed through these gates of the wilderness,
I saw them more sharply than before, with characters stripped of
the atmosphere of men and cities. A complete change of setting
often furnishes a startlingly new view of people hitherto held for
well-known; they present another facet of their personalities. I seemed
to see my own party almost as new people--people I had not known
properly hitherto, people who would drop all disguises and henceforth
reveal themselves as they really were. And each one seemed to say: â€œNow
you will see me as I am. You will see me here in this primitive life
of the wilderness without clothes. All my masks and veils I have left
behind in the abodes of men. So, look out for surprises!â€

The Reverend Timothy Maloney helped me to put up the tents, long
practice making the process easy, and while he drove in pegs and
tightened ropes, his coat off, his flannel collar flying open without
a tie, it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that he was cut out
for the life of a pioneer rather than the church. He was fifty years
of age, muscular, blue-eyed and hearty, and he took his share of the
work, and more, without shirking. The way he handled the axe in cutting
down saplings for the tent-poles was a delight to see, and his eye in
judging the level was unfailing.

Bullied as a young man into a lucrative family living, he had in turn
bullied his mind into some semblance of orthodox beliefs, doing the
honours of the little country church with an energy that made one think
of a coal-heaver tending china; and it was only in the past few years
that he had resigned the living and taken instead to cramming young men
for their examinations. This suited him better. It enabled him, too, to
indulge his passion for spells of â€œwild life,â€ and to spend the summer
months of most years under canvas in one part of the world or another
where he could take his young men with him and combine â€œreadingâ€ with
open air.

His wife usually accompanied him, and there was no doubt she enjoyed
the trips, for she possessed, though in less degree, the same joy of
the wilderness that was his own distinguishing characteristic. The only
difference was that while he regarded it as the real life, she regarded
it as an interlude. While he camped out with his heart and mind, she
played at camping out with her clothes and body. None the less, she
made a splendid companion, and to watch her busy cooking dinner over
the fire we had built among the stones was to understand that her heart
was in the business for the moment and that she was happy even with the
detail.

Mrs. Maloney at home, knitting in the sun and believing that the world
was made in six days, was one woman; but Mrs. Maloney, standing with
bare arms over the smoke of a wood fire under the pine trees, was
another; and Peter Sangree, the Canadian pupil, with his pale skin,
and his loose, though not ungainly figure, stood beside her in very
unfavourable contrast as he scraped potatoes and sliced bacon with
slender white fingers that seemed better suited to hold a pen than a
knife. She ordered him about like a slave, and he obeyed, too, with
willing pleasure, for in spite of his general appearance of debility he
was as happy to be in camp as any of them.

But more than any other member of the party, Joan Maloney, the
daughter, was the one who seemed a natural and genuine part of the
landscape, who belonged to it all just in the same way that the trees
and the moss and the grey rocks running out into the water belonged to
it. For she was obviously in her right and natural setting, a creature
of the wilds, a gipsy in her own home.

To any one with a discerning eye this would have been more or less
apparent, but to me, who had known her during all the twenty-two
years of her life and was familiar with the ins and outs of her
primitive, utterly un-modern type, it was strikingly clear. To see
her there made it impossible to imagine her again in civilisation. I
lost all recollection of how she looked in a town. The memory somehow
evaporated. This slim creature before me, flitting to and fro with the
grace of the woodland life, swift, supple, adroit, on her knees blowing
the fire, or stirring the frying-pan through a veil of smoke, suddenly
seemed the only way I had ever really seen her. Here she was at home;
in London she became some one concealed by clothes, an artificial doll
overdressed and moving by clockwork, only a portion of her alive. Here
she was alive all over.

I forget altogether how she was dressed, just as I forget how any
particular tree was dressed, or how the markings ran on any one of the
boulders that lay about the Camp. She looked just as wild and natural
and untamed as everything else that went to make up the scene, and more
than that I cannot say.

Pretty, she was decidedly not. She was thin, skinny, dark-haired, and
possessed of great physical strength in the form of endurance. She had,
too, something of the force and vigorous purpose of a man, tempestuous
sometimes and wild to passionate, frightening her mother, and puzzling
her easy-going father with her storms of waywardness, while at the same
time she stirred his admiration by her violence. A pagan of the pagans
she was besides, and with some haunting suggestion of old-world pagan
beauty about her dark face and eyes. Altogether an odd and difficult
character, but with a generosity and high courage that made her very
lovable.

In town life she always seemed to me to feel cramped, bored, a devil
in a cage, in her eyes a hunted expression as though any moment she
dreaded to be caught. But up in these spacious solitudes all this
disappeared. Away from the limitations that plagued and stung her, she
would show at her best, and as I watched her moving about the Camp
I repeatedly found myself thinking of a wild creature that had just
obtained its freedom and was trying its muscles.

Peter Sangree, of course, at once went down before her. But she was so
obviously beyond his reach, and besides so well able to take care of
herself, that I think her parents gave the matter but little thought,
and he himself worshipped at a respectful distance, keeping admirable
control of his passion in all respects save one; for at his age the
eyes are difficult to master, and the yearning, almost the devouring,
expression often visible in them was probably there unknown even to
himself. He, better than any one else, understood that he had fallen in
love with something most hard of attainment, something that drew him
to the very edge of life, and almost beyond it. It, no doubt, was a
secret and terrible joy to him, this passionate worship from afar; only
I think he suffered more than any one guessed, and that his want of
vitality was due in large measure to the constant stream of unsatisfied
yearning that poured for ever from his soul and body. Moreover, it
seemed to me, who now saw them for the first time together, that there
was an unnamable something--an elusive quality of some kind--that
marked them as belonging to the same world, and that although the girl
ignored him she was secretly, and perhaps unknown to herself, drawn by
some attribute very deep in her own nature to some quality equally deep
in his.

This, then, was the party when we first settled down into our two
monthsâ€™ camp on the island in the Baltic Sea. Other figures flitted
from time to time across the scene, and sometimes one reading man,
sometimes another, came to join us and spend his four hours a day in
the clergymanâ€™s tent, but they came for short periods only, and they
went without leaving much trace in my memory, and certainly they played
no important part in what subsequently happened.

The weather favoured us that night, so that by sunset the tents were
up, the boats unloaded, a store of wood collected and chopped into
lengths, and the candle-lanterns hung round ready for lighting on the
trees. Sangree, too, had picked deep mattresses of balsam boughs for
the womenâ€™s beds, and had cleared little paths of brushwood from their
tents to the central fireplace. All was prepared for bad weather. It
was a cosy supper and a well-cooked one that we sat down to and ate
under the stars, and, according to the clergyman, the only meal fit to
eat we had seen since we left London a week before.

The deep stillness, after that roar of steamers, trains, and tourists,
held something that thrilled, for as we lay round the fire there was
no sound but the faint sighing of the pines and the soft lapping of
the waves along the shore and against the sides of the boat in the
lagoon. The ghostly outline of her white sails was just visible
through the trees, idly rocking to and fro in her calm anchorage,
her sheets flapping gently against the mast. Beyond lay the dim blue
shapes of other islands floating in the night, and from all the great
spaces about us came the murmur of the sea and the soft breathing of
great woods. The odours of the wilderness--smells of wind and earth,
of trees and water, clean, vigorous, and mighty--were the true odours
of a virgin world unspoilt by men, more penetrating and more subtly
intoxicating than any other perfume in the whole world. Oh!--and
dangerously strong, too, no doubt, for some natures!

â€œAhhh!â€ breathed out the clergyman after supper, with an indescribable
gesture of satisfaction and relief. â€œHere there is freedom, and room
for body and mind to turn in. Here one can work and rest and play. Here
one can be alive and absorb something of the earth-forces that never
get within touching-distance in the cities. By George, I shall make a
permanent camp here and come when it is time to die!â€

The good man was merely giving vent to his delight at being under
canvas. He said the same thing every year, and he said it often. But it
more or less expressed the superficial feelings of us all. And when, a
little later, he turned to compliment his wife on the fried potatoes,
and discovered that she was snoring, with her back against a tree,
he grunted with content at the sight and put a ground-sheet over her
feet, as if it were the most natural thing in the world for her to fall
asleep after dinner, and then moved back to his own corner, smoking his
pipe with great satisfaction.

And I, smoking mine too, lay and fought against the most delicious
sleep imaginable, while my eyes wandered from the fire to the stars
peeping through the branches, and then back again to the group about
me. The Rev. Timothy soon let his pipe go out, and succumbed as his
wife had done, for he had worked hard and eaten well. Sangree, also
smoking, leaned against a tree with his gaze fixed on the girl, a
depth of yearning in his face that he could not hide, and that really
distressed me for him. And Joan herself, with wide staring eyes, alert,
full of the new forces of the place, evidently keyed up by the magic of
finding herself among all the things her soul recognised as â€œhome,â€ sat
rigid by the fire, her thoughts roaming through the spaces, the blood
stirring about her heart. She was as unconscious of the Canadianâ€™s gaze
as she was that her parents both slept. She looked to me more like a
tree, or something that had grown out of the island, than a living
girl of the century; and when I spoke across to her in a whisper and
suggested a tour of investigation, she started and looked up at me as
though she heard a voice in her dreams.

Sangree leaped up and joined us, and without waking the others we three
went over the ridge of the island and made our way down to the shore
behind. The water lay like a lake before us still coloured by the
sunset. The air was keen and scented, wafting the smell of the wooded
islands that hung about us in the darkening air. Very small waves
tumbled softly on the sand. The sea was sown with stars, and everywhere
breathed and pulsed the beauty of the northern summer night. I confess
I speedily lost consciousness of the human presences beside me, and I
have little doubt Joan did too. Only Sangree felt otherwise, I suppose
for presently we heard him sighing; and I can well imagine that he
absorbed the whole wonder and passion of the scene into his aching
heart, to swell the pain there that was more searching even than the
pain at the sight of such matchless and incomprehensible beauty.

The splash of a fish jumping broke the spell.

â€œI wish we had the canoe now,â€ remarked Joan; â€œwe could paddle out to
the other islands.â€

â€œOf course,â€ I said; â€œwait here and Iâ€™ll go across for it,â€ and was
turning to feel my way back through the darkness when she stopped me in
a voice that meant what it said.

â€œNo; Mr. Sangree will get it. We will wait here and cooee to guide him.â€

The Canadian was off in a moment, for she had only to hint of her
wishes and he obeyed.

â€œKeep out from shore in case of rocks,â€ I cried out as he went, â€œand
turn to the right out of the lagoon. Thatâ€™s the shortest way round by
the map.â€

My voice travelled across the still waters and woke echoes in the
distant islands that came back to us like people calling out of space.
It was only thirty or forty yards over the ridge and down the other
side to the lagoon where the boats lay, but it was a good mile to coast
round the shore in the dark to where we stood and waited. We heard him
stumbling away among the boulders, and then the sounds suddenly ceased
as he topped the ridge and went down past the fire on the other side.

â€œI didnâ€™t want to be left alone with himâ€ the girl said presently in a
low voice. â€œIâ€™m always afraid heâ€™s going to say or do something----â€
She hesitated a moment, looking quickly over her shoulder towards the
ridge where he had just disappeared--â€œsomething that might lead to
unpleasantness.â€

She stopped abruptly.

â€œ_You_ frightened, Joan!â€ I exclaimed, with genuine surprise. â€œThis is
a new light on your wicked character. I thought the human being who
could frighten you did not exist.â€ Then I suddenly realised she was
talking seriously--looking to me for help of some kind--and at once I
dropped the teasing attitude.

â€œHeâ€™s very far gone, I think, Joan,â€ I added gravely. â€œYou must be kind
to him, whatever else you may feel. Heâ€™s exceedingly fond of you.â€

â€œI know, but I canâ€™t help it,â€ she whispered, lest her voice should
carry in the stillness; â€œthereâ€™s something about him that--that makes
me feel creepy and half afraid.â€

â€œBut, poor man, itâ€™s not his fault if he is delicate and sometimes
looks like death,â€ I laughed gently, by way of defending what I felt to
be a very innocent member of my sex.

â€œOh, but itâ€™s not that I mean,â€ she answered quickly; â€œitâ€™s something
I feel about him, something in his soul, something he hardly knows
himself, but that may come out if we are much together. It draws me, I
feel, tremendously. It stirs what is wild in me--deep down--oh, very
deep down,--yet at the same time makes me feel afraid.â€

â€œI suppose his thoughts are always playing about you,â€ I said, â€œbut
heâ€™s nice-minded and----â€

â€œYes, yes,â€ she interrupted impatiently, â€œI can trust myself absolutely
with him. Heâ€™s gentle and singularly pure-minded. But thereâ€™s something
else that----â€ She stopped again sharply to listen. Then she came up
close beside me in the darkness, whispering--

â€œYou know, Mr. Hubbard, sometimes my intuitions warn me a little too
strongly to be ignored. Oh yes, you neednâ€™t tell me again that itâ€™s
difficult to distinguish between fancy and intuition. I know all that.
But I also know that thereâ€™s something deep down in that manâ€™s soul
that calls to something deep down in mine. And at present it frightens
me. Because I cannot make out what it is; and I know, I _know_, heâ€™ll
do something some day that--that will shake my life to the very
bottom.â€ She laughed a little at the strangeness of her own description.

I turned to look at her more closely, but the darkness was too great to
show her face. There was an intensity, almost of suppressed passion, in
her voice that took me completely by surprise.

â€œNonsense, Joan,â€ I said, a little severely; â€œyou know him well. Heâ€™s
been with your father for months now.â€

â€œBut that was in London; and up here itâ€™s different--I mean, I feel
that it may be different. Life in a place like this blows away the
restraints of the artificial life at home. I know, oh, I know what Iâ€™m
saying. I feel all untied in a place like this; the rigidity of oneâ€™s
nature begins to melt and flow. Surely _you_ must understand what I
mean!â€

â€œOf course I understand,â€ I replied, yet not wishing to encourage her
in her present line of thought, â€œand itâ€™s a grand experience--for a
short time. But youâ€™re overtired to-night, Joan, like the rest of us.
A few days in this air will set you above all fears of the kind you
mention.â€

Then, after a momentâ€™s silence, I added, feeling I should estrange her
confidence altogether if I blundered any more and treated her like a
child--

â€œI think, perhaps, the true explanation is that you pity him for loving
you, and at the same time you feel the repulsion of the healthy,
vigorous animal for what is weak and timid. If he came up boldly and
took you by the throat and shouted that he would force you to love
him--well, then you would feel no fear at all. You would know exactly
how to deal with him. Isnâ€™t it, perhaps, something of that kind?â€

The girl made no reply, and when I took her hand I felt that it
trembled a little and was cold.

â€œItâ€™s not his love that Iâ€™m afraid of,â€ she said hurriedly, for at this
moment we heard the dip of a paddle in the water, â€œitâ€™s something in
his very soul that terrifies me in a way I have never been terrified
before,--yet fascinates me. In town I was hardly conscious of his
presence. But the moment we got away from civilisation, it began to
come. He seems so--so _real_ up here. I dread being alone with him. It
makes me feel that something must burst and tear its way out--that he
would do something--or I should do something--I donâ€™t know exactly what
I mean, probably,--but that I should let myself go and scream----â€

â€œJoan!â€

â€œDonâ€™t be alarmed,â€ she laughed shortly; â€œI shanâ€™t do anything silly,
but I wanted to tell you my feelings in case I needed your help. When
I have intuitions as strong as this they are never wrong, only I donâ€™t
know yet what it means exactly.â€

â€œYou must hold out for the month, at any rate,â€ I said in as
matter-of-fact a voice as I could manage, for her manner had somehow
changed my surprise to a subtle sense of alarm. â€œSangree only stays the
month, you know. And, anyhow, you are such an odd creature yourself
that you should feel generously towards other odd creatures,â€ I ended
lamely, with a forced laugh.

She gave my hand a sudden pressure. â€œIâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve told you at any
rate,â€ she said quickly under her breath, for the canoe was now gliding
up silently like a ghost to our feet, â€œand Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here too,â€
she added as we moved down towards the water to meet it.

I made Sangree change into the bows and got into the steering seat
myself, putting the girl between us so that I could watch them both by
keeping their outlines against the sea and stars. For the intuitions
of certain folk--women and children usually, I confess--I have always
felt a great respect that has more often than not been justified by
experience; and now the curious emotion stirred in me by the girlâ€™s
words remained somewhat vividly in my consciousness. I explained it in
some measure by the fact that the girl, tired out by the fatigue of
many daysâ€™ travel, had suffered a vigorous reaction of some kind from
the strong, desolate scenery, and further, perhaps, that she had been
treated to my own experience of seeing the members of the party in a
new light--the Canadian, being partly a stranger, more vividly than the
rest of us. But, at the same time, I felt it was quite possible that
she had sensed some subtle link between his personality and her own,
some quality that she had hitherto ignored and that the routine of town
life had kept buried out of sight. The only thing that seemed difficult
to explain was the fear she had spoken of, and this I hoped the
wholesome effects of camp-life and exercise would sweep away naturally
in the course of time.

We made the tour of the island without speaking. It was all too
beautiful for speech. The trees crowded down to the shore to hear us
pass. We saw their fine dark heads, bowed low with splendid dignity
to watch us, forgetting for a moment that the stars were caught in
the needled network of their hair. Against the sky in the west, where
still lingered the sunset gold, we saw the wild toss of the horizon,
shaggy with forest and cliff, gripping the heart like the motive in
a symphony, and sending the sense of beauty all a-shiver through the
mind--all these surrounding islands standing above the water like low
clouds, and like them seeming to post along silently into the engulfing
night. We heard the musical drip-drip of the paddle, and the little
wash of our waves on the shore, and then suddenly we found ourselves at
the opening of the lagoon again, having made the complete circuit of
our home.

The Reverend Timothy had awakened from sleep and was singing to
himself; and the sound of his voice as we glided down the fifty yards
of enclosed water was pleasant to hear and undeniably wholesome. We saw
the glow of the fire up among the trees on the ridge, and his shadow
moving about as he threw on more wood.

â€œThere you are!â€ he called aloud. â€œGood again! Been setting the
night-lines, eh? Capital! And your motherâ€™s still fast asleep, Joan.â€

His cheery laugh floated across the water; he had not been in the least
disturbed by our absence, for old campers are not easily alarmed.

â€œNow, remember,â€ he went on, after we had told our little tale of
travel by the fire, and Mrs. Maloney had asked for the fourth time
exactly where her tent was and whether the door faced east or south,
â€œevery one takes their turn at cooking breakfast, and one of the men is
always out at sunrise to catch it first. Hubbard, Iâ€™ll toss you which
you do in the morning and which I do!â€ He lost the toss. â€œThen Iâ€™ll
catch it,â€ I said, laughing at his discomfiture, for I knew he loathed
stirring porridge. â€œAnd mind you donâ€™t burn it as you did every blessed
time last year on the Volga,â€ I added by way of reminder.

Mrs. Maloneyâ€™s fifth interruption about the door of her tent, and her
further pointed observation that it was past nine oâ€™clock, set us
lighting lanterns and putting the fire out for safety.

But before we separated for the night the clergyman had a time-honoured
little ritual of his own to go through that no one had the heart to
deny him. He always did this. It was a relic of his pulpit habits.
He glanced briefly from one to the other of us, his face grave and
earnest, his hands lifted to the stars and his eyes all closed and
puckered up beneath a momentary frown. Then he offered up a short,
almost inaudible prayer, thanking Heaven for our safe arrival, begging
for good weather, no illness or accidents, plenty of fish, and strong
sailing winds.

And then, unexpectedly--no one knew why exactly--he ended up with an
abrupt request that nothing from the kingdom of darkness should be
allowed to afflict our peace, and no evil thing come near to disturb us
in the night-time.

And while he uttered these last surprising words, so strangely unlike
his usual ending, it chanced that I looked up and let my eyes wander
round the group assembled about the dying fire. And it certainly seemed
to me that Sangreeâ€™s face underwent a sudden and visible alteration.
He was staring at Joan, and as he stared the change ran over it like a
shadow and was gone. I started in spite of myself, for something oddly
concentrated, potent, collected, had come into the expression usually
so scattered and feeble. But it was all swift as a passing meteor, and
when I looked a second time his face was normal and he was looking
among the trees.

And Joan, luckily, had not observed him, her head being bowed and her
eyes tightly closed while her father prayed.

â€œThe girl has a vivid imagination indeed,â€ I thought, half laughing,
as I lit the lanterns, â€œif her thoughts can put a glamour upon mine in
this way;â€ and yet somehow, when we said good-night, I took occasion to
give her a few vigorous words of encouragement, and went to her tent
to make sure I could find it quickly in the night in case anything
happened. In her quick way the girl understood and thanked me, and
the last thing I heard as I moved off to the menâ€™s quarters was Mrs.
Maloney crying that there were beetles in her tent, and Joanâ€™s laughter
as she went to help her turn them out.

Half an hour later the island was silent as the grave, but for the
mournful voices of the wind as it sighed up from the sea. Like white
sentries stood the three tents of the men on one side of the ridge,
and on the other side, half hidden by some birches, whose leaves just
shivered as the breeze caught them, the womenâ€™s tents, patches of
ghostly grey, gathered more closely together for mutual shelter and
protection. Something like fifty yards of broken ground, grey rock,
moss and lichen, lay between, and over all lay the curtain of the night
and the great whispering winds from the forests of Scandinavia.

And the very last thing, just before floating away on that mighty
wave that carries one so softly off into the deeps of forgetfulness,
I again heard the voice of John Silence as the train moved out of
Victoria Station; and by some subtle connection that met me on the very
threshold of consciousness there rose in my mind simultaneously the
memory of the girlâ€™s half-given confidence, and of her distress. As by
some wizardry of approaching dreams they seemed in that instant to be
related; but before I could analyse the why and the wherefore, both
sank away out of sight again, and I was off beyond recall.

â€œUnless you should send for me sooner.â€


II

Whether Mrs. Maloneyâ€™s tent door opened south or east I think she
never discovered, for it is quite certain she always slept with the
flap tightly fastened; I only know that my own little â€œfive by seven,
all silkâ€ faced due east, because next morning the sun, pouring in as
only the wilderness sun knows how to pour, woke me early, and a moment
later, with a short run over soft moss and a flying dive from the
granite ledge, I was swimming in the most sparkling water imaginable.

It was barely four oâ€™clock, and the sun came down a long vista of blue
islands that led out to the open sea and Finland. Nearer by rose the
wooded domes of our own property, still capped and wreathed with smoky
trails of fast-melting mist, and looking as fresh as though it was the
morning of Mrs. Maloneyâ€™s Sixth Day and they had just issued, clean and
brilliant, from the hands of the great Architect.

In the open spaces the ground was drenched with dew, and from the sea a
cool salt wind stole in among the trees and set the branches trembling
in an atmosphere of shimmering silver. The tents shone white where the
sun caught them in patches. Below lay the lagoon, still dreaming of
the summer night; in the open the fish were jumping busily, sending
musical ripples towards the shore; and in the air hung the magic of
dawn--silent, incommunicable.

I lit the fire, so that an hour later the clergyman should find good
ashes to stir his porridge over, and then set forth upon an examination
of the island, but hardly had I gone a dozen yards when I saw a figure
standing a little in front of me where the sunlight fell in a pool
among the trees.

It was Joan. She had already been up an hour, she told me, and had
bathed before the last stars had left the sky. I saw at once that the
new spirit of this solitary region had entered into her, banishing the
fears of the night, for her face was like the face of a happy denizen
of the wilderness, and her eyes stainless and shining. Her feet were
bare, and drops of dew she had shaken from the branches hung in her
loose-flying hair. Obviously she had come into her own.

â€œIâ€™ve been all over the island,â€ she announced laughingly, â€œand there
are two things wanting.â€

â€œYouâ€™re a good judge, Joan. What are they?â€

â€œThereâ€™s no animal life, and thereâ€™s no--water.â€

â€œThey go together,â€ I said. â€œAnimals donâ€™t bother with a rock like this
unless thereâ€™s a spring on it.â€

And as she led me from place to place, happy and excited, leaping
adroitly from rock to rock, I was glad to note that my first
impressions were correct. She made no reference to our conversation of
the night before. The new spirit had driven out the old. There was no
room in her heart for fear or anxiety, and Nature had everything her
own way.

The island, we found, was some three-quarters of a mile from point
to point, built in a circle, or wide horseshoe, with an opening of
twenty feet at the mouth of the lagoon. Pine-trees grew thickly all
over, but here and there were patches of silver birch, scrub oak, and
considerable colonies of wild raspberry and gooseberry bushes. The two
ends of the horseshoe formed bare slabs of smooth granite running into
the sea and forming dangerous reefs just below the surface, but the
rest of the island rose in a forty-foot ridge and sloped down steeply
to the sea on either side, being nowhere more than a hundred yards wide.

The outer shore-line was much indented with numberless coves and bays
and sandy beaches, with here and there caves and precipitous little
cliffs against which the sea broke in spray and thunder. But the inner
shore, the shore of the lagoon, was low and regular, and so well
protected by the wall of trees along the ridge that no storm could ever
send more than a passing ripple along its sandy marges. Eternal shelter
reigned there.

On one of the other islands, a few hundred yards away--for the rest of
the party slept late this first morning, and we took to the canoe--we
discovered a spring of fresh water untainted by the brackish flavour of
the Baltic, and having thus solved the most important problem of the
Camp, we next proceeded to deal with the second--fish. And in half an
hour we reeled in and turned homewards, for we had no means of storage,
and to clean more fish than may be stored or eaten in a day is no wise
occupation for experienced campers.

And as we landed towards six oâ€™clock we heard the clergyman singing as
usual and saw his wife and Sangree shaking out their blankets in the
sun, and dressed in a fashion that finally dispelled all memories of
streets and civilisation.

â€œThe Little People lit the fire for me,â€ cried Maloney, looking natural
and at home in his ancient flannel suit and breaking off in the middle
of his singing, â€œso Iâ€™ve got the porridge going--and this time itâ€™s
_not_ burnt.â€

We reported the discovery of water and held up the fish.

â€œGood! Good again!â€ he cried. â€œWeâ€™ll have the first decent breakfast
weâ€™ve had this year. Sangreeâ€™ll clean â€™em in no time, and the Boâ€™sunâ€™s
Mate----â€

â€œWill fry them to a turn,â€ laughed the voice of Mrs. Maloney, appearing
on the scene in a tight blue jersey and sandals, and catching up the
frying-pan. Her husband always called her the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate in Camp,
because it was her duty, among others, to pipe all hands to meals.

â€œAnd as for you, Joan,â€ went on the happy man, â€œyou look like the
spirit of the island, with moss in your hair and wind in your eyes,
and sun and stars mixed in your face.â€ He looked at her with delighted
admiration. â€œHere, Sangree, take these twelve, thereâ€™s a good fellow,
theyâ€™re the biggest; and weâ€™ll have â€™em in butter in less time than you
can say Baltic island!â€

I watched the Canadian as he slowly moved off to the cleaning pail.
His eyes were drinking in the girlâ€™s beauty, and a wave of passionate,
almost feverish, joy passed over his face, expressive of the ecstasy of
true worship more than anything else. Perhaps he was thinking that he
still had three weeks to come with that vision always before his eyes;
perhaps he was thinking of his dreams in the night. I cannot say. But
I noticed the curious mingling of yearning and happiness in his eyes,
and the strength of the impression touched my curiosity. Something in
his face held my gaze for a second, something to do with its intensity.
That so timid, so gentle a personality should conceal so virile a
passion almost seemed to require explanation.

But the impression was momentary, for that first breakfast in Camp
permitted no divided attentions, and I dare swear that the porridge,
the tea, the Swedish â€œflatbread,â€ and the fried fish flavoured with
points of frizzled bacon, were better than any meal eaten elsewhere
that day in the whole world.

The first clear day in a new camp is always a furiously busy one, and
we soon dropped into the routine upon which in large measure the real
comfort of every one depends. About the cooking-fire, greatly improved
with stones from the shore, we built a high stockade consisting of
upright poles thickly twined with branches, the roof lined with moss
and lichen and weighted with rocks, and round the interior we made low
wooden seats so that we could lie round the fire even in rain and eat
our meals in peace. Paths, too, outlined themselves from tent to tent,
from the bathing places and the landing stage, and a fair division of
the island was decided upon between the quarters of the men and the
women. Wood was stacked, awkward trees and boulders removed, hammocks
slung, and tents strengthened. In a word, Camp was established, and
duties were assigned and accepted as though we expected to live on
this Baltic island for years to come and the smallest detail of the
Community life was important.

Moreover, as the Camp came into being, this sense of a community
developed, proving that we were a definite whole, and not merely
separate human beings living for a while in tents upon a desert island.
Each fell willingly into the routine. Sangree, as by natural selection,
took upon himself the cleaning of the fish and the cutting of the wood
into lengths sufficient for a dayâ€™s use. And he did it well. The pan
of water was never without a fish, cleaned and scaled, ready to fry
for whoever was hungry; the nightly fire never died down for lack of
material to throw on without going farther afield to search.

And Timothy, once reverend, caught the fish and chopped down the
trees. He also assumed responsibility for the condition of the boat,
and did it so thoroughly that nothing in the little cutter was ever
found wanting. And when, for any reason, his presence was in demand,
the first place to look for him was--in the boat, and there, too, he
was usually found, tinkering away with sheets, sails, or rudder and
singing as he tinkered.

Nor was the â€œreadingâ€ neglected; for most mornings there came a sound
of droning voices from the white tent by the raspberry bushes, which
signified that Sangree, the tutor, and whatever other man chanced to be
in the party at the time, were hard at it with history or the classics.

And while Mrs. Maloney, also by natural selection, took charge of
the larder and the kitchen, the mending and general supervision of
the rough comforts, she also made herself peculiarly mistress of the
megaphone which summoned to meals and carried her voice easily from one
end of the island to the other; and in her hours of leisure she daubed
the surrounding scenery on to a sketching block with all the honesty
and devotion of her determined but unreceptive soul.

Joan, meanwhile, Joan, elusive creature of the wilds, became I know
not exactly what. She did plenty of work in the Camp, yet seemed to
have no very precise duties. She was everywhere and anywhere. Sometimes
she slept in her tent, sometimes under the stars with a blanket. She
knew every inch of the island and kept turning up in places where she
was least expected--for ever wandering about, reading her books in
sheltered corners, making little fires on sunless days to â€œworship by
to the gods,â€ as she put it, ever finding new pools to dive and bathe
in, and swimming day and night in the warm and waveless lagoon like a
fish in a huge tank. She went bare-legged and bare-footed, with her
hair down and her skirts caught up to the knees, and if ever a human
being turned into a jolly savage within the compass of a single week,
Joan Maloney was certainly that human being. She ran wild.

So completely, too, was she possessed by the strong spirit of the
place that the little human fear she had yielded to so strangely on
our arrival seemed to have been utterly dispossessed. As I hoped and
expected, she made no reference to our conversation of the first
evening. Sangree bothered her with no special attentions, and after
all they were very little together. His behaviour was perfect in that
respect, and I, for my part, hardly gave the matter another thought.
Joan was ever a prey to vivid fancies of one kind or another, and this
was one of them. Mercifully for the happiness of all concerned, it had
melted away before the spirit of busy, active life and deep content
that reigned over the island. Every one was intensely alive, and peace
was upon all.

       *       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile the effect of the camp-life began to tell. Always a searching
test of character, its results, sooner or later, are infallible, for
it acts upon the soul as swiftly and surely as the hypo bath upon the
negative of a photograph. A readjustment of the personal forces takes
place quickly; some parts of the personality go to sleep, others wake
up: but the first sweeping change that the primitive life brings about
is that the artificial portions of the character shed themselves one
after another like dead skins. Attitudes and poses that seemed genuine
in the city, drop away. The mind, like the body, grows quickly hard,
simple, uncomplex. And in a camp as primitive and close to nature as
ours was, these effects became speedily visible.

Some folk, of course, who talk glibly about the simple life when it
is safely out of reach, betray themselves in camp by for ever peering
about for the artificial excitements of civilisation which they miss.
Some get bored at once; some grow slovenly; some reveal the animal in
most unexpected fashion; and some, the select few, find themselves in
very short order and are happy.

And, in our little party, we could flatter ourselves that we all
belonged to the last category, so far as the general effect was
concerned. Only there were certain other changes as well, varying with
each individual, and all interesting to note.

It was only after the first week or two that these changes became
marked, although this is the proper place, I think, to speak of them.
For, having myself no other duty than to enjoy a well-earned holiday,
I used to load my canoe with blankets and provisions and journey forth
on exploration trips among the islands of several days together; and
it was on my return from the first of these--when I rediscovered the
party, so to speak--that these changes first presented themselves
vividly to me, and in one particular instance produced a rather curious
impression.

In a word, then, while every one had grown wilder, naturally wilder,
Sangree, it seemed to me, had grown much wilder, and what I can only
call unnaturally wilder. He made me think of a savage.

To begin with, he had changed immensely in mere physical appearance,
and the full brown cheeks, the brighter eyes of absolute health, and
the general air of vigour and robustness that had come to replace his
customary lassitude and timidity, had worked such an improvement that I
hardly knew him for the same man. His voice, too, was deeper and his
manner bespoke for the first time a greater measure of confidence in
himself. He now had some claims to be called nice-looking, or at least
to a certain air of virility that would not lessen his value in the
eyes of the opposite sex.

All this, of course, was natural enough, and most welcome. But,
altogether apart from this physical change, which no doubt had also
been going forward in the rest of us, there was a subtle note in his
personality that came to me with a degree of surprise that almost
amounted to shock.

And two things--as he came down to welcome me and pull up the
canoe--leaped up in my mind unbidden, as though connected in some way
I could not at the moment divine--first, the curious judgment formed
of him by Joan; and secondly, that fugitive expression I had caught in
his face while Maloney was offering up his strange prayer for special
protection from Heaven.

The delicacy of manner and feature--to call it by no milder term--which
had always been a distinguishing characteristic of the man, had been
replaced by something far more vigorous and decided, that yet utterly
eluded analysis. The change which impressed me so oddly was not easy
to name. The others--singing Maloney, the bustling Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate, and
Joan, that fascinating half-breed of undine and salamander--all showed
the effects of a life so close to nature; but in their case the change
was perfectly natural and what was to be expected, whereas with Peter
Sangree, the Canadian, it was something unusual and unexpected.

It is impossible to explain how he managed gradually to convey to my
mind the impression that something in him had turned savage, yet this,
more or less, is the impression that he did convey. It was not that
he seemed really less civilised, or that his character had undergone
any definite alteration, but rather that something in him, hitherto
dormant, had awakened to life. Some quality, latent till now--so
far, at least, as we were concerned, who, after all, knew him but
slightly--had stirred into activity and risen to the surface of his
being.

And while, for the moment, this seemed as far as I could get, it was
but natural that my mind should continue the intuitive process and
acknowledge that John Silence, owing to his peculiar faculties, and the
girl, owing to her singularly receptive temperament, might each in a
different way have divined this latent quality in his soul, and feared
its manifestation later.

On looking back to this painful adventure, too, it now seems equally
natural that the same process, carried to its logical conclusion,
should have wakened some deep instinct in me that, wholly without
direction from my will, set itself sharply and persistently upon the
watch from that very moment. Thenceforward the personality of Sangree
was never far from my thoughts, and I was for ever analysing and
searching for the explanation that took so long in coming.

â€œI declare, Hubbard, youâ€™re tanned like an aboriginal, and you look
like one, too,â€ laughed Maloney.

â€œAnd I can return the compliment,â€ was my reply, as we all gathered
round a brew of tea to exchange news and compare notes.

And later, at supper, it amused me to observe that the distinguished
tutor, once clergyman, did not eat his food quite as â€œnicelyâ€ as he did
at home--he devoured it; that Mrs. Maloney ate more, and, to say the
least, with less delay, than was her custom in the select atmosphere
of her English dining-room; and that while Joan attacked her tin
plateful with genuine avidity, Sangree, the Canadian, bit and gnawed
at his, laughing and talking and complimenting the cook all the while,
and making me think with secret amusement of a starved animal at its
first meal. While, from their remarks about myself, I judged that I had
changed and grown wild as much as the rest of them.

In this and in a hundred other little ways the change showed, ways
difficult to define in detail, but all proving--not the coarsening
effect of leading the primitive life, but, let us say, the more direct
and unvarnished methods that became prevalent. For all day long we
were in the bath of the elements--wind, water, sun--and just as the
body became insensible to cold and shed unnecessary clothing, the mind
grew straightforward and shed many of the disguises required by the
conventions of civilisation.

And in each, according to temperament and character, there stirred the
life-instincts that were natural, untamed, and, in a sense--savage.


III

So it came about that I stayed with our island party, putting off
my second exploring trip from day to day, and I think that this
far-fetched instinct to watch Sangree was really the cause of my
postponement.

For another ten days the life of the Camp pursued its even and
delightful way, blessed by perfect summer weather, a good harvest
of fish, fine winds for sailing, and calm, starry nights. Maloneyâ€™s
selfish prayer had been favourably received. Nothing came to disturb
or perplex. There was not even the prowling of night animals to vex
the rest of Mrs. Maloney; for in previous camps it had often been her
peculiar affliction that she heard the porcupines scratching against
the canvas, or the squirrels dropping fir-cones in the early morning
with a sound of miniature thunder upon the roof of her tent. But on
this island there was not even a squirrel or a mouse. I think two toads
and a small and harmless snake were the only living creatures that had
been discovered during the whole of the first fortnight. And these two
toads in all probability were not two toads, but one toad.

Then, suddenly, came the terror that changed the whole aspect of the
place--the devastating terror.

It came, at first, gently, but from the very start it made me realise
the unpleasant loneliness of our situation, our remote isolation in
this wilderness of sea and rock, and how the islands in this tideless
Baltic ocean lay about us like the advance guard of a vast besieging
army. Its entry, as I say, was gentle, hardly noticeable, in fact,
to most of us: singularly undramatic it certainly was. But, then, in
actual life this is often the way the dreadful climaxes move upon us,
leaving the heart undisturbed almost to the last minute, and then
overwhelming it with a sudden rush of horror. For it was the custom at
breakfast to listen patiently while each in turn related the trivial
adventures of the night--how they slept, whether the wind shook their
tent, whether the spider on the ridge pole had moved, whether they had
heard the toad, and so forth--and on this particular morning Joan, in
the middle of a little pause, made a truly novel announcement:

â€œIn the night I heard the howling of a dog,â€ she said, and then flushed
up to the roots of her hair when we burst out laughing. For the idea
of there being a dog on this forsaken island that was only able to
support a snake and two toads was distinctly ludicrous, and I remember
Maloney, half-way through his burnt porridge, capping the announcement
by declaring that he had heard a â€œBaltic turtleâ€ in the lagoon, and his
wifeâ€™s expression of frantic alarm before the laughter undeceived her.

But the next morning Joan repeated the story with additional and
convincing detail.

â€œSounds of whining and growling woke me,â€ she said, â€œand I distinctly
heard sniffing under my tent, and the scratching of paws.â€

â€œOh, Timothy! Can it be a porcupine?â€ exclaimed the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate with
distress, forgetting that Sweden was not Canada.

But the girlâ€™s voice had sounded to me in quite another key, and
looking up I saw that her father and Sangree were staring at her hard.
They, too, understood that she was in earnest, and had been struck by
the serious note in her voice.

â€œRubbish, Joan! You are always dreaming something or other wild,â€ her
father said a little impatiently.

â€œThereâ€™s not an animal of any size on the whole island,â€ added Sangree
with a puzzled expression. He never took his eyes from her face.

â€œBut thereâ€™s nothing to prevent one swimming over,â€ I put in briskly,
for somehow a sense of uneasiness that was not pleasant had woven
itself into the talk and pauses. â€œA deer, for instance, might easily
land in the night and take a look round----â€

â€œOr a bear!â€ gasped the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate, with a look so portentous that
we all welcomed the laugh.

But Joan did not laugh. Instead, she sprang up and called to us to
follow.

â€œThere,â€ she said, pointing to the ground by her tent on the side
farthest from her motherâ€™s; â€œthere are the marks close to my head. You
can see for yourselves.â€

We saw plainly. The moss and lichen--for earth there was hardly
any--had been scratched up by paws. An animal about the size of a large
dog it must have been, to judge by the marks. We stood and stared in a
row.

â€œClose to my head,â€ repeated the girl, looking round at us. Her face,
I noticed, was very pale, and her lip seemed to quiver for an instant.
Then she gave a sudden gulp--and burst into a flood of tears.

The whole thing had come about in the brief space of a few minutes, and
with a curious sense of inevitableness, moreover, as though it had all
been carefully planned from all time and nothing could have stopped it.
It had all been rehearsed before--had actually happened before, as the
strange feeling sometimes has it; it seemed like the opening movement
in some ominous drama, and that I knew exactly what would happen next.
Something of great moment was impending.

For this sinister sensation of coming disaster made itself felt from
the very beginning, and an atmosphere of gloom and dismay pervaded the
entire Camp from that moment forward.

I drew Sangree to one side and moved away, while Maloney took the
distressed girl into her tent, and his wife followed them, energetic
and greatly flustered.

For thus, in undramatic fashion, it was that the terror I have
spoken of first attempted the invasion of our Camp, and, trivial and
unimportant though it seemed, every little detail of this opening scene
is photographed upon my mind with merciless accuracy and precision.
It happened exactly as described. This was exactly the language used.
I see it written before me in black and white. I see, too, the faces
of all concerned with the sudden ugly signature of alarm where before
had been peace. The terror had stretched out, so to speak, a first
tentative feeler towards us and had touched the hearts of each with a
horrid directness. And from this moment the Camp changed.

Sangree in particular was visibly upset. He could not bear to see the
girl distressed, and to hear her actually cry was almost more than he
could stand. The feeling that he had no right to protect her hurt him
keenly, and I could see that he was itching to do something to help,
and liked him for it. His expression said plainly that he would tear in
a thousand pieces anything that dared to injure a hair of her head.

We lit our pipes and strolled over in silence to the menâ€™s quarters,
and it was his odd Canadian expression â€œGee whiz!â€ that drew my
attention to a further discovery.

â€œThe bruteâ€™s been scratching round my tent too,â€ he cried, as he
pointed to similar marks by the door and I stooped down to examine
them. We both stared in amazement for several minutes without speaking.

â€œOnly I sleep like the dead,â€ he added, straightening up again, â€œand so
heard nothing, I suppose.â€

We traced the paw-marks from the mouth of his tent in a direct line
across to the girlâ€™s, but nowhere else about the Camp was there a
sign of the strange visitor. The deer, dog, or whatever it was that
had twice favoured us with a visit in the night, had confined its
attentions to these two tents. And, after all, there was really
nothing out of the way about these visits of an unknown animal, for
although our own island was destitute of life, we were in the heart
of a wilderness, and the mainland and larger islands must be swarming
with all kinds of four-footed creatures, and no very prolonged swimming
was necessary to reach us. In any other country it would not have
caused a momentâ€™s interest--interest of the kind we felt, that is.
In our Canadian camps the bears were for ever grunting about among
the provision bags at night, porcupines scratching unceasingly, and
chipmunks scuttling over everything.

â€œMy daughter is overtired, and thatâ€™s the truth of it,â€ explained
Maloney presently when he rejoined us and had examined in turn the
other paw-marks. â€œSheâ€™s been overdoing it lately, and camp-life, you
know, always means a great excitement to her. Itâ€™s natural enough. If
we take no notice sheâ€™ll be all right.â€ He paused to borrow my tobacco
pouch and fill his pipe, and the blundering way he filled it and
spilled the precious weed on the ground visibly belied the calm of his
easy language. â€œYou might take her out for a bit of fishing, Hubbard,
like a good chap; sheâ€™s hardly up to the long day in the cutter. Show
her some of the other islands in your canoe, perhaps. Eh?â€

And by lunch-time the cloud had passed away as suddenly, and as
suspiciously, as it had come.

But in the canoe, on our way home, having till then purposely ignored
the subject uppermost in our minds, she suddenly spoke to me in a way
that again touched the note of sinister alarm--the note that kept on
sounding and sounding until finally John Silence came with his great
vibrating presence and relieved it; yes, and even after he came, too,
for a while.

â€œIâ€™m ashamed to ask it,â€ she said abruptly, as she steered me home,
her sleeves rolled up, her hair blowing in the wind, â€œand ashamed of
my silly tears too, because I really canâ€™t make out what caused them;
but, Mr. Hubbard, I want you to promise me not to go off for your long
expeditions--just yet. I beg it of you.â€ She was so in earnest that
she forgot the canoe, and the wind caught it sideways and made us roll
dangerously. â€œI have tried hard not to ask this,â€ she added, bringing
the canoe round again, â€œbut I simply canâ€™t help myself.â€

It was a good deal to ask, and I suppose my hesitation was plain; for
she went on before I could reply, and her beseeching expression and
intensity of manner impressed me very forcibly.

â€œFor another two weeks only----â€

â€œMr. Sangree leaves in a fortnight,â€ I said, seeing at once what she
was driving at, but wondering if it was best to encourage her or not.

â€œIf I knew you were to be on the island till then,â€ she said, her face
alternately pale and blushing, and her voice trembling a little, â€œI
should feel so much happier.â€

I looked at her steadily, waiting for her to finish.

â€œAnd safer,â€ she added almost in a whisper; â€œespecially--at night, I
mean.â€

â€œSafer, Joan?â€ I repeated, thinking I had never seen her eyes so soft
and tender. She nodded her head, keeping her gaze fixed on my face.

It was really difficult to refuse, whatever my thoughts and judgment
may have been, and somehow I understood that she spoke with good
reason, though for the life of me I could not have put it into words.

â€œHappier--and safer,â€ she said gravely, the canoe giving a dangerous
lurch as she leaned forward in her seat to catch my answer. Perhaps,
after all, the wisest way was to grant her request and make light of
it, easing her anxiety without too much encouraging its cause.

â€œAll right, Joan, you queer creature; I promise,â€ and the instant look
of relief in her face, and the smile that came back like sunlight to
her eyes, made me feel that, unknown to myself and the world, I was
capable of considerable sacrifice after all.

â€œBut, you know, thereâ€™s nothing to be afraid of,â€ I added sharply; and
she looked up in my face with the smile women use when they know we are
talking idly, yet do not wish to tell us so.

â€œ_You_ donâ€™t feel afraid, I know,â€ she observed quietly.

â€œOf course not; why should I?â€

â€œSo, if you will just humour me this once I--I will never ask anything
foolish of you again as long as I live,â€ she said gratefully.

â€œYou have my promise,â€ was all I could find to say.

She headed the nose of the canoe for the lagoon lying a quarter of a
mile ahead, and paddled swiftly; but a minute or two later she paused
again and stared hard at me with the dripping paddle across the thwarts.

â€œYouâ€™ve not heard anything at night yourself, have you?â€ she asked.

â€œI never hear anything at night,â€ I replied shortly, â€œfrom the moment I
lie down till the moment I get up.â€

â€œThat dismal howling, for instance,â€ she went on, determined to get
it out, â€œfar away at first and then getting closer, and stopping just
outside the Camp?â€

â€œCertainly not.â€

â€œBecause, sometimes I think I almost dreamed it.â€

â€œMost likely you did,â€ was my unsympathetic response.

â€œAnd you donâ€™t think father has heard it either, then?â€

â€œNo. He would have told me if he had.â€

This seemed to relieve her mind a little. â€œI know mother hasnâ€™t,â€ she
added, as if speaking to herself, â€œfor she hears nothing--ever.â€

       *       *       *       *       *

It was two nights after this conversation that I woke out of deep
sleep and heard sounds of screaming. The voice was really horrible,
breaking the peace and silence with its shrill clamour. In less than
ten seconds I was half dressed and out of my tent. The screaming had
stopped abruptly, but I knew the general direction, and ran as fast as
the darkness would allow over to the womenâ€™s quarters, and on getting
close I heard sounds of suppressed weeping. It was Joanâ€™s voice. And
just as I came up I saw Mrs. Maloney, marvellously attired, fumbling
with a lantern. Other voices became audible in the same moment behind
me, and Timothy Maloney arrived, breathless, less than half dressed,
and carrying another lantern that had gone out on the way from being
banged against a tree. Dawn was just breaking, and a chill wind blew in
from the sea. Heavy black clouds drove low overhead.

The scene of confusion may be better imagined than described. Questions
in frightened voices filled the air against this background of
suppressed weeping. Briefly--Joanâ€™s silk tent had been torn, and the
girl was in a state bordering upon hysterics. Somewhat reassured by
our noisy presence, however,--for she was plucky at heart,--she pulled
herself together and tried to explain what had happened; and her broken
words, told there on the edge of night and morning upon this wild
island ridge, were oddly thrilling and distressingly convincing.

â€œSomething touched me and I woke,â€ she said simply, but in a voice
still hushed and broken with the terror of it, â€œsomething pushing
against the tent; I felt it through the canvas. There was the same
sniffing and scratching as before, and I felt the tent give a little
as when wind shakes it. I heard breathing--very loud, very heavy
breathing--and then came a sudden great tearing blow, and the canvas
ripped open close to my face.â€

She had instantly dashed out through the open flap and screamed at
the top of her voice, thinking the creature had actually got into the
tent. But nothing was visible, she declared, and she heard not the
faintest sound of an animal making off under cover of the darkness.
The brief account seemed to exercise a paralysing effect upon us all
as we listened to it. I can see the dishevelled group to this day, the
wind blowing the womenâ€™s hair, and Maloney craning his head forward to
listen, and his wife, open-mouthed and gasping, leaning against a pine
tree.

â€œCome over to the stockade and weâ€™ll get the fire going,â€ I said;
â€œthatâ€™s the first thing,â€ for we were all shaking with the cold in
our scanty garments. And at that moment Sangree arrived wrapped in a
blanket and carrying his gun; he was still drunken with sleep.

â€œThe dog again,â€ Maloney explained briefly, forestalling his questions;
â€œbeen at Joanâ€™s tent. Torn it, by Gad! this time. Itâ€™s time we did
something.â€ He went on mumbling confusedly to himself.

Sangree gripped his gun and looked about swiftly in the darkness. I
saw his eyes flame in the glare of the flickering lanterns. He made a
movement as though to start out and hunt--and kill. Then his glance
fell on the girl crouching on the ground, her face hidden in her
hands, and there leaped into his features an expression of savage
anger that transformed them. He could have faced a dozen lions with a
walking-stick at that moment, and again I liked him for the strength of
his anger, his self-control, and his hopeless devotion.

But I stopped him going off on a blind and useless chase.

â€œCome and help me start the fire, Sangree,â€ I said, anxious also to
relieve the girl of our presence; and a few minutes later the ashes,
still glowing from the nightâ€™s fire, had kindled the fresh wood,
and there was a blaze that warmed us well while it also lit up the
surrounding trees within a radius of twenty yards.

â€œI heard nothing,â€ he whispered; â€œwhat in the world do you think it is?
It surely canâ€™t be only a dog!â€

â€œWeâ€™ll find that out later,â€ I said, as the others came up to the
grateful warmth; â€œthe first thing is to make as big a fire as we can.â€

Joan was calmer now, and her mother had put on some warmer, and less
miraculous, garments. And while they stood talking in low voices
Maloney and I slipped off to examine the tent. There was little enough
to see, but that little was unmistakable. Some animal had scratched up
the ground at the head of the tent, and with a great blow of a powerful
paw--a paw clearly provided with good claws--had struck the silk and
torn it open. There was a hole large enough to pass a fist and arm
through.

â€œIt canâ€™t be far away,â€ Maloney said excitedly. â€œWeâ€™ll organise a hunt
at once; this very minute.â€

We hurried back to the fire, Maloney talking boisterously about his
proposed hunt. â€œThereâ€™s nothing like prompt action to dispel alarm,â€ he
whispered in my ear; and then turned to the rest of us.

â€œWeâ€™ll hunt the island from end to end at once,â€ he said, with
excitement; â€œthatâ€™s what weâ€™ll do. The beast canâ€™t be far away. And the
Bosunâ€™s Mate and Joan must come too, because they canâ€™t be left alone.
Hubbard, you take the right shore, and you, Sangree, the left, and
Iâ€™ll go in the middle with the women. In this way we can stretch clean
across the ridge, and nothing bigger than a rabbit can possibly escape
us.â€ He was extraordinarily excited, I thought. Anything affecting
Joan, of course, stirred him prodigiously. â€œGet your guns and weâ€™ll
start the drive at once,â€ he cried. He lit another lantern and handed
one each to his wife and Joan, and while I ran to fetch my gun I heard
him singing to himself with the excitement of it all.

Meanwhile the dawn had come on quickly. It made the flickering lanterns
look pale. The wind, too, was rising, and I heard the trees moaning
overhead and the waves breaking with increasing clamour on the shore.
In the lagoon the boat dipped and splashed, and the sparks from the
fire were carried aloft in a stream and scattered far and wide.

We made our way to the extreme end of the island, measured our
distances carefully, and then began to advance. None of us spoke.
Sangree and I, with cocked guns, watched the shore lines, and all
within easy touch and speaking distance. It was a slow and blundering
drive, and there were many false alarms, but after the best part of
half an hour we stood on the farther end, having made the complete
tour, and without putting up so much as a squirrel. Certainly there was
no living creature on that island but ourselves.

â€œ_I_ know what it is!â€ cried Maloney, looking out over the dim expanse
of grey sea, and speaking with the air of a man making a discovery;
â€œitâ€™s a dog from one of the farms on the larger islandsâ€--he pointed
seawards where the archipelago thickened--â€œand itâ€™s escaped and turned
wild. Our fires and voices attracted it, and itâ€™s probably half starved
as well as savage, poor brute!â€

No one said anything in reply, and he began to sing again very low to
himself.

The point where we stood--a huddled, shivering group--faced the wider
channels that led to the open sea and Finland. The grey dawn had broken
in earnest at last, and we could see the racing waves with their angry
crests of white. The surrounding islands showed up as dark masses
in the distance, and in the east, almost as Maloney spoke, the sun
came up with a rush in a stormy and magnificent sky of red and gold.
Against this splashed and gorgeous background black clouds, shaped
like fantastic and legendary animals, filed past swiftly in a tearing
stream, and to this day I have only to close my eyes to see again that
vivid and hurrying procession in the air. All about us the pines made
black splashes against the sky. It was an angry sunrise. Rain, indeed,
had already begun to fall in big drops.

We turned, as by a common instinct, and, without speech, made our way
back slowly to the stockade, Maloney humming snatches of his songs,
Sangree in front with his gun, prepared to shoot at a momentâ€™s notice,
and the women floundering in the rear with myself and the extinguished
lanterns.

Yet it was only a dog!

Really, it was most singular when one came to reflect soberly upon
it all. Events, say the occultists, have souls, or at least that
agglomerate life due to the emotions and thoughts of all concerned
in them, so that cities, and even whole countries, have great
astral shapes which may become visible to the eye of vision; and
certainly here, the soul of this drive--this vain, blundering, futile
drive--stood somewhere between ourselves and--laughed.

All of us heard that laugh, and all of us tried hard to smother the
sound, or at least to ignore it. Every one talked at once, loudly, and
with exaggerated decision, obviously trying to say something plausible
against heavy odds, striving to explain naturally that an animal might
so easily conceal itself from us, or swim away before we had time to
light upon its trail. For we all spoke of that â€œtrailâ€ as though it
really existed, and we had more to go upon than the mere marks of
paws about the tents of Joan and the Canadian. Indeed, but for these,
and the torn tent, I think it would, of course, have been possible to
ignore the existence of this beast intruder altogether.

And it was here, under this angry dawn, as we stood in the shelter of
the stockade from the pouring rain, weary yet so strangely excited--it
was here, out of this confusion of voices and explanations, that--very
stealthily--the ghost of something horrible slipped in and stood among
us. It made all our explanations seem childish and untrue; the false
relation was instantly exposed. Eyes exchanged quick, anxious glances,
questioning, expressive of dismay. There was a sense of wonder, of
poignant distress, and of trepidation. Alarm stood waiting at our
elbows. We shivered.

Then, suddenly, as we looked into each otherâ€™s faces, came the long,
unwelcome pause in which this new arrival established itself in our
hearts.

And, without further speech, or attempt at explanation, Maloney moved
off abruptly to mix the porridge for an early breakfast; Sangree to
clean the fish; myself to chop wood and tend the fire; Joan and her
mother to change their wet garments; and, most significant of all, to
prepare her motherâ€™s tent for its future complement of two.

Each went to his duty, but hurriedly, awkwardly, silently; and this new
arrival, this shape of terror and distress stalked, viewless, by the
side of each.

â€œIf only I could have traced that dog,â€ I think was the thought in the
minds of all.

       *       *       *       *       *

But in Camp, where every one realises how important the individual
contribution is to the comfort and well-being of all, the mind speedily
recovers tone and pulls itself together.

During the day, a day of heavy and ceaseless rain, we kept more or less
to our tents, and though there were signs of mysterious conferences
between the three members of the Maloney family, I think that most of
us slept a good deal and stayed alone with his thoughts. Certainly, I
did, because when Maloney came to say that his wife invited us all to a
special â€œteaâ€ in her tent, he had to shake me awake before I realised
that he was there at all.

And by supper-time we were more or less even-minded again, and almost
jolly. I only noticed that there was an undercurrent of what is best
described as â€œjumpiness,â€ and that the merest snapping of a twig, or
plop of a fish in the lagoon, was sufficient to make us start and look
over our shoulders. Pauses were rare in our talk, and the fire was
never for one instant allowed to get low. The wind and rain had ceased,
but the dripping of the branches still kept up an excellent imitation
of a downpour. In particular, Maloney was vigilant and alert, telling
us a series of tales in which the wholesome humorous element was
especially strong. He lingered, too, behind with me after Sangree had
gone to bed, and while I mixed myself a glass of hot Swedish punch, he
did a thing I had never known him do before--he mixed one for himself,
and then asked me to light him over to his tent. We said nothing on
the way, but I felt that he was glad of my companionship.

I returned alone to the stockade, and for a long time after that kept
the fire blazing, and sat up smoking and thinking. I hardly knew why;
but sleep was far from me for one thing, and for another, an idea
was taking form in my mind that required the comfort of tobacco and
a bright fire for its growth. I lay against a corner of the stockade
seat, listening to the wind whispering and to the ceaseless drip-drip
of the trees. The night, otherwise, was very still, and the sea quiet
as a lake. I remember that I was conscious, peculiarly conscious, of
this host of desolate islands crowding about us in the darkness, and
that we were the one little spot of humanity in a rather wonderful kind
of wilderness.

But this, I think, was the only symptom that came to warn me of
highly strung nerves, and it certainly was not sufficiently alarming
to destroy my peace of mind. One thing, however, did come to disturb
my peace, for just as I finally made ready to go, and had kicked the
embers of the fire into a last effort, I fancied I saw, peering at me
round the farther end of the stockade wall, a dark and shadowy mass
that might have been--that strongly resembled, in fact--the body of a
large animal. Two glowing eyes shone for an instant in the middle of
it. But the next second I saw that it was merely a projecting mass of
moss and lichen in the wall of our stockade, and the eyes were a couple
of wandering sparks from the dying ashes I had kicked. It was easy
enough, too, to imagine I saw an animal moving here and there between
the trees, as I picked my way stealthily to my tent. Of course, the
shadows tricked me.

And though it was after one oâ€™clock, Maloneyâ€™s light was still burning,
for I saw his tent shining white among the pines.

It was, however, in the short space between consciousness and
sleep--that time when the body is low and the voices of the submerged
region tell sometimes true--that the idea which had been all this
while maturing reached the point of an actual decision, and I suddenly
realised that I had resolved to send word to Dr. Silence. For, with
a sudden wonder that I had hitherto been so blind, the unwelcome
conviction dawned upon me all at once that some dreadful thing was
lurking about us on this island, and that the safety of at least one
of us was threatened by something monstrous and unclean that was too
horrible to contemplate. And, again remembering those last words of his
as the train moved out of the platform, I understood that Dr. Silence
would hold himself in readiness to come.

â€œUnless you should send for me sooner,â€ he had said.

       *       *       *       *       *

I found myself suddenly wide awake. It is impossible to say what woke
me, but it was no gradual process, seeing that I jumped from deep sleep
to absolute alertness in a single instant. I had evidently slept for an
hour and more, for the night had cleared, stars crowded the sky, and
a pallid half-moon just sinking into the sea threw a spectral light
between the trees.

I went outside to sniff the air, and stood upright. A curious
impression that something was astir in the Camp came over me, and when
I glanced across at Sangreeâ€™s tent, some twenty feet away, I saw that
it was moving. He too, then, was awake and restless, for I saw the
canvas sides bulge this way and that as he moved within.

Then the flap pushed forward. He was coming out, like myself, to sniff
the air; and I was not surprised, for its sweetness after the rain was
intoxicating. And he came on all fours, just as I had done. I saw a
head thrust round the edge of the tent.

And then I saw that it was not Sangree at all. It was an animal. And
the same instant I realised something else too--it was _the_ animal;
and its whole presentment for some unaccountable reason was unutterably
malefic.

A cry I was quite unable to suppress escaped me, and the creature
turned on the instant and stared at me with baleful eyes. I could
have dropped on the spot, for the strength all ran out of my body
with a rush. Something about it touched in me the living terror that
grips and paralyses. If the mind requires but the tenth of a second
to form an impression, I must have stood there stockstill for several
seconds while I seized the ropes for support and stared. Many and vivid
impressions flashed through my mind, but not one of them resulted in
action, because I was in instant dread that the beast any moment would
leap in my direction and be upon me. Instead, however, after what
seemed a vast period, it slowly turned its eyes from my face, uttered a
low whining sound, and came out altogether into the open.

Then, for the first time, I saw it in its entirety and noted two
things: it was about the size of a large dog, but at the same time it
was utterly unlike any animal that I had ever seen. Also, that the
quality that had impressed me first as being malefic, was really only
its singular and original strangeness. Foolish as it may sound, and
impossible as it is for me to adduce proof, I can only say that the
animal seemed to me then to be--not real.

But all this passed through my mind in a flash, almost subconsciously,
and before I had time to check my impressions, or even properly verify
them; I made an involuntary movement, catching the tight rope in my
hand so that it twanged like a banjo string, and in that instant the
creature turned the corner of Sangreeâ€™s tent and was gone into the
darkness.

Then, of course, my senses in some measure returned to me, and I
realised only one thing: it had been inside his tent!

I dashed out, reached the door in half a dozen strides, and looked in.
The Canadian, thank God! lay upon his bed of branches. His arm was
stretched outside, across the blankets, the fist tightly clenched, and
the body had an appearance of unusual rigidity that was alarming. On
his face there was an expression of effort, almost of painful effort,
so far as the uncertain light permitted me to see, and his sleep seemed
to be very profound. He looked, I thought, so stiff, so unnaturally
stiff, and in some indefinable way, too, he looked smaller--shrunken.

I called to him to wake, but called many times in vain. Then I decided
to shake him, and had already moved forward to do so vigorously when
there came a sound of footsteps padding softly behind me, and I felt a
stream of hot breath burn my neck as I stooped. I turned sharply. The
tent door was darkened and something silently swept in. I felt a rough
and shaggy body push past me, and knew that the animal had returned. It
seemed to leap forward between me and Sangree--in fact, to leap upon
Sangree, for its dark body hid him momentarily from view, and in that
moment my soul turned sick and coward with a horror that rose from the
very dregs and depth of life, and gripped my existence at its central
source.

The creature seemed somehow to melt away into him, almost as though
it belonged to him and were a part of himself, but in the same
instant--that instant of extraordinary confusion and terror in my
mind--it seemed to pass over and behind him, and, in some utterly
unaccountable fashion, it was gone! And the Canadian woke and sat up
with a start.

â€œQuick! You fool!â€ I cried, in my excitement, â€œthe beast has been in
your tent, here at your very throat while you sleep like the dead. Up,
man! Get your gun! Only this second it disappeared over there behind
your head. Quick! or Joan----!â€

And somehow the fact that he was there, wide-awake now, to corroborate
me, brought the additional conviction to my own mind that this was no
animal, but some perplexing and dreadful form of life that drew upon my
deeper knowledge, that much reading had perhaps assented to, but that
had never yet come within actual range of my senses.

He was up in a flash, and out. He was trembling, and very white. We
searched hurriedly, feverishly, but found only the traces of paw-marks
passing from the door of his own tent across the moss to the womenâ€™s.
And the sight of the tracks about Mrs. Maloneyâ€™s tent, where Joan now
slept, set him in a perfect fury.

â€œDo you know what it is, Hubbard, this beast?â€ he hissed under his
breath at me; â€œitâ€™s a damned wolf, thatâ€™s what it is--a wolf lost among
the islands, and starving to death--desperate. So help me God, I
believe itâ€™s that!â€

He talked a lot of rubbish in his excitement. He declared he would
sleep by day and sit up every night until he killed it. Again his rage
touched my admiration; but I got him away before he made enough noise
to wake the whole Camp.

â€œI have a better plan than that,â€ I said, watching his face closely. â€œI
donâ€™t think this is anything we can deal with. Iâ€™m going to send for
the only man I know who can help. Weâ€™ll go to Waxholm this very morning
and get a telegram through.â€

Sangree stared at me with a curious expression as the fury died out of
his face and a new look of alarm took its place.

â€œJohn Silence,â€ I said, â€œwill know----â€

â€œYou think itâ€™s something--of that sort?â€ he stammered.

â€œI am sure of it.â€

There was a momentâ€™s pause. â€œThatâ€™s worse, far worse than anything
material,â€ he said, turning visibly paler. He looked from my face to
the sky, and then added with sudden resolution, â€œCome; the windâ€™s
rising. Letâ€™s get off at once. From there you can telephone to
Stockholm and get a telegram sent without delay.â€

I sent him down to get the boat ready, and seized the opportunity
myself to run and wake Maloney. He was sleeping very lightly, and
sprang up the moment I put my head inside his tent. I told him briefly
what I had seen, and he showed so little surprise that I caught myself
wondering for the first time whether he himself had seen more going on
than he had deemed wise to communicate to the rest of us.

He agreed to my plan without a momentâ€™s hesitation, and my last
words to him were to let his wife and daughter think that the great
psychic doctor was coming merely as a chance visitor, and not with any
professional interest.

So, with frying-pan, provisions, and blankets aboard, Sangree and I
sailed out of the lagoon fifteen minutes later, and headed with a good
breeze for the direction of Waxholm and the borders of civilisation.


IV

Although nothing John Silence did ever took me, properly speaking, by
surprise, it was certainly unexpected to find a letter from Stockholm
waiting for me. â€œI have finished my Hungary business,â€ he wrote, â€œand
am here for ten days. Do not hesitate to send if you need me. If you
telephone any morning from Waxholm I can catch the afternoon steamer.â€

My years of intercourse with him were full of â€œcoincidencesâ€ of this
description, and although he never sought to explain them by claiming
any magical system of communication with my mind, I have never doubted
that there actually existed some secret telepathic method by which he
knew my circumstances and gauged the degree of my need. And that this
power was independent of time in the sense that it saw into the future,
always seemed to me equally apparent.

Sangree was as much relieved as I was, and within an hour of sunset
that very evening we met him on the arrival of the little coasting
steamer, and carried him off in the dinghy to the camp we had prepared
on a neighbouring island, meaning to start for home early next morning.

â€œNow,â€ he said, when supper was over and we were smoking round the
fire, â€œlet me hear your story.â€ He glanced from one to the other,
smiling.

â€œYou tell it, Mr. Hubbard,â€ Sangree interrupted abruptly, and went
off a little way to wash the dishes, yet not so far as to be out of
earshot. And while he splashed with the hot water, and scraped the tin
plates with sand and moss, my voice, unbroken by a single question from
Dr. Silence, ran on for the next half-hour with the best account I
could give of what had happened.

My listener lay on the other side of the fire, his face half hidden
by a big sombrero; sometimes he glanced up questioningly when a
point needed elaboration, but he uttered no single word till I had
reached the end, and his manner all through the recital was grave and
attentive. Overhead, the wash of the wind in the pine branches filled
in the pauses; the darkness settled down over the sea, and the stars
came out in thousands, and by the time I finished the moon had risen to
flood the scene with silver. Yet, by his face and eyes, I knew quite
well that the doctor was listening to something he had expected to
hear, even if he had not actually anticipated all the details.

â€œYou did well to send for me,â€ he said very low, with a significant
glance at me when I finished; â€œvery well,â€--and for one swift second
his eye took in Sangree,--â€œfor what we have to deal with here is
nothing more than a werewolf--rare enough, I am glad to say, but often
very sad, and sometimes very terrible.â€

I jumped as though I had been shot, but the next second was heartily
ashamed of my want of control; for this brief remark, confirming as
it did my own worst suspicions, did more to convince me of the gravity
of the adventure than any number of questions or explanations. It
seemed to draw close the circle about us, shutting a door somewhere
that locked us in with the animal and the horror, and turning the key.
Whatever it was had now to be faced and dealt with.

â€œNo one has been actually injured so far?â€ he asked aloud, but in a
matter-of-fact tone that lent reality to grim possibilities.

â€œGood heavens, no!â€ cried the Canadian, throwing down his dish-cloths
and coming forward into the circle of firelight. â€œSurely there can be
no question of this poor starved beast injuring anybody, can there?â€

His hair straggled untidily over his forehead, and there was a gleam in
his eyes that was not all reflection from the fire. His words made me
turn sharply. We all laughed a little, short, forced laugh.

â€œI trust not, indeed,â€ Dr. Silence said quietly. â€œBut what makes you
think the creature is starved?â€ He asked the question with his eyes
straight on the otherâ€™s face. The prompt question explained to me why
I had started, and I waited with just a tremor of excitement for the
reply.

Sangree hesitated a moment, as though the question took him by
surprise. But he met the doctorâ€™s gaze unflinchingly across the fire,
and with complete honesty.

â€œReally,â€ he faltered, with a little shrug of the shoulders, â€œI can
hardly tell you. The phrase seemed to come out of its own accord. I
have felt from the beginning that it was in pain and--starved, though
why I felt this never occurred to me till you asked.â€

â€œYou really know very little about it, then?â€ said the other, with a
sudden gentleness in his voice.

â€œNo more than that,â€ Sangree replied, looking at him with a puzzled
expression that was unmistakably genuine. â€œIn fact, nothing at all,
really,â€ he added, by way of further explanation.

â€œI am glad of that,â€ I heard the doctor murmur under his breath, but
so low that I only just caught the words, and Sangree missed them
altogether, as evidently he was meant to do.

â€œAnd now,â€ he cried, getting on his feet and shaking himself with a
characteristic gesture, as though to shake out the horror and the
mystery, â€œlet us leave the problem till to-morrow and enjoy this wind
and sea and stars. Iâ€™ve been living lately in the atmosphere of many
people, and feel that I want to wash and be clean. I propose a swim and
then bed. Whoâ€™ll second me?â€ And two minutes later we were all diving
from the boat into cool, deep water, that reflected a thousand moons as
the waves broke away from us in countless ripples.

We slept in blankets under the open sky, Sangree and I taking the
outside places, and were up before sunrise to catch the dawn wind.
Helped by this early start we were half-way home by noon, and then the
wind shifted to a few points behind us so that we fairly ran. In and
out among a thousand islands, down narrow channels where we lost the
wind, out into open spaces where we had to take in a reef, racing along
under a hot and cloudless sky, we flew through the very heart of the
bewildering and lonely scenery.

â€œA real wilderness,â€ cried Dr. Silence from his seat in the bows where
he held the jib sheet. His hat was off, his hair tumbled in the wind,
and his lean brown face gave him the touch of an Oriental. Presently
he changed places with Sangree, and came down to talk with me by the
tiller.

â€œA wonderful region, all this world of islands,â€ he said, waving his
hand to the scenery rushing past us, â€œbut doesnâ€™t it strike you thereâ€™s
something lacking?â€

â€œItâ€™s--hard,â€ I answered, after a momentâ€™s reflection. â€œIt has a
superficial, glittering prettiness, without----â€ I hesitated to find
the word I wanted.

John Silence nodded his head with approval.

â€œExactly,â€ he said. â€œThe picturesqueness of stage scenery that is not
real, not alive. Itâ€™s like a landscape by a clever painter, yet without
true imagination. Soulless--thatâ€™s the word you wanted.â€

â€œSomething like that,â€ I answered, watching the gusts of wind on the
sails. â€œNot dead so much, as without soul. Thatâ€™s it.â€

â€œOf course,â€ he went on, in a voice calculated, it seemed to me, not
to reach our companion in the bows, â€œto live long in a place like
this--long and alone--might bring about a strange result in some men.â€

I suddenly realised he was talking with a purpose and pricked up my
ears.

â€œThereâ€™s no life here. These islands are mere dead rocks pushed up from
below the sea--not living land; and thereâ€™s nothing really alive on
them. Even the sea, this tideless, brackish sea, neither salt water nor
fresh, is dead. Itâ€™s all a pretty image of life without the real heart
and soul of life. To a man with too strong desires who came here and
lived close to nature, strange things might happen.â€

â€œLet her out a bit,â€ I shouted to Sangree, who was coming aft. â€œThe
windâ€™s gusty and weâ€™ve got hardly any ballast.â€

He went back to the bows, and Dr. Silence continued--

â€œHere, I mean, a long sojourn would lead to deterioration, to
degeneration. The place is utterly unsoftened by human influences, by
any humanising associations of history, good or bad. This landscape has
never awakened into life; itâ€™s still dreaming in its primitive sleep.â€

â€œIn time,â€ I put in, â€œyou mean a man living here might become brutal?â€

â€œThe passions would run wild, selfishness become supreme, the instincts
coarsen and turn savage probably.â€

â€œBut----â€

â€œIn other places just as wild, parts of Italy for instance, where there
are other moderating influences, it could not happen. The character
might grow wild, savage too in a sense, but with a human wildness one
could understand and deal with. But here, in a hard place like this, it
might be otherwise.â€ He spoke slowly, weighing his words carefully.

I looked at him with many questions in my eyes, and a precautionary cry
to Sangree to stay in the fore part of the boat, out of earshot.

â€œFirst of all there would come callousness to pain, and indifference
to the rights of others. Then the soul would turn savage, not from
passionate human causes, or with enthusiasm, but by deadening down into
a kind of cold, primitive, emotionless savagery--by turning, like the
landscape, soulless.â€

â€œAnd a man with strong desires, you say, might change?â€

â€œWithout being aware of it, yes; he might turn savage, his instincts
and desires turn animal. And ifâ€--he lowered his voice and turned for
a moment towards the bows, and then continued in his most weighty
manner--â€œowing to delicate health or other predisposing causes, his
Double--you know what I mean, of course--his etheric Body of Desire, or
astral body, as some term it--that part in which the emotions, passions
and desires reside--if this, I say, were for some constitutional reason
loosely joined to his physical organism, there might well take place an
occasional projection----â€

Sangree came aft with a sudden rush, his face aflame, but whether with
wind or sun, or with what he had heard, I cannot say. In my surprise
I let the tiller slip and the cutter gave a great plunge as she came
sharply into the wind and flung us all together in a heap on the
bottom. Sangree said nothing, but while he scrambled up and made the
jib sheet fast my companion found a moment to add to his unfinished
sentence the words, too low for any ear but mine--

â€œEntirely unknown to himself, however.â€

We righted the boat and laughed, and then Sangree produced the map
and explained exactly where we were. Far away on the horizon, across
an open stretch of water, lay a blue cluster of islands with our
crescent-shaped home among them and the safe anchorage of the lagoon.
An hour with this wind would get us there comfortably, and while Dr.
Silence and Sangree fell into conversation, I sat and pondered over the
strange suggestions that had just been put into my mind concerning
the â€œDouble,â€ and the possible form it might assume when dissociated
temporarily from the physical body.

The whole way home these two chatted, and John Silence was as gentle
and sympathetic as a woman. I did not hear much of their talk, for the
wind grew occasionally to the force of a hurricane and the sails and
tiller absorbed my attention; but I could see that Sangree was pleased
and happy, and was pouring out intimate revelations to his companion in
the way that most people did--when John Silence wished them to do so.

But it was quite suddenly, while I sat all intent upon wind and sails,
that the true meaning of Sangreeâ€™s remark about the animal flared up in
me with its full import. For his admission that he knew it was in pain
and starved was in reality nothing more or less than a revelation of
his deeper self. It was in the nature of a confession. He was speaking
of something that he knew positively, something that was beyond
question or argument, something that had to do directly with himself.
â€œPoor starved beastâ€ he had called it in words that had â€œcome out of
their own accord,â€ and there had not been the slightest evidence of any
desire to conceal or explain away. He had spoken instinctively--from
his heart, and as though about his own self.

And half an hour before sunset we raced through the narrow opening of
the lagoon and saw the smoke of the dinner-fire blowing here and there
among the trees, and the figures of Joan and the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate running
down to meet us at the landing-stage.


V

Everything changed from the moment John Silence set foot on that
island; it was like the effect produced by calling in some big doctor,
some great arbiter of life and death, for consultation. The sense of
gravity increased a hundredfold. Even inanimate objects took upon
themselves a subtle alteration, for the setting of the adventure--this
deserted bit of sea with its hundreds of uninhabited islands--somehow
turned sombre. An element that was mysterious, and in a sense
disheartening, crept unbidden into the severity of grey rock and dark
pine forest and took the sparkle from the sunshine and the sea.

I, at least, was keenly aware of the change, for my whole being
shifted, as it were, a degree higher, becoming keyed up and alert.
The figures from the background of the stage moved forward a little
into the light--nearer to the inevitable action. In a word this manâ€™s
arrival intensified the whole affair.

And, looking back down the years to the time when all this happened,
it is clear to me that he had a pretty sharp idea of the meaning of it
from the very beginning. How much he knew beforehand by his strange
divining powers, it is impossible to say, but from the moment he came
upon the scene and caught within himself the note of what was going on
amongst us, he undoubtedly held the true solution of the puzzle and had
no need to ask questions. And this certitude it was that set him in
such an atmosphere of power and made us all look to him instinctively;
for he took no tentative steps, made no false moves, and while the rest
of us floundered he moved straight to the climax. He was indeed a true
diviner of souls.

I can now read into his behaviour a good deal that puzzled me at the
time, for though I had dimly guessed the solution, I had no idea how
he would deal with it. And the conversations I can reproduce almost
verbatim, for, according to my invariable habit, I kept full notes of
all he said.

To Mrs. Maloney, foolish and dazed; to Joan, alarmed, yet plucky;
and to the clergyman, moved by his daughterâ€™s distress below his
usual shallow emotions, he gave the best possible treatment in the
best possible way, yet all so easily and simply as to make it appear
naturally spontaneous. For he dominated the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate, taking the
measure of her ignorance with infinite patience; he keyed up Joan,
stirring her courage and interest to the highest point for her own
safety; and the Reverend Timothy he soothed and comforted, while
obtaining his implicit obedience, by taking him into his confidence,
and leading him gradually to a comprehension of the issue that was
bound to follow.

And Sangree--here his wisdom was most wisely calculated--he neglected
outwardly because inwardly he was the object of his unceasing and most
concentrated attention. Under the guise of apparent indifference his
mind kept the Canadian under constant observation.

There was a restless feeling in the Camp that evening and none of us
lingered round the fire after supper as usual. Sangree and I busied
ourselves with patching up the torn tent for our guest and with finding
heavy stones to hold the ropes, for Dr. Silence insisted on having it
pitched on the highest point of the island ridge, just where it was
most rocky and there was no earth for pegs. The place, moreover, was
midway between the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s tents, and, of course, commanded
the most comprehensive view of the Camp.

â€œSo that if your dog comes,â€ he said simply, â€œI may be able to catch
him as he passes across.â€

The wind had gone down with the sun and an unusual warmth lay over the
island that made sleep heavy, and in the morning we assembled at a
late breakfast, rubbing our eyes and yawning. The cool north wind had
given way to the warm southern air that sometimes came up with haze and
moisture across the Baltic, bringing with it the relaxing sensations
that produced enervation and listlessness.

And this may have been the reason why at first I failed to notice that
anything unusual was about, and why I was less alert than normally; for
it was not till after breakfast that the silence of our little party
struck me and I discovered that Joan had not yet put in an appearance.
And then, in a flash, the last heaviness of sleep vanished and I saw
that Maloney was white and troubled and his wife could not hold a plate
without trembling.

A desire to ask questions was stopped in me by a swift glance from
Dr. Silence, and I suddenly understood in some vague way that they
were waiting till Sangree should have gone. How this idea came to me I
cannot determine, but the soundness of the intuition was soon proved,
for the moment he moved off to his tent, Maloney looked up at me and
began to speak in a low voice.

â€œYou slept through it all,â€ he half whispered.

â€œThrough what?â€ I asked, suddenly thrilled with the knowledge that
something dreadful had happened.

â€œWe didnâ€™t wake you for fear of getting the whole Camp up,â€ he went on,
meaning, by the Camp, I supposed, Sangree. â€œIt was just before dawn
when the screams woke me.â€

â€œThe dog again?â€ I asked, with a curious sinking of the heart.

â€œGot right into the tent,â€ he went on, speaking passionately but very
low, â€œand woke my wife by scrambling all over her. Then she realised
that Joan was struggling beside her. And, by God! the beast had torn
her arm; scratched all down the arm she was, and bleeding.â€

â€œJoan injured?â€ I gasped.

â€œMerely scratched--this time,â€ put in John Silence, speaking for the
first time; â€œsuffering more from shock and fright than actual wounds.â€

â€œIsnâ€™t it a mercy the doctor was here,â€ said Mrs. Maloney, looking as
if she would never know calmness again. â€œI think we should both have
been killed.â€

â€œIt has been a most merciful escape,â€ Maloney said, his pulpit
voice struggling with his emotion. â€œBut, of course, we cannot risk
another--we must strike Camp and get away at once----â€

â€œOnly poor Mr. Sangree must not know what has happened. He is so
attached to Joan and would be so terribly upset,â€ added the Boâ€™sunâ€™s
Mate distractedly, looking all about in her terror.

â€œIt is perhaps advisable that Mr. Sangree should not know what has
occurred,â€ Dr. Silence said with quiet authority, â€œbut I think, for the
safety of all concerned, it will be better not to leave the island just
now.â€ He spoke with great decision and Maloney looked up and followed
his words closely.

â€œIf you will agree to stay here a few days longer, I have no doubt
we can put an end to the attentions of your strange visitor, and
incidentally have the opportunity of observing a most singular and
interesting phenomenon----â€

â€œWhat!â€ gasped Mrs. Maloney, â€œa phenomenon?--you mean that you know
what it is?â€

â€œI am quite certain I know what it is,â€ he replied very low, for we
heard the footsteps of Sangree approaching, â€œthough I am not so certain
yet as to the best means of dealing with it. But in any case it is not
wise to leave precipitately----â€

â€œOh, Timothy, does he think itâ€™s a devil----?â€ cried the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate
in a voice that even the Canadian must have heard.

â€œIn my opinion,â€ continued John Silence, looking across at me and the
clergyman, â€œit is a case of modern lycanthropy with other complications
that may----â€ He left the sentence unfinished, for Mrs. Maloney got up
with a jump and fled to her tent fearful she might hear a worse thing,
and at that moment Sangree turned the corner of the stockade and came
into view.

â€œThere are footmarks all round the mouth of my tent,â€ he said with
excitement. â€œThe animal has been here again in the night. Dr. Silence,
you really must come and see them for yourself. Theyâ€™re as plain on the
moss as tracks in snow.â€

But later in the day, while Sangree went off in the canoe to fish
the pools near the larger islands, and Joan still lay, bandaged and
resting, in her tent, Dr. Silence called me and the tutor and proposed
a walk to the granite slabs at the far end. Mrs. Maloney sat on
a stump near her daughter, and busied herself energetically with
alternate nursing and painting.

â€œWeâ€™ll leave you in charge,â€ the doctor said with a smile that was
meant to be encouraging, â€œand when you want us for lunch, or anything,
the megaphone will always bring us back in time.â€

For, though the very air was charged with strange emotions, every one
talked quietly and naturally as with a definite desire to counteract
unnecessary excitement.

â€œIâ€™ll keep watch,â€ said the plucky Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate, â€œand meanwhile I find
comfort in my work.â€ She was busy with the sketch she had begun on the
day after our arrival. â€œFor even a tree,â€ she added proudly, pointing
to her little easel, â€œis a symbol of the divine, and the thought makes
me feel safer.â€ We glanced for a moment at a daub which was more like
the symptom of a disease than a symbol of the divine--and then took the
path round the lagoon.

At the far end we made a little fire and lay round it in the shadow of
a big boulder. Maloney stopped his humming suddenly and turned to his
companion.

â€œAnd what do you make of it all?â€ he asked abruptly.

â€œIn the first place,â€ replied John Silence, making himself comfortable
against the rock, â€œit is of human origin, this animal; it is undoubted
lycanthropy.â€

His words had the effect precisely of a bombshell. Maloney listened as
though he had been struck.

â€œYou puzzle me utterly,â€ he said, sitting up closer and staring at him.

â€œPerhaps,â€ replied the other, â€œbut if youâ€™ll listen to me for a few
moments you may be less puzzled at the end--or more. It depends how
much you know. Let me go further and say that you have underestimated,
or miscalculated, the effect of this primitive wild life upon all of
you.â€

â€œIn what way?â€ asked the clergyman, bristling a trifle.

â€œIt is strong medicine for any town-dweller, and for some of you it has
been too strong. One of you has gone wild.â€ He uttered these last words
with great emphasis.

â€œGone savage,â€ he added, looking from one to the other.

Neither of us found anything to reply.

â€œTo say that the brute has awakened in a man is not a mere metaphor
always,â€ he went on presently.

â€œOf course not!â€

â€œBut, in the sense I mean, may have a very literal and terrible
significance,â€ pursued Dr. Silence. â€œAncient instincts that no one
dreamed of, least of all their possessor, may leap forth----â€

â€œAtavism can hardly explain a roaming animal with teeth and claws and
sanguinary instincts,â€ interrupted Maloney with impatience.

â€œThe term is of your own choice,â€ continued the doctor equably, â€œnot
mine, and it is a good example of a word that indicates a result while
it conceals the process; but the explanation of this beast that haunts
your island and attacks your daughter is of far deeper significance
than mere atavistic tendencies, or throwing back to animal origin,
which I suppose is the thought in your mind.â€

â€œYou spoke just now of lycanthropy,â€ said Maloney, looking bewildered
and anxious to keep to plain facts evidently, â€œI think I have come
across the word, but really--really--it can have no actual significance
to-day, can it? These superstitions of mediÃ¦val times can hardly----â€

He looked round at me with his jolly red face, and the expression of
astonishment and dismay on it would have made me shout with laughter at
any other time. Laughter, however, was never farther from my mind than
at this moment when I listened to Dr. Silence as he carefully suggested
to the clergyman the very explanation that had gradually been forcing
itself upon my own mind.

â€œHowever mediÃ¦val ideas may have exaggerated the idea is not of much
importance to us now,â€ he said quietly, â€œwhen we are face to face with
a modern example of what, I take it, has always been a profound fact.
For the moment let us leave the name of any one in particular out of
the matter and consider certain possibilities.â€

We all agreed with that at any rate. There was no need to speak of
Sangree, or of any one else, until we knew a little more.

â€œThe fundamental fact in this most curious case,â€ he went on, â€œis that
the â€˜Doubleâ€™ of a man----â€

â€œYou mean the astral body? Iâ€™ve heard of that, of course,â€ broke in
Maloney with a snort of triumph.

â€œNo doubt,â€ said the other, smiling, â€œno doubt you have;--that this
Double, or fluidic body of a man, as I was saying, has the power under
certain conditions of projecting itself and becoming visible to others.
Certain training will accomplish this, and certain drugs likewise;
illnesses, too, that ravage the body may produce temporarily the result
that death produces permanently, and let loose this counterpart of a
human being and render it visible to the sight of others.

â€œEvery one, of course, knows this more or less to-day; but it is not so
generally known, and probably believed by none who have not witnessed
it, that this fluidic body can, under certain conditions, assume other
forms than human, and that such other forms may be determined by the
dominating thought and wish of the owner. For this Double, or astral
body as you call it, is really the seat of the passions, emotions and
desires in the psychical economy. It is the Passion Body; and, in
projecting itself, it can often assume a form that gives expression to
the overmastering desire that moulds it; for it is composed of such
tenuous matter that it lends itself readily to the moulding by thought
and wish.â€

â€œI follow you perfectly,â€ said Maloney, looking as if he would much
rather be chopping firewood elsewhere and singing.

â€œAnd there are some persons so constituted,â€ the doctor went on with
increasing seriousness, â€œthat the fluid body in them is but loosely
associated with the physical, persons of poor health as a rule, yet
often of strong desires and passions; and in these persons it is easy
for the Double to dissociate itself during deep sleep from their
system, and, driven forth by some consuming desire, to assume an animal
form and seek the fulfilment of that desire.â€

There, in broad daylight, I saw Maloney deliberately creep closer to
the fire and heap the wood on. We gathered in to the heat, and to each
other, and listened to Dr. Silenceâ€™s voice as it mingled with the swish
and whirr of the wind about us, and the falling of the little waves.

â€œFor instance, to take a concrete example,â€ he resumed; â€œsuppose some
young man, with the delicate constitution I have spoken of, forms an
overpowering attachment to a young woman, yet perceives that it is not
welcomed, and is man enough to repress its outward manifestations.
In such a case, supposing his Double be easily projected, the very
repression of his love in the daytime would add to the intense force of
his desire when released in deep sleep from the control of his will,
and his fluidic body might issue forth in monstrous or animal shape and
become actually visible to others. And, if his devotion were dog-like
in its fidelity, yet concealing the fires of a fierce passion beneath,
it might well assume the form of a creature that seemed to be half dog,
half wolf----â€

â€œA werewolf, you mean?â€ cried Maloney, pale to the lips as he listened.

John Silence held up a restraining hand. â€œA werewolf,â€ he said, â€œis a
true psychical fact of profound significance, however absurdly it may
have been exaggerated by the imaginations of a superstitious peasantry
in the days of unenlightenment, for a werewolf is nothing but the
savage, and possibly sanguinary, instincts of a passionate man scouring
the world in his fluidic body, his passion body, his body of desire. As
in the case at hand, he may not know it----â€

â€œIt is not necessarily deliberate, then?â€ Maloney put in quickly, with
relief.

â€œ----It is hardly ever deliberate. It is the desires released in sleep
from the control of the will finding a vent. In all savage races it has
been recognised and dreaded, this phenomenon styled â€˜Wehr Wolf,â€™ but
to-day it is rare. And it is becoming rarer still, for the world grows
tame and civilised, emotions have become refined, desires lukewarm, and
few men have savagery enough left in them to generate impulses of such
intense force, and certainly not to project them in animal form.â€

â€œBy Gad!â€ exclaimed the clergyman breathlessly, and with increasing
excitement, â€œthen I feel I must tell you--what has been given to me in
confidence--that Sangree has in him an admixture of savage blood--of
Red Indian ancestry----â€

â€œLet us stick to our supposition of a man as described,â€ the doctor
stopped him calmly, â€œand let us imagine that he has in him this
admixture of savage blood; and further, that he is wholly unaware of
his dreadful physical and psychical infirmity; and that he suddenly
finds himself leading the primitive life together with the object of
his desires; with the result that the strain of the untamed wild-man in
his blood----â€

â€œRed Indian, for instance,â€ from Maloney.

â€œRed Indian, perfectly,â€ agreed the doctor; â€œthe result, I say, that
this savage strain in him is awakened and leaps into passionate life.
What then?â€

He looked hard at Timothy Maloney, and the clergyman looked hard at him.

â€œThe wild life such as you lead it here on this island, for instance,
might quickly awaken his savage instincts--his buried instincts--and
with profoundly disquieting results.â€

â€œYou mean his Subtle Body, as you call it, might issue forth
automatically in deep sleep and seek the object of its desire?â€ I said,
coming to Maloneyâ€™s aid, who was finding it more and more difficult to
get words.

â€œPrecisely;--yet the desire of the man remaining utterly
unmalefic--pure and wholesome in every sense----â€

â€œAh!â€ I heard the clergyman gasp.

â€œThe loverâ€™s desire for union run wild, run savage, tearing its way out
in primitive, untamed fashion, I mean,â€ continued the doctor, striving
to make himself clear to a mind bounded by conventional thought and
knowledge; â€œfor the desire to possess, remember, may easily become
importunate, and, embodied in this animal form of the Subtle Body which
acts as its vehicle, may go forth to tear in pieces all that obstructs,
to reach to the very heart of the loved object and seize it. _Au fond_,
it is nothing more than the aspiration for union, as I said--the
splendid and perfectly clean desire to absorb utterly into itself----â€

He paused a moment and looked into Maloneyâ€™s eyes.

â€œTo bathe in the very heartâ€™s blood of the one desired,â€ he added with
grave emphasis.

The fire spurted and crackled and made me start, but Maloney found
relief in a genuine shudder, and I saw him turn his head and look about
him from the sea to the trees. The wind dropped just at that moment and
the doctorâ€™s words rang sharply through the stillness.

â€œThen it might even kill?â€ stammered the clergyman presently in a
hushed voice, and with a little forced laugh by way of protest that
sounded quite ghastly.

â€œIn the last resort it might kill,â€ repeated Dr. Silence. Then, after
another pause, during which he was clearly debating how much or how
little it was wise to give to his audience, he continued: â€œAnd if the
Double does not succeed in getting back to its physical body, that
physical body would wake an imbecile--an idiot--or perhaps never wake
at all.â€

Maloney sat up and found his tongue.

â€œYou mean that if this fluid animal thing, or whatever it is, should be
prevented getting back, the man might never wake again?â€ he asked, with
shaking voice.

â€œHe might be dead,â€ replied the other calmly. The tremor of a positive
sensation shivered in the air about us.

â€œThen isnâ€™t that the best way to cure the fool--the brute----?â€
thundered the clergyman, half rising to his feet.

â€œCertainly it would be an easy and undiscoverable form of murder,â€ was
the stern reply, spoken as calmly as though it were a remark about the
weather.

Maloney collapsed visibly, and I gathered the wood over the fire and
coaxed up a blaze.

â€œThe greater part of the manâ€™s life--of his vital forces--goes out with
this Double,â€ Dr. Silence resumed, after a momentâ€™s consideration, â€œand
a considerable portion of the actual material of his physical body. So
the physical body that remains behind is depleted, not only of force,
but of matter. You would see it small, shrunken, dropped together, just
like the body of a materialising medium at a sÃ©ance. Moreover, any mark
or injury inflicted upon this Double will be found exactly reproduced
by the phenomenon of repercussion upon the shrunken physical body lying
in its trance----â€

â€œAn injury inflicted upon the one you say would be reproduced also on
the other?â€ repeated Maloney, his excitement growing again.

â€œUndoubtedly,â€ replied the other quietly; â€œfor there exists all
the time a continuous connection between the physical body and the
Double--a connection of matter, though of exceedingly attenuated,
possibly of etheric, matter. The wound _travels_, so to speak, from one
to the other, and if this connection were broken the result would be
death.â€

â€œDeath,â€ repeated Maloney to himself, â€œdeath!â€ He looked anxiously at
our faces, his thoughts evidently beginning to clear.

â€œAnd this solidity?â€ he asked presently, after a general pause; â€œthis
tearing of tents and flesh; this howling, and the marks of paws? You
mean that the Double----?â€

â€œHas sufficient material drawn from the depleted body to produce
physical results? Certainly!â€ the doctor took him up. â€œAlthough to
explain at this moment such problems as the passage of matter through
matter would be as difficult as to explain how the thought of a mother
can actually break the bones of the child unborn.â€

Dr. Silence pointed out to sea, and Maloney, looking wildly about
him, turned with a violent start. I saw a canoe, with Sangree in the
stern-seat, slowly coming into view round the farther point. His hat
was off, and his tanned face for the first time appeared to me--to us
all, I think--as though it were the face of some one else. He looked
like a wild man. Then he stood up in the canoe to make a cast with the
rod, and he looked for all the world like an Indian. I recalled the
expression of his face as I had seen it once or twice, notably on that
occasion of the evening prayer, and an involuntary shudder ran down my
spine.

At that very instant he turned and saw us where we lay, and his face
broke into a smile, so that his teeth showed white in the sun. He
looked in his element, and exceedingly attractive. He called out
something about his fish, and soon after passed out of sight into the
lagoon.

For a time none of us said a word.

â€œAnd the cure?â€ ventured Maloney at length.

â€œIs not to quench this savage force,â€ replied Dr. Silence, â€œbut to
steer it better, and to provide other outlets. This is the solution
of all these problems of accumulated force, for this force is the raw
material of usefulness, and should be increased and cherished, not
by separating it from the body by death, but by raising it to higher
channels. The best and quickest cure of all,â€ he went on, speaking very
gently and with a hand upon the clergymanâ€™s arm, â€œis to lead it towards
its object, provided that object is not unalterably hostile--to let it
find rest where----â€

He stopped abruptly, and the eyes of the two men met in a single glance
of comprehension.

â€œJoan?â€ Maloney exclaimed, under his breath.

â€œJoan!â€ replied John Silence.

       *       *       *       *       *

We all went to bed early. The day had been unusually warm, and after
sunset a curious hush descended on the island. Nothing was audible but
that faint, ghostly singing which is inseparable from a pine-wood even
on the stillest day--a low, searching sound, as though the wind had
hair and trailed it oâ€™er the world.

With the sudden cooling of the atmosphere a sea fog began to form. It
appeared in isolated patches over the water, and then these patches
slid together and a white wall advanced upon us. Not a breath of air
stirred; the firs stood like flat metal outlines; the sea became as
oil. The whole scene lay as though held motionless by some huge weight
in the air; and the flames from our fire--the largest we had ever
made--rose upwards, straight as a church steeple.

As I followed the rest of our party tent-wards, having kicked the
embers of the fire into safety, the advance guard of the fog was
creeping slowly among the trees, like white arms feeling their way.
Mingled with the smoke was the odour of moss and soil and bark, and
the peculiar flavour of the Baltic, half salt, half brackish, like the
smell of an estuary at low water.

It is difficult to say why it seemed to me that this deep stillness
masked an intense activity; perhaps in every mood lies the suggestion
of its opposite, so that I became aware of the contrast of furious
energy, for it was like moving through the deep pause before a
thunderstorm, and I trod gently lest by breaking a twig or moving
a stone I might set the whole scene into some sort of tumultuous
movement. Actually, no doubt, it was nothing more than a result of
overstrung nerves.

There was no more question of undressing and going to bed than there
was of undressing and going to bathe. Some sense in me was alert and
expectant. I sat in my tent and waited. And at the end of half an hour
or so my waiting was justified, for the canvas suddenly shivered,
and some one tripped over the ropes that held it to the earth. John
Silence came in.

The effect of his quiet entry was singular and prophetic: it was just
as though the energy lying behind all this stillness had pressed
forward to the edge of action. This, no doubt, was merely the
quickening of my own mind, and had no other justification; for the
presence of John Silence always suggested the near possibility of
vigorous action, and, as a matter of fact, he came in with nothing more
than a nod and a significant gesture.

He sat down on a corner of my ground-sheet, and I pushed the blanket
over so that he could cover his legs. He drew the flap of the tent
after him and settled down, but hardly had he done so when the canvas
shook a second time, and in blundered Maloney.

â€œSitting in the dark?â€ he said self-consciously, pushing his head
inside, and hanging up his lantern on the ridge-pole nail. â€œI just
looked in for a smoke. I suppose----â€

He glanced round, caught the eye of Dr. Silence, and stopped. He
put his pipe back into his pocket and began to hum softly--that
under-breath humming of a nondescript melody I knew so well and had
come to hate.

Dr. Silence leaned forward, opened the lantern and blew the light out.
â€œSpeak low,â€ he said, â€œand donâ€™t strike matches. Listen for sounds
and movements about the Camp, and be ready to follow me at a momentâ€™s
notice.â€ There was light enough to distinguish our faces easily, and I
saw Maloney glance again hurriedly at both of us.

â€œIs the Camp asleep?â€ the doctor asked presently, whispering.

â€œSangree is,â€ replied the clergyman, in a voice equally low. â€œI canâ€™t
answer for the women; I think theyâ€™re sitting up.â€

â€œThatâ€™s for the best.â€ And then he added: â€œI wish the fog would thin a
bit and let the moon through; later--we may want it.â€

â€œIt is lifting now, I think,â€ Maloney whispered back. â€œItâ€™s over the
tops of the trees already.â€

I cannot say what it was in this commonplace exchange of remarks
that thrilled. Probably Maloneyâ€™s swift acquiescence in the doctorâ€™s
mood had something to do with it; for his quick obedience certainly
impressed me a good deal. But, even without that slight evidence,
it was clear that each recognised the gravity of the occasion, and
understood that sleep was impossible and sentry duty was the order of
the night.

â€œReport to me,â€ repeated John Silence once again, â€œthe least sound, and
do nothing precipitately.â€

He shifted across to the mouth of the tent and raised the flap,
fastening it against the pole so that he could see out. Maloney stopped
humming and began to force the breath through his teeth with a kind
of faint hissing, treating us to a medley of church hymns and popular
songs of the day.

Then the tent trembled as though some one had touched it.

â€œThatâ€™s the wind rising,â€ whispered the clergyman, and pulled the flap
open as far as it would go. A waft of cold damp air entered and made us
shiver, and with it came a sound of the sea as the first wave washed
its way softly along the shores.

â€œItâ€™s got round to the north,â€ he added, and following his voice came
a long-drawn whisper that rose from the whole island as the trees sent
forth a sighing response. â€œThe fogâ€™ll move a bit now. I can make out a
lane across the sea already.â€

â€œHush!â€ said Dr. Silence, for Maloneyâ€™s voice had risen above a
whisper, and we settled down again to another long period of watching
and waiting, broken only by the occasional rubbing of shoulders against
the canvas as we shifted our positions, and the increasing noise of
waves on the outer coast-line of the island. And over all whirred the
murmur of wind sweeping the tops of the trees like a great harp, and
the faint tapping on the tent as drops fell from the branches with a
sharp pinging sound.

We had sat for something over an hour in this way, and Maloney and I
were finding it increasingly hard to keep awake, when suddenly Dr.
Silence rose to his feet and peered out. The next minute he was gone.

Relieved of the dominating presence, the clergyman thrust his face
close into mine. â€œI donâ€™t much care for this waiting game,â€ he
whispered, â€œbut Silence wouldnâ€™t hear of my sitting up with the others;
he said it would prevent anything happening if I did.â€

â€œHe knows,â€ I answered shortly.

â€œNo doubt in the world about that,â€ he whispered back; â€œitâ€™s this
â€˜Doubleâ€™ business, as he calls it, or else itâ€™s obsession as the Bible
describes it. But itâ€™s bad, whichever it is, and Iâ€™ve got my Winchester
outside ready cocked, and I brought this too.â€ He shoved a pocket Bible
under my nose. At one time in his life it had been his inseparable
companion.

â€œOneâ€™s useless and the otherâ€™s dangerous,â€ I replied under my breath,
conscious of a keen desire to laugh, and leaving him to choose. â€œSafety
lies in following our leader----â€

â€œIâ€™m not thinking of myself,â€ he interrupted sharply; â€œonly, if
anything happens to Joan to-night Iâ€™m going to shoot first--and pray
afterwards!â€

Maloney put the book back into his hip-pocket, and peered out of the
doorway. â€œWhat is he up to now, in the devilâ€™s name, I wonder!â€ he
added; â€œgoing round Sangreeâ€™s tent and making gestures. How weird he
looks disappearing in and out of the fog.â€

â€œJust trust him and wait,â€ I said quickly, for the doctor was already
on his way back. â€œRemember, he has the knowledge, and knows what heâ€™s
about. Iâ€™ve been with him through worse cases than this.â€

Maloney moved back as Dr. Silence darkened the doorway and stooped to
enter.

â€œHis sleep is very deep,â€ he whispered, seating himself by the door
again. â€œHeâ€™s in a cataleptic condition, and the Double may be released
any minute now. But Iâ€™ve taken steps to imprison it in the tent, and it
canâ€™t get out till I permit it. Be on the watch for signs of movement.â€
Then he looked hard at Maloney. â€œBut no violence, or shooting,
remember, Mr. Maloney, unless you want a murder on your hands. Anything
done to the Double acts by repercussion upon the physical body. You had
better take out the cartridges at once.â€

His voice was stern. The clergyman went out, and I heard him emptying
the magazine of his rifle. When he returned he sat nearer the door than
before, and from that moment until we left the tent he never once took
his eyes from the figure of Dr. Silence, silhouetted there against sky
and canvas.

And, meanwhile, the wind came steadily over the sea and opened the mist
into lanes and clearings, driving it about like a living thing.

It must have been well after midnight when a low booming sound drew my
attention; but at first the sense of hearing was so strained that it
was impossible exactly to locate it, and I imagined it was the thunder
of big guns far out at sea carried to us by the rising wind. Then
Maloney, catching hold of my arm and leaning forward, somehow brought
the true relation, and I realised the next second that it was only a
few feet away.

â€œSangreeâ€™s tent,â€ he exclaimed in a loud and startled whisper.

I craned my head round the corner, but at first the effect of the
fog was so confusing that every patch of white driving about before
the wind looked like a moving tent and it was some seconds before I
discovered the one patch that held steady. Then I saw that it was
shaking all over, and the sides, flapping as much as the tightness of
the ropes allowed, were the cause of the booming sound we had heard.
Something alive was tearing frantically about inside, banging against
the stretched canvas in a way that made me think of a great moth
dashing against the walls and ceiling of a room. The tent bulged and
rocked.

â€œItâ€™s trying to get out, by Jupiter!â€ muttered the clergyman, rising to
his feet and turning to the side where the unloaded rifle lay. I sprang
up too, hardly knowing what purpose was in my mind, but anxious to be
prepared for anything. John Silence, however, was before us both, and
his figure slipped past and blocked the doorway of the tent. And there
was some quality in his voice next minute when he began to speak that
brought our minds instantly to a state of calm obedience.

â€œFirst--the womenâ€™s tent,â€ he said low, looking sharply at Maloney,
â€œand if I need your help, Iâ€™ll call.â€

The clergyman needed no second bidding. He dived past me and was out
in a moment. He was labouring evidently under intense excitement. I
watched him picking his way silently over the slippery ground, giving
the moving tent a wide berth, and presently disappearing among the
floating shapes of fog.

Dr. Silence turned to me. â€œYou heard those footsteps about half an hour
ago?â€ he asked significantly.

â€œI heard nothing.â€

â€œThey were extraordinarily soft--almost the soundless tread of a wild
creature. But now, follow me closely,â€ he added, â€œfor we must waste
no time if I am to save this poor man from his affliction and lead
his werewolf Double to its rest. And, unless I am much mistakenâ€--he
peered at me through the darkness, whispering with the utmost
distinctness--â€œJoan and Sangree are absolutely made for one another.
And I think she knows it too--just as well as he does.â€

My head swam a little as I listened, but at the same time something
cleared in my brain and I saw that he was right. Yet it was all so
weird and incredible, so remote from the commonplace facts of life
as commonplace people know them; and more than once it flashed upon
me that the whole scene--people, words, tents, and all the rest of
it--were delusions created by the intense excitement of my own mind
somehow, and that suddenly the sea-fog would clear off and the world
become normal again.

The cold air from the sea stung our cheeks sharply as we left the close
atmosphere of the little crowded tent. The sighing of the trees, the
waves breaking below on the rocks, and the lines and patches of mist
driving about us seemed to create the momentary illusion that the whole
island had broken loose and was floating out to sea like a mighty raft.

The doctor moved just ahead of me, quickly and silently; he was making
straight for the Canadianâ€™s tent where the sides still boomed and shook
as the creature of sinister life raced and tore about impatiently
within. A little distance from the door he paused and held up a hand to
stop me. We were, perhaps, a dozen feet away.

â€œBefore I release it, you shall see for yourself,â€ he said, â€œthat the
reality of the werewolf is beyond all question. The matter of which
it is composed is, of course, exceedingly attenuated, but you are
partially clairvoyant--and even if it is not dense enough for normal
sight you will see something.â€

He added a little more I could not catch. The fact was that the
curiously strong vibrating atmosphere surrounding his person somewhat
confused my senses. It was the result, of course, of his intense
concentration of mind and forces, and pervaded the entire Camp and all
the persons in it. And as I watched the canvas shake and heard it boom
and flap I heartily welcomed it. For it was also protective.

At the back of Sangreeâ€™s tent stood a thin group of pine trees, but
in front and at the sides the ground was comparatively clear. The
flap was wide open and any ordinary animal would have been out and
away without the least trouble. Dr. Silence led me up to within a few
feet, evidently careful not to advance beyond a certain limit, and then
stooped down and signalled to me to do the same. And looking over his
shoulder I saw the interior lit faintly by the spectral light reflected
from the fog, and the dim blot upon the balsam boughs and blankets
signifying Sangree; while over him, and round him, and up and down him,
flew the dark mass of â€œsomethingâ€ on four legs, with pointed muzzle and
sharp ears plainly visible against the tent sides, and the occasional
gleam of fiery eyes and white fangs.

I held my breath and kept utterly still, inwardly and outwardly,
for fear, I suppose, that the creature would become conscious of my
presence; but the distress I felt went far deeper than the mere sense
of personal safety, or the fact of watching something so incredibly
active and real. I became keenly aware of the dreadful psychic calamity
it involved. The realisation that Sangree lay confined in that narrow
space with this species of monstrous projection of himself--that he was
wrapped there in the cataleptic sleep, all unconscious that this thing
was masquerading with his own life and energies--added a distressing
touch of horror to the scene. In all the cases of John Silence--and
they were many and often terrible--no other psychic affliction has
ever, before or since, impressed me so convincingly with the pathetic
impermanence of the human personality, with its fluid nature, and with
the alarming possibilities of its transformations.

â€œCome,â€ he whispered, after we had watched for some minutes the frantic
efforts to escape from the circle of thought and will that held it
prisoner, â€œcome a little farther away while I release it.â€

We moved back a dozen yards or so. It was like a scene in some
impossible play, or in some ghastly and oppressive nightmare from which
I should presently awake to find the blankets all heaped up upon my
chest.

By some method undoubtedly mental, but which, in my confusion and
excitement, I failed to understand, the doctor accomplished his
purpose, and the next minute I heard him say sharply under his breath,
â€œItâ€™s out! Now, watch!â€

At this very moment a sudden gust from the sea blew aside the mist, so
that a lane opened to the sky, and the moon, ghastly and unnatural as
the effect of stage limelight, dropped down in a momentary gleam upon
the door of Sangreeâ€™s tent, and I perceived that something had moved
forward from the interior darkness and stood clearly defined upon the
threshold. And, at the same moment, the tent ceased its shuddering and
held still.

There, in the doorway, stood an animal, with neck and muzzle thrust
forward, its head poking into the night, its whole body poised in that
attitude of intense rigidity that precedes the spring into freedom,
the running leap of attack. It seemed to be about the size of a calf,
leaner than a mastiff, yet more squat than a wolf, and I can swear that
I saw the fur ridged sharply upon its back. Then its upper lip slowly
lifted, and I saw the whiteness of its teeth.

Surely no human being ever stared as hard as I did in those next few
minutes. Yet, the harder I stared the clearer appeared the amazing and
monstrous apparition. For, after all, it was Sangree--and yet it was
not Sangree. It was the head and face of an animal, and yet it was the
face of Sangree: the face of a wild dog, a wolf, and yet his face. The
eyes were sharper, narrower, more fiery, yet they were his eyes--his
eyes run wild; the teeth were longer, whiter, more pointed--yet they
were his teeth, his teeth grown cruel; the expression was flaming,
terrible, exultant--yet it was his expression carried to the border of
savagery--his expression as I had already surprised it more than once,
only dominant now, fully released from human constraint, with the mad
yearning of a hungry and importunate soul. It was the soul of Sangree,
the long suppressed, deeply loving Sangree, expressed in its single and
intense desire--pure utterly and utterly wonderful.

Yet, at the same time, came the feeling that it was all an illusion.
I suddenly remembered the extraordinary changes the human face can
undergo in circular insanity, when it changes from melancholia to
elation; and I recalled the effect of hascheesh, which shows the human
countenance in the form of the bird or animal to which in character
it most approximates; and for a moment I attributed this mingling of
Sangreeâ€™s face with a wolf to some kind of similar delusion of the
senses. I was mad, deluded, dreaming! The excitement of the day, and
this dim light of stars and bewildering mist combined to trick me. I
had been amazingly imposed upon by some false wizardry of the senses.
It was all absurd and fantastic; it would pass.

And then, sounding across this sea of mental confusion like a bell
through a fog, came the voice of John Silence bringing me back to a
consciousness of the reality of it all--

â€œSangree--in his Double!â€

And when I looked again more calmly, I plainly saw that it was indeed
the face of the Canadian, but his face turned animal, yet mingled with
the brute expression a curiously pathetic look like the soul seen
sometimes in the yearning eyes of a dog,--the face of an animal shot
with vivid streaks of the human.

The doctor called to him softly under his breath--

â€œSangree! Sangree, you poor afflicted creature! Do you know me? Can you
understand what it is youâ€™re doing in your â€˜Body of Desireâ€™?â€

For the first time since its appearance the creature moved. Its ears
twitched and it shifted the weight of its body on to the hind legs.
Then, lifting its head and muzzle to the sky, it opened its long jaws
and gave vent to a dismal and prolonged howling.

But, when I heard that howling rise to heaven, the breath caught and
strangled in my throat and it seemed that my heart missed a beat; for,
though the sound was entirely animal, it was at the same time entirely
human. But, more than that, it was the cry I had so often heard in the
Western States of America where the Indians still fight and hunt and
struggle--it was the cry of the Redskin!

â€œThe Indian blood!â€ whispered John Silence, when I caught his arm for
support; â€œthe ancestral cry.â€

And that poignant, beseeching cry, that broken human voice, mingling
with the savage howl of the brute beast, pierced straight to my
very heart and touched there something that no music, no voice,
passionate or tender, of man, woman or child has ever stirred before
or since for one second into life. It echoed away among the fog and
the trees and lost itself somewhere out over the hidden sea. And some
part of myself--something that was far more than the mere act of
intense listening--went out with it, and for several minutes I lost
consciousness of my surroundings and felt utterly absorbed in the pain
of another stricken fellow-creature.

Again the voice of John Silence recalled me to myself.

â€œHark!â€ he said aloud. â€œHark!â€

His tone galvanised me afresh. We stood listening side by side.

Far across the island, faintly sounding through the trees and
brushwood, came a similar, answering cry. Shrill, yet wonderfully
musical, shaking the heart with a singular wild sweetness that defies
description, we heard it rise and fall upon the night air.

â€œItâ€™s across the lagoon,â€ Dr. Silence cried, but this time in full
tones that paid no tribute to caution. â€œItâ€™s Joan! Sheâ€™s answering him!â€

Again the wonderful cry rose and fell, and that same instant the animal
lowered its head, and, muzzle to earth, set off on a swift easy canter
that took it off into the mist and out of our sight like a thing of
wind and vision.

The doctor made a quick dash to the door of Sangreeâ€™s tent, and,
following close at his heels, I peered in and caught a momentary
glimpse of the small, shrunken body lying upon the branches but half
covered by the blankets--the cage from which most of the life, and not
a little of the actual corporeal substance, had escaped into that other
form of life and energy, the body of passion and desire.

By another of those swift, incalculable processes which at this stage
of my apprenticeship I failed often to grasp, Dr. Silence reclosed the
circle about the tent and body.

â€œNow it cannot return till I permit it,â€ he said, and the next second
was off at full speed into the woods, with myself close behind him.
I had already had some experience of my companionâ€™s ability to run
swiftly through a dense wood, and I now had the further proof of his
power almost to see in the dark. For, once we left the open space
about the tents, the trees seemed to absorb all the remaining vestiges
of light, and I understood that special sensibility that is said to
develop in the blind--the sense of obstacles.

And twice as we ran we heard the sound of that dismal howling drawing
nearer and nearer to the answering faint cry from the point of the
island whither we were going.

Then, suddenly, the trees fell away, and we emerged, hot and
breathless, upon the rocky point where the granite slabs ran bare into
the sea. It was like passing into the clearness of open day. And there,
sharply defined against sea and sky, stood the figure of a human being.
It was Joan.

I at once saw that there was something about her appearance that was
singular and unusual, but it was only when we had moved quite close
that I recognised what caused it. For while the lips wore a smile that
lit the whole face with a happiness I had never seen there before, the
eyes themselves were fixed in a steady, sightless stare as though they
were lifeless and made of glass.

I made an impulsive forward movement, but Dr. Silence instantly dragged
me back.

â€œNo,â€ he cried, â€œdonâ€™t wake her!â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ I replied aloud, struggling in his grasp.

â€œSheâ€™s asleep. Itâ€™s somnambulistic. The shock might injure her
permanently.â€

I turned and peered closely into his face. He was absolutely calm. I
began to understand a little more, catching, I suppose, something of
his strong thinking.

â€œWalking in her sleep, you mean?â€

He nodded. â€œSheâ€™s on her way to meet him. From the very beginning he
must have drawn her--irresistibly.â€

â€œBut the torn tent and the wounded flesh?â€

â€œWhen she did not sleep deep enough to enter the somnambulistic trance
he missed her--he went instinctively and in all innocence to seek her
out--with the result, of course, that she woke and was terrified----â€

â€œThen in their heart of hearts they love?â€ I asked finally.

John Silence smiled his inscrutable smile: â€œProfoundly,â€ he answered,
â€œand as simply as only primitive souls can love. If only they both come
to realise it in their normal waking states his Double will cease these
nocturnal excursions. He will be cured, and at rest.â€

The words had hardly left his lips when there was a sound of rustling
branches on our left, and the very next instant the dense brushwood
parted where it was darkest and out rushed the swift form of an animal
at full gallop. The noise of feet was scarcely audible, but in that
utter stillness I heard the heavy panting breath and caught the swish
of the low bushes against its sides. It went straight towards Joan--and
as it went the girl lifted her head and turned to meet it. And the same
instant a canoe that had been creeping silently and unobserved round
the inner shore of the lagoon, emerged from the shadows and defined
itself upon the water with a figure at the middle thwart. It was
Maloney.

It was only afterwards I realised that we were invisible to him where
we stood against the dark background of trees; the figures of Joan and
the animal he saw plainly, but not Dr. Silence and myself standing just
beyond them. He stood up in the canoe and pointed with his right arm. I
saw something gleam in his hand.

â€œStand aside, Joan girl, or youâ€™ll get hit,â€ he shouted, his voice
ringing horribly through the deep stillness, and the same instant a
pistol-shot cracked out with a burst of flame and smoke, and the figure
of the animal, with one tremendous leap into the air, fell back in the
shadows and disappeared like a shape of night and fog. Instantly, then,
Joan opened her eyes, looked in a dazed fashion about her, and pressing
both hands against her heart, fell with a sharp cry into my arms that
were just in time to catch her.

And an answering cry sounded across the lagoon--thin, wailing, piteous.
It came from Sangreeâ€™s tent.

â€œFool!â€ cried Dr. Silence, â€œyouâ€™ve wounded him!â€ and before we could
move or realise quite what it meant, he was in the canoe and half-way
across the lagoon.

Some kind of similar abuse came in a torrent from my lips too--though
I cannot remember the actual words--as I cursed the man for his
disobedience and tried to make the girl comfortable on the ground. But
the clergyman was more practical. He was spreading his coat over her
and dashing water on her face.

â€œItâ€™s not Joan Iâ€™ve killed at any rate,â€ I heard him mutter as she
turned and opened her eyes and smiled faintly up in his face. â€œI swear
the bullet went straight.â€

Joan stared at him; she was still dazed and bewildered, and still
imagined herself with the companion of her trance. The strange lucidity
of the somnambulist still hung over her brain and mind, though
outwardly she appeared troubled and confused.

â€œWhere has he gone to? He disappeared so suddenly, crying that he was
hurt,â€ she asked, looking at her father as though she did not recognise
him. â€œAnd if theyâ€™ve done anything to him--they have done it to me
too--for he is more to me than----â€

Her words grew vaguer and vaguer as she returned slowly to her normal
waking state, and now she stopped altogether, as though suddenly aware
that she had been surprised into telling secrets. But all the way back,
as we carried her carefully through the trees, the girl smiled and
murmured Sangreeâ€™s name and asked if he was injured, until it finally
became clear to me that the wild soul of the one had called to the
wild soul of the other and in the secret depths of their beings the
call had been heard and understood. John Silence was right. In the
abyss of her heart, too deep at first for recognition, the girl loved
him, and had loved him from the very beginning. Once her normal waking
consciousness recognised the fact they would leap together like twin
flames, and his affliction would be at an end; his intense desire would
be satisfied; he would be cured.

And in Sangreeâ€™s tent Dr. Silence and I sat up for the remainder of the
night--this wonderful and haunted night that had shown us such strange
glimpses of a new heaven and a new hell--for the Canadian tossed upon
his balsam boughs with high fever in his blood, and upon each cheek a
dark and curious contusion showed, throbbing with severe pain although
the skin was not broken and there was no outward and visible sign of
blood.

â€œMaloney shot straight, you see,â€ whispered Dr. Silence to me after the
clergyman had gone to his tent, and had put Joan to sleep beside her
mother, who, by the way, had never once awakened. â€œThe bullet must have
passed clean through the face, for both cheeks are stained. Heâ€™ll wear
these marks all his life--smaller, but always there. Theyâ€™re the most
curious scars in the world, these scars transferred by repercussion
from an injured Double. Theyâ€™ll remain visible until just before his
death, and then with the withdrawal of the subtle body they will
disappear finally.â€

His words mingled in my dazed mind with the sighs of the troubled
sleeper and the crying of the wind about the tent. Nothing seemed to
paralyse my powers of realisation so much as these twin stains of
mysterious significance upon the face before me.

It was odd, too, how speedily and easily the Camp resigned itself
again to sleep and quietness, as though a stage curtain had suddenly
dropped down upon the action and concealed it; and nothing contributed
so vividly to the feeling that I had been a spectator of some kind of
visionary drama as the dramatic nature of the change in the girlâ€™s
attitude.

Yet, as a matter of fact, the change had not been so sudden and
revolutionary as appeared. Underneath, in those remoter regions
of consciousness where the emotions, unknown to their owners, do
secretly mature, and owe thence their abrupt revelation to some abrupt
psychological climax, there can be no doubt that Joanâ€™s love for the
Canadian had been growing steadily and irresistibly all the time. It
had now rushed to the surface so that she recognised it; that was all.

And it has always seemed to me that the presence of John Silence,
so potent, so quietly efficacious, produced an effect, if one may
say so, of a psychic forcing-house, and hastened incalculably the
bringing together of these two â€œwildâ€ lovers. In that sudden awakening
had occurred the very psychological climax required to reveal the
passionate emotion accumulated below. The deeper knowledge had leaped
across and transferred itself to her ordinary consciousness, and in
that shock the collision of the personalities had shaken them to the
depths and shown her the truth beyond all possibility of doubt.

â€œHeâ€™s sleeping quietly now,â€ the doctor said, interrupting my
reflections. â€œIf you will watch alone for a bit Iâ€™ll go to Maloneyâ€™s
tent and help him to arrange his thoughts.â€ He smiled in anticipation
of that â€œarrangement.â€ â€œHeâ€™ll never quite understand how a wound on the
Double can transfer itself to the physical body, but at least I can
persuade him that the less he talks and â€˜explainsâ€™ tomorrow, the sooner
the forces will run their natural course now to peace and quietness.â€

He went away softly, and with the removal of his presence Sangree,
sleeping heavily, turned over and groaned with the pain of his broken
head.

And it was in the still hour just before the dawn, when all the islands
were hushed, the wind and sea still dreaming, and the stars visible
through clearing mists, that a figure crept silently over the ridge and
reached the door of the tent where I dozed beside the sufferer, before
I was aware of its presence. The flap was cautiously lifted a few
inches and in looked--Joan.

That same instant Sangree woke and sat up on his bed of branches. He
recognised her before I could say a word, and uttered a low cry. It was
pain and joy mingled, and this time all human. And the girl too was no
longer walking in her sleep, but fully aware of what she was doing. I
was only just able to prevent him springing from his blankets.

â€œJoan, Joan!â€ he cried, and in a flash she answered him, â€œIâ€™m here--Iâ€™m
with you always now,â€ and had pushed past me into the tent and flung
herself upon his breast.

â€œI knew you would come to me in the end,â€ I heard him whisper.

â€œIt was all too big for me to understand at first,â€ she murmured, â€œand
for a long time I was frightened----â€

â€œBut not now!â€ he cried louder; â€œyou donâ€™t feel afraid now of--of
anything thatâ€™s in me----â€

â€œI fear nothing,â€ she cried, â€œnothing, nothing!â€

I led her outside again. She looked steadily into my face with eyes
shining and her whole being transformed. In some intuitive way,
surviving probably from the somnambulism, she knew or guessed as much
as I knew.

â€œYou must talk tomorrow with John Silence,â€ I said gently, leading her
towards her own tent. â€œHe understands everything.â€

I left her at the door, and as I went back softly to take up my place
of sentry again with the Canadian, I saw the first streaks of dawn
lighting up the far rim of the sea behind the distant islands.

And, as though to emphasise the eternal closeness of comedy to tragedy,
two small details rose out of the scene and impressed me so vividly
that I remember them to this very day. For in the tent where I had
just left Joan, all aquiver with her new happiness, there rose plainly
to my ears the grotesque sounds of the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate heavily snoring,
oblivious of all things in heaven or hell; and from Maloneyâ€™s tent, so
still was the night, where I looked across and saw the lanternâ€™s glow,
there came to me, through the trees, the monotonous rising and falling
of a human voice that was beyond question the sound of a man praying to
his God.

PREFACE


Two of these stories, the third and fourth, have appeared in print in
the _Cambridge Review_, and I wish to thank the proprietor for
permitting me to republish them here.

I have had my doubts about the wisdom of publishing a third set of
tales; sequels are, not only proverbially but actually, very hazardous
things. However, the tales make no pretence but to amuse, and my
friends have not seldom asked for the publication. So not a great deal
is risked, perhaps, and perhaps also some one's Christmas may be the
cheerfuller for a storybook which, I think, only once mentions the
war.

THE RESIDENCE AT WHITMINSTER




A Thin Ghost and Others

THE RESIDENCE AT WHITMINSTER


Dr. Ashton--Thomas Ashton, Doctor of Divinity--sat in his study,
habited in a dressing-gown, and with a silk cap on his shaven
head--his wig being for the time taken off and placed on its block on
a side table. He was a man of some fifty-five years, strongly made, of
a sanguine complexion, an angry eye, and a long upper lip. Face and
eye were lighted up at the moment when I picture him by the level ray
of an afternoon sun that shone in upon him through a tall sash window,
giving on the west. The room into which it shone was also tall, lined
with book-cases, and, where the wall showed between them, panelled. On
the table near the doctor's elbow was a green cloth, and upon it what
he would have called a silver standish--a tray with inkstands--quill
pens, a calf-bound book or two, some papers, a churchwarden pipe and
brass tobacco-box, a flask cased in plaited straw, and a liqueur
glass. The year was 1730, the month December, the hour somewhat past
three in the afternoon.

I have described in these lines pretty much all that a superficial
observer would have noted when he looked into the room. What met Dr.
Ashton's eye when he looked out of it, sitting in his leather
arm-chair? Little more than the tops of the shrubs and fruit-trees of
his garden could be seen from that point, but the red brick wall of it
was visible in almost all the length of its western side. In the
middle of that was a gate--a double gate of rather elaborate iron
scroll-work, which allowed something of a view beyond. Through it he
could see that the ground sloped away almost at once to a bottom,
along which a stream must run, and rose steeply from it on the other
side, up to a field that was park-like in character, and thickly
studded with oaks, now, of course, leafless. They did not stand so
thick together but that some glimpse of sky and horizon could be seen
between their stems. The sky was now golden and the horizon, a horizon
of distant woods, it seemed, was purple.

But all that Dr. Ashton could find to say, after contemplating this
prospect for many minutes, was: "Abominable!"

A listener would have been aware, immediately upon this, of the sound
of footsteps coming somewhat hurriedly in the direction of the study:
by the resonance he could have told that they were traversing a much
larger room. Dr. Ashton turned round in his chair as the door opened,
and looked expectant. The incomer was a lady--a stout lady in the
dress of the time: though I have made some attempt at indicating the
doctor's costume, I will not enterprise that of his wife--for it was
Mrs. Ashton who now entered. She had an anxious, even a sorely
distracted, look, and it was in a very disturbed voice that she almost
whispered to Dr. Ashton, putting her head close to his, "He's in a
very sad way, love, worse, I'm afraid." "Tt--tt, is he really?" and he
leaned back and looked in her face. She nodded. Two solemn bells, high
up, and not far away, rang out the half-hour at this moment. Mrs.
Ashton started. "Oh, do you think you can give order that the minster
clock be stopped chiming to-night? 'Tis just over his chamber, and
will keep him from sleeping, and to sleep is the only chance for him,
that's certain." "Why, to be sure, if there were need, real need, it
could be done, but not upon any light occasion. This Frank, now, do
you assure me that his recovery stands upon it?" said Dr. Ashton: his
voice was loud and rather hard. "I do verily believe it," said his
wife. "Then, if it must be, bid Molly run across to Simpkins and say
on my authority that he is to stop the clock chimes at sunset:
and--yes--she is after that to say to my lord Saul that I wish to see
him presently in this room." Mrs. Ashton hurried off.

Before any other visitor enters, it will be well to explain the
situation.

Dr. Ashton was the holder, among other preferments, of a prebend in
the rich collegiate church of Whitminster, one of the foundations
which, though not a cathedral, survived dissolution and reformation,
and retained its constitution and endowments for a hundred years after
the time of which I write. The great church, the residences of the
dean and the two prebendaries, the choir and its appurtenances, were
all intact and in working order. A dean who flourished soon after 1500
had been a great builder, and had erected a spacious quadrangle of red
brick adjoining the church for the residence of the officials. Some of
these persons were no longer required: their offices had dwindled
down to mere titles, borne by clergy or lawyers in the town and
neighbourhood; and so the houses that had been meant to accommodate
eight or ten people were now shared among three, the dean and the two
prebendaries. Dr. Ashton's included what had been the common parlour
and the dining-hall of the whole body. It occupied a whole side of the
court, and at one end had a private door into the minster. The other
end, as we have seen, looked out over the country.

So much for the house. As for the inmates, Dr. Ashton was a wealthy
man and childless, and he had adopted, or rather undertaken to bring
up, the orphan son of his wife's sister. Frank Sydall was the lad's
name: he had been a good many months in the house. Then one day came a
letter from an Irish peer, the Earl of Kildonan (who had known Dr.
Ashton at college), putting it to the doctor whether he would consider
taking into his family the Viscount Saul, the Earl's heir, and acting
in some sort as his tutor. Lord Kildonan was shortly to take up a post
in the Lisbon Embassy, and the boy was unfit to make the voyage: "not
that he is sickly," the Earl wrote, "though you'll find him whimsical,
or of late I've thought him so, and to confirm this, 'twas only
to-day his old nurse came expressly to tell me he was possess'd: but
let that pass; I'll warrant you can find a spell to make all straight.
Your arm was stout enough in old days, and I give you plenary
authority to use it as you see fit. The truth is, he has here no boys
of his age or quality to consort with, and is given to moping about in
our raths and graveyards: and he brings home romances that fright my
servants out of their wits. So there are you and your lady
forewarned." It was perhaps with half an eye open to the possibility
of an Irish bishopric (at which another sentence in the Earl's letter
seemed to hint) that Dr. Ashton accepted the charge of my Lord
Viscount Saul and of the 200 guineas a year that were to come with
him.

So he came, one night in September. When he got out of the chaise that
brought him, he went first and spoke to the postboy and gave him some
money, and patted the neck of his horse. Whether he made some movement
that scared it or not, there was very nearly a nasty accident, for the
beast started violently, and the postilion being unready was thrown
and lost his fee, as he found afterwards, and the chaise lost some
paint on the gateposts, and the wheel went over the man's foot who was
taking out the baggage. When Lord Saul came up the steps into the
light of the lamp in the porch to be greeted by Dr. Ashton, he was
seen to be a thin youth of, say, sixteen years old, with straight
black hair and the pale colouring that is common to such a figure. He
took the accident and commotion calmly enough, and expressed a proper
anxiety for the people who had been, or might have been, hurt: his
voice was smooth and pleasant, and without any trace, curiously, of an
Irish brogue.

Frank Sydall was a younger boy, perhaps of eleven or twelve, but Lord
Saul did not for that reject his company. Frank was able to teach him
various games he had not known in Ireland, and he was apt at learning
them; apt, too, at his books, though he had had little or no regular
teaching at home. It was not long before he was making a shift to
puzzle out the inscriptions on the tombs in the minster, and he would
often put a question to the doctor about the old books in the library
that required some thought to answer. It is to be supposed that he
made himself very agreeable to the servants, for within ten days of
his coming they were almost falling over each other in their efforts
to oblige him. At the same time, Mrs. Ashton was rather put to it to
find new maidservants; for there were several changes, and some of the
families in the town from which she had been accustomed to draw seemed
to have no one available. She was forced to go further afield than was
usual.

These generalities I gather from the doctor's notes in his diary and
from letters. They are generalities, and we should like, in view of
what has to be told, something sharper and more detailed. We get it in
entries which begin late in the year, and, I think, were posted up all
together after the final incident; but they cover so few days in all
that there is no need to doubt that the writer could remember the
course of things accurately.

On a Friday morning it was that a fox, or perhaps a cat, made away
with Mrs. Ashton's most prized black cockerel, a bird without a single
white feather on its body. Her husband had told her often enough that
it would make a suitable sacrifice to Ã†sculapius; that had discomfited
her much, and now she would hardly be consoled. The boys looked
everywhere for traces of it: Lord Saul brought in a few feathers,
which seemed to have been partially burnt on the garden rubbish-heap.
It was on the same day that Dr. Ashton, looking out of an upper
window, saw the two boys playing in the corner of the garden at a game
he did not understand. Frank was looking earnestly at something in the
palm of his hand. Saul stood behind him and seemed to be listening.
After some minutes he very gently laid his hand on Frank's head, and
almost instantly thereupon, Frank suddenly dropped whatever it was
that he was holding, clapped his hands to his eyes, and sank down on
the grass. Saul, whose face expressed great anger, hastily picked the
object up, of which it could only be seen that it was glittering, put
it in his pocket, and turned away, leaving Frank huddled up on the
grass. Dr. Ashton rapped on the window to attract their attention, and
Saul looked up as if in alarm, and then springing to Frank, pulled him
up by the arm and led him away. When they came in to dinner, Saul
explained that they had been acting a part of the tragedy of
Radamistus, in which the heroine reads the future fate of her father's
kingdom by means of a glass ball held in her hand, and is overcome by
the terrible events she has seen. During this explanation Frank said
nothing, only looked rather bewilderedly at Saul. He must, Mrs. Ashton
thought, have contracted a chill from the wet of the grass, for that
evening he was certainly feverish and disordered; and the disorder was
of the mind as well as the body, for he seemed to have something he
wished to say to Mrs. Ashton, only a press of household affairs
prevented her from paying attention to him; and when she went,
according to her habit, to see that the light in the boys' chamber had
been taken away, and to bid them good-night, he seemed to be sleeping,
though his face was unnaturally flushed, to her thinking: Lord Saul,
however, was pale and quiet, and smiling in his slumber.

Next morning it happened that Dr. Ashton was occupied in church and
other business, and unable to take the boys' lessons. He therefore set
them tasks to be written and brought to him. Three times, if not
oftener, Frank knocked at the study door, and each time the doctor
chanced to be engaged with some visitor, and sent the boy off rather
roughly, which he later regretted. Two clergymen were at dinner this
day, and both remarked--being fathers of families--that the lad seemed
sickening for a fever, in which they were too near the truth, and it
had been better if he had been put to bed forthwith: for a couple of
hours later in the afternoon he came running into the house, crying
out in a way that was really terrifying, and rushing to Mrs. Ashton,
clung about her, begging her to protect him, and saying, "Keep them
off! keep them off!" without intermission. And it was now evident that
some sickness had taken strong hold of him. He was therefore got to
bed in another chamber from that in which he commonly lay, and the
physician brought to him: who pronounced the disorder to be grave and
affecting the lad's brain, and prognosticated a fatal end to it if
strict quiet were not observed, and those sedative remedies used which
he should prescribe.

We are now come by another way to the point we had reached before. The
minster clock has been stopped from striking, and Lord Saul is on the
threshold of the study.

"What account can you give of this poor lad's state?" was Dr. Ashton's
first question. "Why, sir, little more than you know already, I fancy.
I must blame myself, though, for giving him a fright yesterday when we
were acting that foolish play you saw. I fear I made him take it more
to heart than I meant." "How so?" "Well, by telling him foolish tales
I had picked up in Ireland of what we call the second sight."
"_Second_ sight! What kind of sight might that be?" "Why, you know our
ignorant people pretend that some are able to foresee what is to
come--sometimes in a glass, or in the air, maybe, and at Kildonan we
had an old woman that pretended to such a power. And I daresay I
coloured the matter more highly than I should: but I never dreamed
Frank would take it so near as he did." "You were wrong, my lord, very
wrong, in meddling with such superstitious matters at all, and you
should have considered whose house you were in, and how little
becoming such actions are to my character and person or to your own:
but pray how came it that you, acting, as you say, a play, should fall
upon anything that could so alarm Frank?" "That is what I can hardly
tell, sir: he passed all in a moment from rant about battles and
lovers and Cleodora and Antigenes to something I could not follow at
all, and then dropped down as you saw." "Yes: was that at the moment
when you laid your hand on the top of his head?" Lord Saul gave a
quick look at his questioner--quick and spiteful--and for the first
time seemed unready with an answer. "About that time it may have
been," he said. "I have tried to recollect myself, but I am not sure.
There was, at any rate, no significance in what I did then." "Ah!"
said Dr. Ashton, "well, my lord, I should do wrong were I not to tell
you that this fright of my poor nephew may have very ill consequences
to him. The doctor speaks very despondingly of his state." Lord Saul
pressed his hands together and looked earnestly upon Dr. Ashton. "I am
willing to believe you had no bad intention, as assuredly you could
have no reason to bear the poor boy malice: but I cannot wholly free
you from blame in the affair." As he spoke, the hurrying steps were
heard again, and Mrs. Ashton came quickly into the room, carrying a
candle, for the evening had by this time closed in. She was greatly
agitated. "O come!" she cried, "come directly. I'm sure he is going."
"Going? Frank? Is it possible? Already?" With some such incoherent
words the doctor caught up a book of prayers from the table and ran
out after his wife. Lord Saul stopped for a moment where he was.
Molly, the maid, saw him bend over and put both hands to his face. If
it were the last words she had to speak, she said afterwards, he was
striving to keep back a fit of laughing. Then he went out softly,
following the others.

Mrs. Ashton was sadly right in her forecast. I have no inclination to
imagine the last scene in detail. What Dr. Ashton records is, or may
be taken to be, important to the story. They asked Frank if he would
like to see his companion, Lord Saul, once again. The boy was quite
collected, it appears, in these moments. "No," he said, "I do not want
to see him; but you should tell him I am afraid he will be very cold."
"What do you mean, my dear?" said Mrs. Ashton. "Only that;" said
Frank, "but say to him besides that I am free of them now, but he
should take care. And I am sorry about your black cockerel, Aunt
Ashton; but he said we must use it so, if we were to see all that
could be seen."

Not many minutes after, he was gone. Both the Ashtons were grieved,
she naturally most; but the doctor, though not an emotional man, felt
the pathos of the early death: and, besides, there was the growing
suspicion that all had not been told him by Saul, and that there was
something here which was out of his beaten track. When he left the
chamber of death, it was to walk across the quadrangle of the
residence to the sexton's house. A passing bell, the greatest of the
minster bells, must be rung, a grave must be dug in the minster yard,
and there was now no need to silence the chiming of the minster clock.
As he came slowly back in the dark, he thought he must see Lord Saul
again. That matter of the black cockerel--trifling as it might
seem--would have to be cleared up. It might be merely a fancy of the
sick boy, but if not, was there not a witch-trial he had read, in
which some grim little rite of sacrifice had played a part? Yes, he
must see Saul.

I rather guess these thoughts of his than find written authority for
them. That there was another interview is certain: certain also that
Saul would (or, as he said, could) throw no light on Frank's words:
though the message, or some part of it, appeared to affect him
horribly. But there is no record of the talk in detail. It is only
said that Saul sat all that evening in the study, and when he bid
good-night, which he did most reluctantly, asked for the doctor's
prayers.

The month of January was near its end when Lord Kildonan, in the
Embassy at Lisbon, received a letter that for once gravely disturbed
that vain man and neglectful father. Saul was dead. The scene at
Frank's burial had been very distressing. The day was awful in
blackness and wind: the bearers, staggering blindly along under the
flapping black pall, found it a hard job, when they emerged from the
porch of the minster, to make their way to the grave. Mrs. Ashton was
in her room--women did not then go to their kinsfolk's funerals--but
Saul was there, draped in the mourning cloak of the time, and his face
was white and fixed as that of one dead, except when, as was noticed
three or four times, he suddenly turned his head to the left and
looked over his shoulder. It was then alive with a terrible expression
of listening fear. No one saw him go away: and no one could find him
that evening. All night the gale buffeted the high windows of the
church, and howled over the upland and roared through the woodland. It
was useless to search in the open: no voice of shouting or cry for
help could possibly be heard. All that Dr. Ashton could do was to warn
the people about the college, and the town constables, and to sit up,
on the alert for any news, and this he did. News came early next
morning, brought by the sexton, whose business it was to open the
church for early prayers at seven, and who sent the maid rushing
upstairs with wild eyes and flying hair to summon her master. The two
men dashed across to the south door of the minster, there to find Lord
Saul clinging desperately to the great ring of the door, his head sunk
between his shoulders, his stockings in rags, his shoes gone, his legs
torn and bloody.

This was what had to be told to Lord Kildonan, and this really ends
the first part of the story. The tomb of Frank Sydall and of the Lord
Viscount Saul, only child and heir to William Earl of Kildonan, is
one: a stone altar tomb in Whitminster churchyard.

Dr. Ashton lived on for over thirty years in his prebendal house, I do
not know how quietly, but without visible disturbance. His successor
preferred a house he already owned in the town, and left that of the
senior prebendary vacant. Between them these two men saw the
eighteenth century out and the nineteenth in; for Mr. Hindes, the
successor of Ashton, became prebendary at nine-and-twenty and died at
nine-and-eighty. So that it was not till 1823 or 1824 that any one
succeeded to the post who intended to make the house his home. The man
who did was Dr. Henry Oldys, whose name may be known to some of my
readers as that of the author of a row of volumes labelled _Oldys's
Works_, which occupy a place that must be honoured, since it is so
rarely touched, upon the shelves of many a substantial library.

Dr. Oldys, his niece, and his servants took some months to transfer
furniture and books from his Dorsetshire parsonage to the quadrangle
of Whitminster, and to get everything into place. But eventually the
work was done, and the house (which, though untenanted, had always
been kept sound and weather-tight) woke up, and like Monte Cristo's
mansion at Auteuil, lived, sang, and bloomed once more. On a certain
morning in June it looked especially fair, as Dr. Oldys strolled in
his garden before breakfast and gazed over the red roof at the minster
tower with its four gold vanes, backed by a very blue sky, and very
white little clouds.

"Mary," he said, as he seated himself at the breakfast table and laid
down something hard and shiny on the cloth, "here's a find which the
boy made just now. You'll be sharper than I if you can guess what it's
meant for." It was a round and perfectly smooth tablet--as much as an
inch thick--of what seemed clear glass. "It is rather attractive at
all events," said Mary: she was a fair woman, with light hair and
large eyes, rather a devotee of literature. "Yes," said her uncle, "I
thought you'd be pleased with it. I presume it came from the house: it
turned up in the rubbish-heap in the corner." "I'm not sure that I do
like it, after all," said Mary, some minutes later. "Why in the world
not, my dear?" "I don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps it's only fancy."
"Yes, only fancy and romance, of course. What's that book, now--the
name of that book, I mean, that you had your head in all yesterday?"
"_The Talisman_, Uncle. Oh, if this should turn out to be a talisman,
how enchanting it would be!" "Yes, _The Talisman_: ah, well, you're
welcome to it, whatever it is: I must be off about my business. Is all
well in the house? Does it suit you? Any complaints from the servants'
hall?" "No, indeed, nothing could be more charming. The only _soupÃ§on_
of a complaint besides the lock of the linen closet, which I told you
of, is that Mrs. Maple says she cannot get rid of the sawflies out of
that room you pass through at the other end of the hall. By the way,
are you sure you like your bedroom? It is a long way off from any one
else, you know." "Like it? To be sure I do; the further off from you,
my dear, the better. There, don't think it necessary to beat me:
accept my apologies. But what are sawflies? will they eat my coats? If
not, they may have the room to themselves for what I care. We are not
likely to be using it." "No, of course not. Well, what she calls
sawflies are those reddish things like a daddy-longlegs, but
smaller,[1] and there are a great many of them perching about that
room, certainly. I don't like them, but I don't fancy they are
mischievous." "There seem to be several things you don't like this
fine morning," said her uncle, as he closed the door. Miss Oldys
remained in her chair looking at the tablet, which she was holding in
the palm of her hand. The smile that had been on her face faded slowly
from it and gave place to an expression of curiosity and almost
strained attention. Her reverie was broken by the entrance of Mrs.
Maple, and her invariable opening, "Oh, Miss, could I speak to you a
minute?"

A letter from Miss Oldys to a friend in Lichfield, begun a day or two
before, is the next source for this story. It is not devoid of traces
of the influence of that leader of female thought in her day, Miss
Anna Seward, known to some as the Swan of Lichfield.

"My sweetest Emily will be rejoiced to hear that we are at length--my
beloved uncle and myself--settled in the house that now calls us
master--nay, master and mistress--as in past ages it has called so
many others. Here we taste a mingling of modern elegance and hoary
antiquity, such as has never ere now graced life for either of us. The
town, small as it is, affords us some reflection, pale indeed, but
veritable, of the sweets of polite intercourse: the adjacent country
numbers amid the occupants of its scattered mansions some whose polish
is annually refreshed by contact with metropolitan splendour, and
others whose robust and homely geniality is, at times, and by way of
contrast, not less cheering and acceptable. Tired of the parlours and
drawing-rooms of our friends, we have ready to hand a refuge from the
clash of wits or the small talk of the day amid the solemn beauties of
our venerable minster, whose silvern chimes daily 'knoll us to
prayer,' and in the shady walks of whose tranquil graveyard we muse
with softened heart, and ever and anon with moistened eye, upon the
memorials of the young, the beautiful, the aged, the wise, and the
good."

Here there is an abrupt break both in the writing and the style.

"But my dearest Emily, I can no longer write with the care which you
deserve, and in which we both take pleasure. What I have to tell you
is wholly foreign to what has gone before. This morning my uncle
brought in to breakfast an object which had been found in the garden;
it was a glass or crystal tablet of this shape (a little sketch is
given), which he handed to me, and which, after he left the room,
remained on the table by me. I gazed at it, I know not why, for some
minutes, till called away by the day's duties; and you will smile
incredulously when I say that I seemed to myself to begin to descry
reflected in it objects and scenes which were not in the room where I
was. You will not, however, be surprised that after such an experience
I took the first opportunity to seclude myself in my room with what I
now half believed to be a talisman of mickle might. I was not
disappointed. I assure you, Emily, by that memory which is dearest to
both of us, that what I went through this afternoon transcends the
limits of what I had before deemed credible. In brief, what I saw,
seated in my bedroom, in the broad daylight of summer, and looking
into the crystal depth of that small round tablet, was this. First, a
prospect, strange to me, of an enclosure of rough and hillocky grass,
with a grey stone ruin in the midst, and a wall of rough stones about
it. In this stood an old, and very ugly, woman in a red cloak and
ragged skirt, talking to a boy dressed in the fashion of maybe a
hundred years ago. She put something which glittered into his hand,
and he something into hers, which I saw to be money, for a single coin
fell from her trembling hand into the grass. The scene passed--I
should have remarked, by the way, that on the rough walls of the
enclosure I could distinguish bones, and even a skull, lying in a
disorderly fashion. Next, I was looking upon two boys; one the figure
of the former vision, the other younger. They were in a plot of
garden, walled round, and this garden, in spite of the difference in
arrangement, and the small size of the trees, I could clearly
recognize as being that upon which I now look from my window. The boys
were engaged in some curious play, it seemed. Something was
smouldering on the ground. The elder placed his hands upon it, and
then raised them in what I took to be an attitude of prayer: and I
saw, and started at seeing, that on them were deep stains of blood.
The sky above was overcast. The same boy now turned his face towards
the wall of the garden, and beckoned with both his raised hands, and
as he did so I was conscious that some moving objects were becoming
visible over the top of the wall--whether heads or other parts of some
animal or human forms I could not tell. Upon the instant the elder boy
turned sharply, seized the arm of the younger (who all this time had
been poring over what lay on the ground), and both hurried off. I then
saw blood upon the grass, a little pile of bricks, and what I thought
were black feathers scattered about. That scene closed, and the next
was so dark that perhaps the full meaning of it escaped me. But what I
seemed to see was a form, at first crouching low among trees or bushes
that were being threshed by a violent wind, then running very swiftly,
and constantly turning a pale face to look behind him, as if he feared
a pursuer: and, indeed, pursuers were following hard after him. Their
shapes were but dimly seen, their number--three or four, perhaps,
only guessed. I suppose they were on the whole more like dogs than
anything else, but dogs such as we have seen they assuredly were not.
Could I have closed my eyes to this horror, I would have done so at
once, but I was helpless. The last I saw was the victim darting
beneath an arch and clutching at some object to which he clung: and
those that were pursuing him overtook him, and I seemed to hear the
echo of a cry of despair. It may be that I became unconscious:
certainly I had the sensation of awaking to the light of day after an
interval of darkness. Such, in literal truth, Emily, was my vision--I
can call it by no other name--of this afternoon. Tell me, have I not
been the unwilling witness of some episode of a tragedy connected with
this very house?"

The letter is continued next day. "The tale of yesterday was not
completed when I laid down my pen. I said nothing of my experiences to
my uncle--you know, yourself, how little his robust common-sense would
be prepared to allow of them, and how in his eyes the specific remedy
would be a black draught or a glass of port. After a silent evening,
then--silent, not sullen--I retired to rest. Judge of my terror,
when, not yet in bed, I heard what I can only describe as a distant
bellow, and knew it for my uncle's voice, though never in my hearing
so exerted before. His sleeping-room is at the further extremity of
this large house, and to gain access to it one must traverse an
antique hall some eighty feet long and a lofty panelled chamber, and
two unoccupied bedrooms. In the second of these--a room almost devoid
of furniture--I found him, in the dark, his candle lying smashed on
the floor. As I ran in, bearing a light, he clasped me in arms that
trembled for the first time since I have known him, thanked God, and
hurried me out of the room. He would say nothing of what had alarmed
him. 'To-morrow, to-morrow,' was all I could get from him. A bed was
hastily improvised for him in the room next to my own. I doubt if his
night was more restful than mine. I could only get to sleep in the
small hours, when daylight was already strong, and then my dreams were
of the grimmest--particularly one which stamped itself on my brain,
and which I must set down on the chance of dispersing the impression
it has made. It was that I came up to my room with a heavy foreboding
of evil oppressing me, and went with a hesitation and reluctance I
could not explain to my chest of drawers. I opened the top drawer, in
which was nothing but ribbons and handkerchiefs, and then the second,
where was as little to alarm, and then, O heavens, the third and last:
and there was a mass of linen neatly folded: upon which, as I looked
with curiosity that began to be tinged with horror, I perceived a
movement in it, and a pink hand was thrust out of the folds and began
to grope feebly in the air. I could bear it no more, and rushed from
the room, clapping the door after me, and strove with all my force to
lock it. But the key would not turn in the wards, and from within the
room came a sound of rustling and bumping, drawing nearer and nearer
to the door. Why I did not flee down the stairs I know not. I
continued grasping the handle, and mercifully, as the door was plucked
from my hand with an irresistible force, I awoke. You may not think
this very alarming, but I assure you it was so to me.

"At breakfast to-day my uncle was very uncommunicative, and I think
ashamed of the fright he had given us; but afterwards he inquired of
me whether Mr. Spearman was still in town, adding that he thought that
was a young man who had some sense left in his head. I think you
know, my dear Emily, that I am not inclined to disagree with him
there, and also that I was not unlikely to be able to answer his
question. To Mr. Spearman he accordingly went, and I have not seen him
since. I must send this strange budget of news to you now, or it may
have to wait over more than one post."

The reader will not be far out if he guesses that Miss Mary and Mr.
Spearman made a match of it not very long after this month of June.
Mr. Spearman was a young spark, who had a good property in the
neighbourhood of Whitminster, and not unfrequently about this time
spent a few days at the "King's Head," ostensibly on business. But he
must have had some leisure, for his diary is copious, especially for
the days of which I am telling the story. It is probable to me that he
wrote this episode as fully as he could at the bidding of Miss Mary.

"Uncle Oldys (how I hope I may have the right to call him so before
long!) called this morning. After throwing out a good many short
remarks on indifferent topics, he said 'I wish, Spearman, you'd listen
to an odd story and keep a close tongue about it just for a bit, till
I get more light on it.' 'To be sure,' said I, 'you may count on me.'
'I don't know what to make of it,' he said. 'You know my bedroom. It
is well away from every one else's, and I pass through the great hall
and two or three other rooms to get to it.' 'Is it at the end next the
minster, then?' I asked. 'Yes, it is: well, now, yesterday morning my
Mary told me that the room next before it was infested with some sort
of fly that the housekeeper couldn't get rid of. That may be the
explanation, or it may not. What do you think?' 'Why,' said I, 'you've
not yet told me what has to be explained.' 'True enough, I don't
believe I have; but by-the-by, what are these sawflies? What's the
size of them?' I began to wonder if he was touched in the head. 'What
I call a sawfly,' I said very patiently, 'is a red animal, like a
daddy-longlegs, but not so big, perhaps an inch long, perhaps less. It
is very hard in the body, and to me'--I was going to say 'particularly
offensive,' but he broke in, 'Come, come; an inch or less. That won't
do.' 'I can only tell you,' I said, 'what I know. Would it not be
better if you told me from first to last what it is that has puzzled
you, and then I may be able to give you some kind of an opinion.' He
gazed at me meditatively. 'Perhaps it would,' he said. 'I told Mary
only to-day that I thought you had some vestiges of sense in your
head.' (I bowed my acknowledgements.) 'The thing is, I've an odd kind
of shyness about talking of it. Nothing of the sort has happened to me
before. Well, about eleven o'clock last night, or after, I took my
candle and set out for my room. I had a book in my other hand--I
always read something for a few minutes before I drop off to sleep. A
dangerous habit: I don't recommend it: but I know how to manage my
light and my bed curtains. Now then, first, as I stepped out of my
study into the great half that's next to it, and shut the door, my
candle went out. I supposed I had clapped the door behind me too
quick, and made a draught, and I was annoyed, for I'd no tinder-box
nearer than my bedroom. But I knew my way well enough, and went on.
The next thing was that my book was struck out of my hand in the dark:
if I said twitched out of my hand it would better express the
sensation. It fell on the floor. I picked it up, and went on, more
annoyed than before, and a little startled. But as you know, that hall
has many windows without curtains, and in summer nights like these it
is easy to see not only where the furniture is, but whether there's
any one or anything moving, and there was no one--nothing of the kind.
So on I went through the hall and through the audit chamber next to
it, which also has big windows, and then into the bedrooms which lead
to my own, where the curtains were drawn, and I had to go slower
because of steps here and there. It was in the second of those rooms
that I nearly got my _quietus_. The moment I opened the door of it I
felt there was something wrong. I thought twice, I confess, whether I
shouldn't turn back and find another way there is to my room rather
than go through that one. Then I was ashamed of myself, and thought
what people call better of it, though I don't know about "better" in
this case. If I was to describe my experience exactly, I should say
this: there was a dry, light, rustling sound all over the room as I
went in, and then (you remember it was perfectly dark) something
seemed to rush at me, and there was--I don't know how to put it--a
sensation of long thin arms, or legs, or feelers, all about my face,
and neck, and body. Very little strength in them, there seemed to be,
but Spearman, I don't think I was ever more horrified or disgusted in
all my life, that I remember: and it does take something to put me
out. I roared out as loud as I could, and flung away my candle at
random, and, knowing I was near the window, I tore at the curtain and
somehow let in enough light to be able to see something waving which I
knew was an insect's leg, by the shape of it: but, Lord, what a size!
Why the beast must have been as tall as I am. And now you tell me
sawflies are an inch long or less. What do you make of it, Spearman?'

"'For goodness sake finish your story first,' I said. 'I never heard
anything like it.' 'Oh,' said he, 'there's no more to tell. Mary ran
in with a light, and there was nothing there. I didn't tell her what
was the matter. I changed my room for last night, and I expect for
good.' 'Have you searched this odd room of yours?' I said. 'What do
you keep in it?' 'We don't use it,' he answered. 'There's an old press
there, and some little other furniture.' 'And in the press?' said I.
'I don't know; I never saw it opened, but I do know that it's locked.'
'Well, I should have it looked into, and, if you had time, I own to
having some curiosity to see the place myself.' 'I didn't exactly like
to ask you, but that's rather what I hoped you'd say. Name your time
and I'll take you there.' 'No time like the present,' I said at once,
for I saw he would never settle down to anything while this affair was
in suspense. He got up with great alacrity, and looked at me, I am
tempted to think, with marked approval. 'Come along,' was all he said,
however; and was pretty silent all the way to his house. My Mary (as
he calls her in public, and I in private) was summoned, and we
proceeded to the room. The Doctor had gone so far as to tell her that
he had had something of a fright there last night, of what nature he
had not yet divulged; but now he pointed out and described, very
briefly, the incidents of his progress. When we were near the
important spot, he pulled up, and allowed me to pass on. 'There's the
room,' he said. 'Go in, Spearman, and tell us what you find.' Whatever
I might have felt at midnight, noonday I was sure would keep back
anything sinister, and I flung the door open with an air and stepped
in. It was a well-lighted room, with its large window on the right,
though not, I thought, a very airy one. The principal piece of
furniture was the gaunt old press of dark wood. There was, too, a
four-post bedstead, a mere skeleton which could hide nothing, and
there was a chest of drawers. On the window-sill and the floor near it
were the dead bodies of many hundred sawflies, and one torpid one
which I had some satisfaction in killing. I tried the door of the
press, but could not open it: the drawers, too, were locked.
Somewhere, I was conscious, there was a faint rustling sound, but I
could not locate it, and when I made my report to those outside, I
said nothing of it. But, I said, clearly the next thing was to see
what was in those locked receptacles. Uncle Oldys turned to Mary.
'Mrs. Maple,' he said, and Mary ran off--no one, I am sure, steps like
her--and soon came back at a soberer pace, with an elderly lady of
discreet aspect.

"'Have you the keys of these things, Mrs. Maple?' said Uncle Oldys.
His simple words let loose a torrent (not violent, but copious) of
speech: had she been a shade or two higher in the social scale, Mrs.
Maple might have stood as the model for Miss Bates.

"'Oh, Doctor, and Miss, and you too, sir,' she said, acknowledging my
presence with a bend, 'them keys! who was that again that come when
first we took over things in this house--a gentleman in business it
was, and I gave him his luncheon in the small parlour on account of us
not having everything as we should like to see it in the large
one--chicken, and apple-pie, and a glass of madeira--dear, dear,
you'll say I'm running on, Miss Mary; but I only mention it to bring
back my recollection; and there it comes--Gardner, just the same as it
did last week with the artichokes and the text of the sermon. Now that
Mr. Gardner, every key I got from him were labelled to itself, and
each and every one was a key of some door or another in this house,
and sometimes two; and when I say door, my meaning is door of a room,
not like such a press as this is. Yes, Miss Mary, I know full well,
and I'm just making it clear to your uncle and you too, sir. But now
there _was_ a box which this same gentleman he give over into my
charge, and thinking no harm after he was gone I took the liberty,
knowing it was your uncle's property, to rattle it: and unless I'm
most surprisingly deceived, in that box there was keys, but what keys,
that, Doctor, is known Elsewhere, for open the box, no that I would
not do.'

"I wondered that Uncle Oldys remained as quiet as he did under this
address. Mary, I knew, was amused by it, and he probably had been
taught by experience that it was useless to break in upon it. At any
rate he did not, but merely said at the end, 'Have you that box handy,
Mrs. Maple? If so, you might bring it here.' Mrs. Maple pointed her
finger at him, either in accusation or in gloomy triumph. 'There,' she
said, 'was I to choose out the very words out of your mouth, Doctor,
them would be the ones. And if I've took it to my own rebuke one
half-a-dozen times, it's been nearer fifty. Laid awake I have in my
bed, sat down in my chair I have, the same you and Miss Mary gave me
the day I was twenty year in your service, and no person could desire
a better--yes, Miss Mary, but it _is_ the truth, and well we know who
it is would have it different if he could. "All very well," says I to
myself, "but pray, when the Doctor calls you to account for that box,
what are you going to say?" No, Doctor, if you was some masters I've
heard of and I was some servants I could name, I should have an easy
task before me, but things being, humanly speaking, what they are, the
one course open to me is just to say to you that without Miss Mary
comes to my room and helps me to my recollection, which her wits
_may_ manage what's slipped beyond mine, no such box as that, small
though it be, will cross your eyes this many a day to come.'

"'Why, dear Mrs. Maple, why didn't you tell me before that you wanted
me to help you to find it?' said my Mary. 'No, never mind telling me
why it was: let us come at once and look for it.' They hastened off
together. I could hear Mrs. Maple beginning an explanation which, I
doubt not, lasted into the furthest recesses of the housekeeper's
department. Uncle Oldys and I were left alone. 'A valuable servant,'
he said, nodding towards the door. 'Nothing goes wrong under her: the
speeches are seldom over three minutes.' 'How will Miss Oldys manage
to make her remember about the box?' I asked.

"'Mary? Oh, she'll make her sit down and ask her about her aunt's last
illness, or who gave her the china dog on the mantel-piece--something
quite off the point. Then, as Maple says, one thing brings up another,
and the right one will come round sooner than you could suppose.
There! I believe I hear them coming back already.'

"It was indeed so, and Mrs. Maple was hurrying on ahead of Mary with
the box in her outstretched hand, and a beaming face. 'What was it,'
she cried as she drew near, 'what was it as I said, before ever I come
out of Dorsetshire to this place? Not that I'm a Dorset woman myself,
nor had need to be. "Safe bind, safe find," and there it was in the
place where I'd put it--what?--two months back, I daresay.' She handed
it to Uncle Oldys, and he and I examined it with some interest, so
that I ceased to pay attention to Mrs. Ann Maple for the moment,
though I know that she went on to expound exactly where the box had
been, and in what way Mary had helped to refresh her memory on the
subject.

"It was an oldish box, tied with pink tape and sealed, and on the lid
was pasted a label inscribed in old ink, 'The Senior Prebendary's
House, Whitminster.' On being opened it was found to contain two keys
of moderate size, and a paper, on which, in the same hand as the
label, was 'Keys of the Press and Box of Drawers standing in the
disused Chamber.' Also this: 'The Effects in this Press and Box are
held by me, and to be held by my successors in the Residence, in trust
for the noble Family of Kildonan, if claim be made by any survivor of
it. I having made all the Enquiry possible to myself am of the
opinion that that noble House is wholly extinct: the last Earl having
been, as is notorious, cast away at sea, and his only Child and Heire
deceas'd in my House (the Papers as to which melancholy Casualty were
by me repos'd in the same Press in this year of our Lord 1753, 21
March). I am further of opinion that unless grave discomfort arise,
such persons, not being of the Family of Kildonan, as shall become
possess'd of these keys, will be well advised to leave matters as they
are: which opinion I do not express without weighty and sufficient
reason; and am Happy to have my Judgment confirm'd by the other
Members of this College and Church who are conversant with the Events
referr'd to in this Paper. Tho. Ashton, _S.T.P._, _PrÃ¦b. senr._ Will.
Blake, _S.T.P._, _Decanus_. Hen. Goodman, _S.T.B._, _PrÃ¦b. junr._'

"'Ah!' said Uncle Oldys, 'grave discomfort! So he thought there might
be something. I suspect it was that young man,' he went on, pointing
with the key to the line about the 'only Child and Heire.' 'Eh, Mary?
The viscounty of Kildonan was Saul.' 'How _do_ you know that, Uncle?'
said Mary. 'Oh, why not? it's all in Debrett--two little fat books.
But I meant the tomb by the lime walk. He's there. What's the story, I
wonder? Do you know it, Mrs. Maple? and, by the way, look at your
sawflies by the window there.'

"Mrs. Maple, thus confronted with two subjects at once, was a little
put to it to do justice to both. It was no doubt rash in Uncle Oldys
to give her the opportunity. I could only guess that he had some
slight hesitation about using the key he held in his hand.

"'Oh them flies, how bad they was, Doctor and Miss, this three or four
days: and you, too, sir, you wouldn't guess, none of you! And how they
come, too! First we took the room in hand, the shutters was up, and
had been, I daresay, years upon years, and not a fly to be seen. Then
we got the shutter bars down with a deal of trouble and left it so for
the day, and next day I sent Susan in with the broom to sweep about,
and not two minutes hadn't passed when out she come into the hall like
a blind thing, and we had regular to beat them off her. Why her cap
and her hair, you couldn't see the colour of it, I do assure you, and
all clustering round her eyes, too. Fortunate enough she's not a girl
with fancies, else if it had been me, why only the tickling of the
nasty things would have drove me out of my wits. And now there they
lay like so many dead things. Well, they was lively enough on the
Monday, and now here's Thursday, is it, or no, Friday. Only to come
near the door and you'd hear them pattering up against it, and once
you opened it, dash at you, they would, as if they'd eat you. I
couldn't help thinking to myself, "If you was bats, where should we be
this night?" Nor you can't cresh 'em, not like a usual kind of a fly.
Well, there's something to be thankful for, if we could but learn by
it. And then this tomb, too,' she said, hastening on to her second
point to elude any chance of interruption, 'of them two poor young
lads. I say poor, and yet when I recollect myself, I was at tea with
Mrs. Simpkins, the sexton's wife, before you come, Doctor and Miss
Mary, and that's a family has been in the place, what? I daresay a
hundred years in that very house, and could put their hand on any tomb
or yet grave in all the yard and give you name and age. And his
account of that young man, Mr. Simpkins's I mean to say--_well_!' She
compressed her lips and nodded several times. 'Tell us, Mrs. Maple,'
said Mary. 'Go on,' said Uncle Oldys. 'What about him?' said I.
'Never was such a thing seen in this place, not since Queen Mary's
times and the Pope and all,' said Mrs. Maple. 'Why, do you know he
lived in this very house, him and them that was with him, and for all
I can tell in this identical room' (she shifted her feet uneasily on
the floor). 'Who was with him? Do you mean the people of the house?'
said Uncle Oldys suspiciously. 'Not to call people, Doctor, dear no,'
was the answer; 'more what he brought with him from Ireland, I believe
it was. No, the people in the house was the last to hear anything of
his goings-on. But in the town not a family but knew how he stopped
out at night: and them that was with him, why they were such as would
strip the skin from the child in its grave; and a withered heart makes
an ugly thin ghost, says Mr. Simpkins. But they turned on him at the
last, he says, and there's the mark still to be seen on the minster
door where they run him down. And that's no more than the truth, for I
got him to show it to myself, and that's what he said. A lord he was,
with a Bible name of a wicked king, whatever his godfathers could have
been thinking of.' 'Saul was the name,' said Uncle Oldys. 'To be sure
it was Saul, Doctor, and thank you; and now isn't it King Saul that we
read of raising up the dead ghost that was slumbering in its tomb till
he disturbed it, and isn't that a strange thing, this young lord to
have such a name, and Mr. Simpkins's grandfather to see him out of his
window of a dark night going about from one grave to another in the
yard with a candle, and them that was with him following through the
grass at his heels: and one night him to come right up to old Mr.
Simpkins's window that gives on the yard and press his face up against
it to find out if there was any one in the room that could see him:
and only just time there was for old Mr. Simpkins to drop down like,
quiet, just under the window and hold his breath, and not stir till he
heard him stepping away again, and this rustling-like in the grass
after him as he went, and then when he looked out of his window in the
morning there was treadings in the grass and a dead man's bone. Oh, he
was a cruel child for certain, but he had to pay in the end, and
after.' 'After?' said Uncle Oldys, with a frown. 'Oh yes, Doctor,
night after night in old Mr. Simpkins's time, and his son, that's our
Mr. Simpkins's father, yes, and our own Mr. Simpkins too. Up against
that same window, particular when they've had a fire of a chilly
evening, with his face right on the panes, and his hands fluttering
out, and his mouth open and shut, open and shut, for a minute or more,
and then gone off in the dark yard. But open the window at such times,
no, that they dare not do, though they could find it in their heart to
pity the poor thing, that pinched up with the cold, and seemingly
fading away to a nothink as the years passed on. Well, indeed, I
believe it is no more than the truth what our Mr. Simpkins says on his
own grandfather's word, "A withered heart makes an ugly thin ghost."'
'I daresay,' said Uncle Oldys suddenly: so suddenly that Mrs. Maple
stopped short. 'Thank you. Come away, all of you.' 'Why, _Uncle_,'
said Mary, 'are you not going to open the press after all?' Uncle
Oldys blushed, actually blushed. 'My dear,' he said, 'you are at
liberty to call me a coward, or applaud me as a prudent man, whichever
you please. But I am neither going to open that press nor that chest
of drawers myself, nor am I going to hand over the keys to you or to
any other person. Mrs. Maple, will you kindly see about getting a man
or two to move those pieces of furniture into the garret?' 'And when
they do it, Mrs. Maple,' said Mary, who seemed to me--I did not then
know why--more relieved than disappointed by her uncle's decision, 'I
have something that I want put with the rest; only quite a small
packet.'

"We left that curious room not unwillingly, I think. Uncle Oldys's
orders were carried out that same day. And so," concludes Mr.
Spearman, "Whitminster has a Bluebeard's chamber, and, I am rather
inclined to suspect, a Jack-in-the-box, awaiting some future occupant
of the residence of the senior prebendary."

THE DIARY OF MR. POYNTER




THE DIARY OF MR. POYNTER


The sale-room of an old and famous firm of book auctioneers in London
is, of course, a great meeting-place for collectors, librarians,
dealers: not only when an auction is in progress, but perhaps even
more notably when books that are coming on for sale are upon view. It
was in such a sale-room that the remarkable series of events began
which were detailed to me not many months ago by the person whom they
principally affected, namely, Mr. James Denton, M.A., F.S.A., etc.,
etc., some time of Trinity Hall, now, or lately, of Rendcomb Manor in
the county of Warwick.

He, on a certain spring day not many years since, was in London for a
few days upon business connected principally with the furnishing of
the house which he had just finished building at Rendcomb. It may be a
disappointment to you to learn that Rendcomb Manor was new; that I
cannot help. There had, no doubt, been an old house; but it was not
remarkable for beauty or interest. Even had it been, neither beauty
nor interest would have enabled it to resist the disastrous fire which
about a couple of years before the date of my story had razed it to
the ground. I am glad to say that all that was most valuable in it had
been saved, and that it was fully insured. So that it was with a
comparatively light heart that Mr. Denton was able to face the task of
building a new and considerably more convenient dwelling for himself
and his aunt who constituted his whole _mÃ©nage_.

Being in London, with time on his hands, and not far from the
sale-room at which I have obscurely hinted, Mr. Denton thought that he
would spend an hour there upon the chance of finding, among that
portion of the famous Thomas collection of MSS., which he knew to be
then on view, something bearing upon the history or topography of his
part of Warwickshire.

He turned in accordingly, purchased a catalogue and ascended to the
sale-room, where, as usual, the books were disposed in cases and some
laid out upon the long tables. At the shelves, or sitting about at the
tables, were figures, many of whom were familiar to him. He exchanged
nods and greetings with several, and then settled down to examine his
catalogue and note likely items. He had made good progress through
about two hundred of the five hundred lots--every now and then rising
to take a volume from the shelf and give it a cursory glance--when a
hand was laid on his shoulder, and he looked up. His interrupter was
one of those intelligent men with a pointed beard and a flannel shirt,
of whom the last quarter of the nineteenth century was, it seems to
me, very prolific.

It is no part of my plan to repeat the whole conversation which ensued
between the two. I must content myself with stating that it largely
referred to common acquaintances, e.g., to the nephew of Mr. Denton's
friend who had recently married and settled in Chelsea, to the
sister-in-law of Mr. Denton's friend who had been seriously
indisposed, but was now better, and to a piece of china which Mr.
Denton's friend had purchased some months before at a price much below
its true value. From which you will rightly infer that the
conversation was rather in the nature of a monologue. In due time,
however, the friend bethought himself that Mr. Denton was there for a
purpose, and said he, "What are you looking out for in particular? I
don't think there's much in this lot." "Why, I thought there might be
some Warwickshire collections, but I don't see anything under Warwick
in the catalogue." "No, apparently not," said the friend. "All the
same, I believe I noticed something like a Warwickshire diary. What
was the name again? Drayton? Potter? Painter--either a P or a D, I
feel sure." He turned over the leaves quickly. "Yes, here it is.
Poynter. Lot 486. That might interest you. There are the books, I
think: out on the table. Some one has been looking at them. Well, I
must be getting on. Good-bye, you'll look us up, won't you? Couldn't
you come this afternoon? we've got a little music about four. Well,
then, when you're next in town." He went off. Mr. Denton looked at his
watch and found to his confusion that he could spare no more than a
moment before retrieving his luggage and going for the train. The
moment was just enough to show him that there were four largish
volumes of the diary--that it concerned the years about 1710, and that
there seemed to be a good many insertions in it of various kinds. It
seemed quite worth while to leave a commission of five and twenty
pounds for it, and this he was able to do, for his usual agent entered
the room as he was on the point of leaving it.

That evening he rejoined his aunt at their temporary abode, which was
a small dower-house not many hundred yards from the Manor. On the
following morning the two resumed a discussion that had now lasted for
some weeks as to the equipment of the new house. Mr. Denton laid
before his relative a statement of the results of his visit to
town--particulars of carpets, of chairs, of wardrobes, and of bedroom
china. "Yes, dear," said his aunt, "but I don't see any chintzes here.
Did you go to ----?" Mr. Denton stamped on the floor (where else,
indeed, could he have stamped?). "Oh dear, oh dear," he said, "the one
thing I missed. I _am_ sorry. The fact is I was on my way there and I
happened to be passing Robins's." His aunt threw up her hands.
"Robins's! Then the next thing will be another parcel of horrible old
books at some outrageous price. I do think, James, when I am taking
all this trouble for you, you might contrive to remember the one or
two things which I specially begged you to see after. It's not as if I
was asking it for myself. I don't know whether you think I get any
pleasure out of it, but if so I can assure you it's very much the
reverse. The thought and worry and trouble I have over it you have no
idea of, and _you_ have simply to go to the shops and order the
things." Mr. Denton interposed a moan of penitence. "Oh, aunt----"
"Yes, that's all very well, dear, and I don't want to speak sharply,
but you _must_ know how very annoying it is: particularly as it delays
the whole of our business for I can't tell how long: here is
Wednesday--the Simpsons come to-morrow, and you can't leave them. Then
on Saturday we have friends, as you know, coming for tennis. Yes,
indeed, you spoke of asking them yourself, but, of course, I had to
write the notes, and it is ridiculous, James, to look like that. We
must occasionally be civil to our neighbours: you wouldn't like to
have it said we were perfect bears. What was I saying? Well, anyhow it
comes to this, that it must be Thursday in next week at least, before
you can go to town again, and until we have decided upon the chintzes
it is impossible to settle upon one single other thing."

Mr. Denton ventured to suggest that as the paint and wallpapers had
been dealt with, this was too severe a view: but this his aunt was
not prepared to admit at the moment. Nor, indeed, was there any
proposition he could have advanced which she would have found herself
able to accept. However, as the day went on, she receded a little from
this position: examined with lessening disfavour the samples and price
lists submitted by her nephew, and even in some cases gave a qualified
approval to his choice.

As for him, he was naturally somewhat dashed by the consciousness of
duty unfulfilled, but more so by the prospect of a lawn-tennis party,
which, though an inevitable evil in August, he had thought there was
no occasion to fear in May. But he was to some extent cheered by the
arrival on the Friday morning of an intimation that he had secured at
the price of Â£12 10s. the four volumes of Poynter's manuscript diary,
and still more by the arrival on the next morning of the diary itself.

The necessity of taking Mr. and Mrs. Simpson for a drive in the car on
Saturday morning and of attending to his neighbours and guests that
afternoon prevented him from doing more than open the parcel until the
party had retired to bed on the Saturday night. It was then that he
made certain of the fact, which he had before only suspected, that he
had indeed acquired the diary of Mr. William Poynter, Squire of
Acrington (about four miles from his own parish)--that same Poynter
who was for a time a member of the circle of Oxford antiquaries, the
centre of which was Thomas Hearne, and with whom Hearne seems
ultimately to have quarrelled--a not uncommon episode in the career of
that excellent man. As is the case with Hearne's own collections, the
diary of Poynter contained a good many notes from printed books,
descriptions of coins and other antiquities that had been brought to
his notice, and drafts of letters on these subjects, besides the
chronicle of everyday events. The description in the sale-catalogue
had given Mr. Denton no idea of the amount of interest which seemed to
lie in the book, and he sat up reading in the first of the four
volumes until a reprehensibly late hour.

On the Sunday morning, after church, his aunt came into the study and
was diverted from what she had been going to say to him by the sight
of the four brown leather quartos on the table. "What are these?" she
said suspiciously. "New, aren't they? Oh! are these the things that
made you forget my chintzes? I thought so. Disgusting. What did you
give for them, I should like to know? Over Ten Pounds? James, it is
really sinful. Well, if you have money to throw away on this kind of
thing, there _can_ be no reason why you should not subscribe--and
subscribe handsomely--to my anti-Vivisection League. There is not,
indeed, James, and I shall be very seriously annoyed if----. Who did
you say wrote them? Old Mr. Poynter, of Acrington? Well, of course,
there is some interest in getting together old papers about this
neighbourhood. But Ten Pounds!" She picked up one of the volumes--not
that which her nephew had been reading--and opened it at random,
dashing it to the floor the next instant with a cry of disgust as a
earwig fell from between the pages. Mr. Denton picked it up with a
smothered expletive and said, "Poor book! I think you're rather hard
on Mr. Poynter." "Was I, my dear? I beg his pardon, but you know I
cannot abide those horrid creatures. Let me see if I've done any
mischief." "No, I think all's well: but look here what you've opened
him on." "Dear me, yes, to be sure! how very interesting. Do unpin it,
James, and let me look at it."

It was a piece of patterned stuff about the size of the quarto page,
to which it was fastened by an old-fashioned pin. James detached it
and handed it to his aunt, carefully replacing the pin in the paper.

Now, I do not know exactly what the fabric was; but it had a design
printed upon it, which completely fascinated Miss Denton. She went
into raptures over it, held it against the wall, made James do the
same, that she might retire to contemplate it from a distance: then
pored over it at close quarters, and ended her examination by
expressing in the warmest terms her appreciation of the taste of the
ancient Mr. Poynter who had had the happy idea of preserving this
sample in his diary. "It is a most charming pattern," she said, "and
remarkable too. Look, James, how delightfully the lines ripple. It
reminds one of hair, very much, doesn't it. And then these knots of
ribbon at intervals. They give just the relief of colour that is
wanted. I wonder----" "I was going to say," said James with deference,
"I wonder if it would cost much to have it copied for our curtains."
"Copied? how could you have it copied, James?" "Well, I don't know the
details, but I suppose that is a printed pattern, and that you could
have a block cut from it in wood or metal." "Now, really, that is a
capital idea, James. I am almost inclined to be glad that you were
so--that you forgot the chintzes on Monday. At any rate, I'll promise
to forgive and forget if you get this _lovely_ old thing copied. No
one will have anything in the least like it, and mind, James, we won't
allow it to be sold. Now I _must_ go, and I've totally forgotten what
it was I came in to say: never mind, it'll keep."

After his aunt had gone James Denton devoted a few minutes to
examining the pattern more closely than he had yet had a chance of
doing. He was puzzled to think why it should have struck Miss Denton
so forcibly. It seemed to him not specially remarkable or pretty. No
doubt it was suitable enough for a curtain pattern: it ran in vertical
bands, and there was some indication that these were intended to
converge at the top. She was right, too, in thinking that these main
bands resembled rippling--almost curling--tresses of hair. Well, the
main thing was to find out by means of trade directories, or
otherwise, what firm would undertake the reproduction of an old
pattern of this kind. Not to delay the reader over this portion of
the story, a list of likely names was made out, and Mr. Denton fixed a
day for calling on them, or some of them, with his sample.

The first two visits which he paid were unsuccessful: but there is
luck in odd numbers. The firm in Bermondsey which was third on his
list was accustomed to handling this line. The evidence they were able
to produce justified their being entrusted with the job. "Our Mr.
Cattell" took a fervent personal interest in it. "It's 'eartrending,
isn't it, sir," he said, "to picture the quantity of reelly lovely
medeevial stuff of this kind that lays well-nigh unnoticed in many of
our residential country 'ouses: much of it in peril, I take it, of
being cast aside as so much rubbish. What is it Shakespeare
says--unconsidered trifles. Ah, I often say he 'as a word for us all,
sir. I say Shakespeare, but I'm well aware all don't 'old with me
there--I 'ad something of an upset the other day when a gentleman came
in--a titled man, too, he was, and I think he told me he'd wrote on
the topic, and I 'appened to cite out something about 'Ercules and the
painted cloth. Dear me, you never see such a pother. But as to this,
what you've kindly confided to us, it's a piece of work we shall take
a reel enthusiasm in achieving it out to the very best of our ability.
What man 'as done, as I was observing only a few weeks back to another
esteemed client, man can do, and in three to four weeks' time, all
being well, we shall 'ope to lay before you evidence to that effect,
sir. Take the address, Mr. 'Iggins, if you please."

Such was the general drift of Mr. Cattell's observations on the
occasion of his first interview with Mr. Denton. About a month later,
being advised that some samples were ready for his inspection, Mr.
Denton met him again, and had, it seems, reason to be satisfied with
the faithfulness of the reproduction of the design. It had been
finished off at the top in accordance with the indication I mentioned,
so that the vertical bands joined. But something still needed to be
done in the way of matching the colour of the original. Mr. Cattell
had suggestions of a technical kind to offer, with which I need not
trouble you. He had also views as to the general desirability of the
pattern which were vaguely adverse. "You say you don't wish this to be
supplied excepting to personal friends equipped with a authorization
from yourself, sir. It shall be done. I quite understand your wish to
keep it exclusive: lends a catchit, does it not, to the suite?
What's every man's, it's been said, is no man's."

"Do you think it would be popular if it were generally obtainable?"
asked Mr. Denton.

"I 'ardly think it, sir," said Cattell, pensively clasping his beard.
"I 'ardly think it. Not popular: it wasn't popular with the man that
cut the block, was it, Mr. 'Iggins?"

"Did he find it a difficult job?"

"He'd no call to do so, sir; but the fact is that the artistic
temperament--and our men are artists, sir, every man of them--true
artists as much as many that the world styles by that term--it's apt
to take some strange 'ardly accountable likes or dislikes, and here
was an example. The twice or thrice that I went to inspect his
progress: language I could understand, for that's 'abitual to him, but
reel distaste for what I should call a dainty enough thing, I did not,
nor am I now able to fathom. It seemed," said Mr. Cattell, looking
narrowly upon Mr. Denton, "as if the man scented something almost
Hevil in the design."

"Indeed? did he tell you so? I can't say I see anything sinister in it
myself."

"Neether can I, sir. In fact I said as much. 'Come, Gatwick,' I said,
'what's to do here? What's the reason of your prejudice--for I can
call it no more than that?' But, no! no explanation was forthcoming.
And I was merely reduced, as I am now, to a shrug of the shoulders,
and a _cui bono_. However, here it is," and with that the technical
side of the question came to the front again.

The matching of the colours for the background, the hem, and the knots
of ribbon was by far the longest part of the business, and
necessitated many sendings to and fro of the original pattern and of
new samples. During part of August and September, too, the Dentons
were away from the Manor. So that it was not until October was well in
that a sufficient quantity of the stuff had been manufactured to
furnish curtains for the three or four bedrooms which were to be
fitted up with it.

On the feast of Simon and Jude the aunt and nephew returned from a
short visit to find all completed, and their satisfaction at the
general effect was great. The new curtains, in particular, agreed to
admiration with their surroundings. When Mr. Denton was dressing for
dinner, and took stock of his room, in which there was a large amount
of the chintz displayed, he congratulated himself over and over again
on the luck which had first made him forget his aunt's commission and
had then put into his hands this extremely effective means of
remedying his mistake. The pattern was, as he said at dinner, so
restful and yet so far from being dull. And Miss Denton--who, by the
way, had none of the stuff in her own room--was much disposed to agree
with him.

At breakfast next morning he was induced to qualify his satisfaction
to some extent--but very slightly. "There is one thing I rather
regret," he said, "that we allowed them to join up the vertical bands
of the pattern at the top. I think it would have been better to leave
that alone."

"Oh?" said his aunt interrogatively.

"Yes: as I was reading in bed last night they kept catching my eye
rather. That is, I found myself looking across at them every now and
then. There was an effect as if some one kept peeping out between the
curtains in one place or another, where there was no edge, and I think
that was due to the joining up of the bands at the top. The only other
thing that troubled me was the wind."

"Why, I thought it was a perfectly still night."

"Perhaps it was only on my side of the house, but there was enough to
sway my curtains and rustle them more than I wanted."

That night a bachelor friend of James Denton's came to stay, and was
lodged in a room on the same floor as his host, but at the end of a
long passage, halfway down which was a red baize door, put there to
cut off the draught and intercept noise.

The party of three had separated. Miss Denton a good first, the two
men at about eleven. James Denton, not yet inclined for bed, sat him
down in an arm-chair and read for a time. Then he dozed, and then he
woke, and bethought himself that his brown spaniel, which ordinarily
slept in his room, had not come upstairs with him. Then he thought he
was mistaken: for happening to move his hand which hung down over the
arm of the chair within a few inches of the floor, he felt on the back
of it just the slightest touch of a surface of hair, and stretching it
out in that direction he stroked and patted a rounded something. But
the feel of it, and still more the fact that instead of a responsive
movement, absolute stillness greeted his touch, made him look over
the arm. What he had been touching rose to meet him. It was in the
attitude of one that had crept along the floor on its belly, and it
was, so far as could be collected, a human figure. But of the face
which was now rising to within a few inches of his own no feature was
discernible, only hair. Shapeless as it was, there was about it so
horrible an air of menace that as he bounded from his chair and rushed
from the room he heard himself moaning with fear: and doubtless he did
right to fly. As he dashed into the baize door that cut the passage in
two, and--forgetting that it opened towards him--beat against it with
all the force in him, he felt a soft ineffectual tearing at his back
which, all the same, seemed to be growing in power, as if the hand, or
whatever worse than a hand was there, were becoming more material as
the pursuer's rage was more concentrated. Then he remembered the trick
of the door--he got it open--he shut it behind him--he gained his
friend's room, and that is all we need know.

It seems curious that, during all the time that had elapsed since the
purchase of Poynter's diary, James Denton should not have sought an
explanation of the presence of the pattern that had been pinned into
it. Well, he had read the diary through without finding it mentioned,
and had concluded that there was nothing to be said. But, on leaving
Rendcomb Manor (he did not know whether for good), as he naturally
insisted upon doing on the day after experiencing the horror I have
tried to put into words, he took the diary with him. And at his
seaside lodgings he examined more narrowly the portion whence the
pattern had been taken. What he remembered having suspected about it
turned out to be correct. Two or three leaves were pasted together,
but written upon, as was patent when they were held up to the light.
They yielded easily to steaming, for the paste had lost much of its
strength, and they contained something relevant to the pattern.

The entry was made in 1707.

     "Old Mr. Casbury, of Acrington, told me this day much of
     young Sir Everard Charlett, whom he remember'd Commoner of
     University College, and thought was of the same Family as
     Dr. Arthur Charlett, now master of ye Coll. This Charlett
     was a personable young gent., but a loose atheistical
     companion, and a great Lifter, as they then call'd the hard
     drinkers, and for what I know do so now. He was noted, and
     subject to severall censures at different times for his
     extravagancies: and if the full history of his debaucheries
     had bin known, no doubt would have been expell'd ye Coll.,
     supposing that no interest had been imploy'd on his behalf,
     of which Mr. Casbury had some suspicion. He was a very
     beautiful person, and constantly wore his own Hair, which
     was very abundant, from which, and his loose way of living,
     the cant name for him was Absalom, and he was accustom'd to
     say that indeed he believ'd he had shortened old David's
     days, meaning his father, Sir Job Charlett, an old worthy
     cavalier.

     "Note that Mr. Casbury said that he remembers not the year
     of Sir Everard Charlett's death, but it was 1692 or 3. He
     died suddenly in October. [Several lines describing his
     unpleasant habits and reputed delinquencies are omitted.]
     Having seen him in such topping spirits the night before,
     Mr. Casbury was amaz'd when he learn'd the death. He was
     found in the town ditch, the hair as was said pluck'd clean
     off his head. Most bells in Oxford rung out for him, being a
     nobleman, and he was buried next night in St. Peter's in the
     East. But two years after, being to be moved to his country
     estate by his successor, it was said the coffin, breaking by
     mischance, proved quite full of Hair: which sounds fabulous,
     but yet I believe precedents are upon record, as in Dr.
     Plot's _History of Staffordshire_.

     "His chambers being afterwards stripp'd, Mr. Casbury came by
     part of the hangings of it, which 'twas said this Charlett
     had design'd expressly for a memoriall of his Hair, giving
     the Fellow that drew it a lock to work by, and the piece
     which I have fasten'd in here was parcel of the same, which
     Mr. Casbury gave to me. He said he believ'd there was a
     subtlety in the drawing, but had never discover'd it
     himself, nor much liked to pore upon it."

       *       *       *       *       *

The money spent upon the curtains might as well have been thrown into
the fire, as they were. Mr. Cattell's comment upon what he heard of
the story took the form of a quotation from Shakespeare. You may guess
it without difficulty. It began with the words "There are more
things."




AN EPISODE OF CATHEDRAL HISTORY




AN EPISODE OF CATHEDRAL HISTORY


There was once a learned gentleman who was deputed to examine and
report upon the archives of the Cathedral of Southminster. The
examination of these records demanded a very considerable expenditure
of time: hence it became advisable for him to engage lodgings in the
city: for though the Cathedral body were profuse in their offers of
hospitality, Mr. Lake felt that he would prefer to be master of his
day. This was recognized as reasonable. The Dean eventually wrote
advising Mr. Lake, if he were not already suited, to communicate with
Mr. Worby, the principal Verger, who occupied a house convenient to
the church and was prepared to take in a quiet lodger for three or
four weeks. Such an arrangement was precisely what Mr. Lake desired.
Terms were easily agreed upon, and early in December, like another Mr.
Datchery (as he remarked to himself), the investigator found himself
in the occupation of a very comfortable room in an ancient and
"cathedraly" house.

One so familiar with the customs of Cathedral churches, and treated
with such obvious consideration by the Dean and Chapter of this
Cathedral in particular, could not fail to command the respect of the
Head Verger. Mr. Worby even acquiesced in certain modifications of
statements he had been accustomed to offer for years to parties of
visitors. Mr. Lake, on his part, found the Verger a very cheery
companion, and took advantage of any occasion that presented itself
for enjoying his conversation when the day's work was over.

One evening, about nine o'clock, Mr. Worby knocked at his lodger's
door. "I've occasion," he said, "to go across to the Cathedral, Mr.
Lake, and I think I made you a promise when I did so next I would give
you the opportunity to see what it looks like at night time. It is
quite fine and dry outside, if you care to come."

"To be sure I will; very much obliged to you, Mr. Worby, for thinking
of it, but let me get my coat."

"Here it is, sir, and I've another lantern here that you'll find
advisable for the steps, as there's no moon."

"Any one might think we were Jasper and Durdles, over again, mightn't
they," said Lake, as they crossed the close, for he had ascertained
that the Verger had read _Edwin Drood_.

"Well, so they might," said Mr. Worby, with a short laugh, "though I
don't know whether we ought to take it as a compliment. Odd ways, I
often think, they had at that Cathedral, don't it seem so to you, sir?
Full choral matins at seven o'clock in the morning all the year round.
Wouldn't suit our boys' voices nowadays, and I think there's one or
two of the men would be applying for a rise if the Chapter was to
bring it in--particular the alltoes."

They were now at the south-west door. As Mr. Worby was unlocking it,
Lake said, "Did you ever find anybody locked in here by accident?"

"Twice I did. One was a drunk sailor; however he got in I don't know.
I s'pose he went to sleep in the service, but by the time I got to him
he was praying fit to bring the roof in. Lor'! what a noise that man
did make! said it was the first time he'd been inside a church for ten
years, and blest if ever he'd try it again. The other was an old
sheep: them boys it was, up to their games. That was the last time
they tried it on, though. There, sir, now you see what we look like;
our late Dean used now and again to bring parties in, but he preferred
a moonlight night, and there was a piece of verse he'd coat to 'em,
relating to a Scotch cathedral, I understand; but I don't know; I
almost think the effect's better when it's all dark-like. Seems to add
to the size and heighth. Now if you won't mind stopping somewhere in
the nave while I go up into the choir where my business lays, you'll
see what I mean."

Accordingly Lake waited, leaning against a pillar, and watched the
light wavering along the length of the church, and up the steps into
the choir, until it was intercepted by some screen or other furniture,
which only allowed the reflection to be seen on the piers and roof.
Not many minutes had passed before Worby reappeared at the door of the
choir and by waving his lantern signalled to Lake to rejoin him.

"I suppose it _is_ Worby, and not a substitute," thought Lake to
himself, as he walked up the nave. There was, in fact, nothing
untoward. Worby showed him the papers which he had come to fetch out
of the Dean's stall, and asked him what he thought of the spectacle:
Lake agreed that it was well worth seeing. "I suppose," he said, as
they walked towards the altar-steps together, "that you're too much
used to going about here at night to feel nervous--but you must get a
start every now and then, don't you, when a book falls down or a door
swings to."

"No, Mr. Lake, I can't say I think much about noises, not nowadays:
I'm much more afraid of finding an escape of gas or a burst in the
stove pipes than anything else. Still there have been times, years
ago. Did you notice that plain altar-tomb there--fifteenth century we
say it is, I don't know if you agree to that? Well, if you didn't look
at it, just come back and give it a glance, if you'd be so good." It
was on the north side of the choir, and rather awkwardly placed: only
about three feet from the enclosing stone screen. Quite plain, as the
Verger had said, but for some ordinary stone panelling. A metal cross
of some size on the northern side (that next to the screen) was the
solitary feature of any interest.

Lake agreed that it was not earlier than the Perpendicular period:
"but," he said, "unless it's the tomb of some remarkable person,
you'll forgive me for saying that I don't think it's particularly
noteworthy."

"Well, I can't say as it is the tomb of anybody noted in 'istory,"
said Worby, who had a dry smile on his face, "for we don't own any
record whatsoever of who it was put up to. For all that, if you've
half an hour to spare, sir, when we get back to the house, Mr. Lake, I
could tell you a tale about that tomb. I won't begin on it now; it
strikes cold here, and we don't want to be dawdling about all night."

"Of course I should like to hear it immensely."

"Very well, sir, you shall. Now if I might put a question to you," he
went on, as they passed down the choir aisle, "in our little local
guide--and not only there, but in the little book on our Cathedral in
the series--you'll find it stated that this portion of the building
was erected previous to the twelfth century. Now of course I should be
glad enough to take that view, but--mind the step, sir--but, I put it
to you--does the lay of the stone 'ere in this portion of the wall
(which he tapped with his key) does it to your eye carry the flavour
of what you might call Saxon masonry? No, I thought not; no more it
does to me: now, if you'll believe me, I've said as much to those
men--one's the librarian of our Free Libry here, and the other came
down from London on purpose--fifty times, if I have once, but I might
just as well have talked to that bit of stonework. But there it is, I
suppose every one's got their opinions."

The discussion of this peculiar trait of human nature occupied Mr.
Worby almost up to the moment when he and Lake re-entered the former's
house. The condition of the fire in Lake's sitting-room led to a
suggestion from Mr. Worby that they should finish the evening in his
own parlour. We find them accordingly settled there some short time
afterwards.

Mr. Worby made his story a long one, and I will not undertake to tell
it wholly in his own words, or in his own order. Lake committed the
substance of it to paper immediately after hearing it, together with
some few passages of the narrative which had fixed themselves
_verbatim_ in his mind; I shall probably find it expedient to condense
Lake's record to some extent.

Mr. Worby was born, it appeared, about the year 1828. His father
before him had been connected with the Cathedral, and likewise his
grandfather. One or both had been choristers, and in later life both
had done work as mason and carpenter respectively about the fabric.
Worby himself, though possessed, as he frankly acknowledged, of an
indifferent voice, had been drafted into the choir at about ten years
of age.

It was in 1840 that the wave of the Gothic revival smote the Cathedral
of Southminster. "There was a lot of lovely stuff went then, sir,"
said Worby, with a sigh. "My father couldn't hardly believe it when he
got his orders to clear out the choir. There was a new dean just come
in--Dean Burscough it was--and my father had been 'prenticed to a good
firm of joiners in the city, and knew what good work was when he saw
it. Crool it was, he used to say: all that beautiful wainscot oak, as
good as the day it was put up, and garlands-like of foliage and fruit,
and lovely old gilding work on the coats of arms and the organ pipes.
All went to the timber yard--every bit except some little pieces
worked up in the Lady Chapel, and 'ere in this overmantel. Well--I may
be mistook, but I say our choir never looked as well since. Still
there was a lot found out about the history of the church, and no
doubt but what it did stand in need of repair. There was very few
winters passed but what we'd lose a pinnicle." Mr. Lake expressed his
concurrence with Worby's views of restoration, but owns to a fear
about this point lest the story proper should never be reached.
Possibly this was perceptible in his manner.

Worby hastened to reassure him, "Not but what I could carry on about
that topic for hours at a time, and do do when I see my opportunity.
But Dean Burscough he was very set on the Gothic period, and nothing
would serve him but everything must be made agreeable to that. And one
morning after service he appointed for my father to meet him in the
choir, and he came back after he'd taken off his robes in the vestry,
and he'd got a roll of paper with him, and the verger that was then
brought in a table, and they begun spreading it out on the table with
prayer books to keep it down, and my father helped 'em, and he saw it
was a picture of the inside of a choir in a Cathedral; and the
Dean--he was a quick spoken gentleman--he says, 'Well, Worby, what do
you think of that?' 'Why', says my father, 'I don't think I 'ave the
pleasure of knowing that view. Would that be Hereford Cathedral, Mr.
Dean?' 'No, Worby,' says the Dean, 'that's Southminster Cathedral as
we hope to see it before many years.' 'In-deed, sir,' says my father,
and that was all he did say--leastways to the Dean--but he used to
tell me he felt really faint in himself when he looked round our
choir as I can remember it, all comfortable and furnished-like, and
then see this nasty little dry picter, as he called it, drawn out by
some London architect. Well, there I am again. But you'll see what I
mean if you look at this old view."

Worby reached down a framed print from the wall. "Well, the long and
the short of it was that the Dean he handed over to my father a copy
of an order of the Chapter that he was to clear out every bit of the
choir--make a clean sweep--ready for the new work that was being
designed up in town, and he was to put it in hand as soon as ever he
could get the breakers together. Now then, sir, if you look at that
view, you'll see where the pulpit used to stand: that's what I want
you to notice, if you please." It was, indeed, easily seen; an
unusually large structure of timber with a domed sounding-board,
standing at the east end of the stalls on the north side of the choir,
facing the bishop's throne. Worby proceeded to explain that during the
alterations, services were held in the nave, the members of the choir
being thereby disappointed of an anticipated holiday, and the organist
in particular incurring the suspicion of having wilfully damaged the
mechanism of the temporary organ that was hired at considerable
expense from London.

The work of demolition began with the choir screen and organ loft, and
proceeded gradually eastwards, disclosing, as Worby said, many
interesting features of older work. While this was going on, the
members of the Chapter were, naturally, in and about the choir a great
deal, and it soon became apparent to the elder Worby--who could not
help overhearing some of their talk--that, on the part of the senior
Canons especially, there must have been a good deal of disagreement
before the policy now being carried out had been adopted. Some were of
opinion that they should catch their deaths of cold in the
return-stalls, unprotected by a screen from the draughts in the nave:
others objected to being exposed to the view of persons in the choir
aisles, especially, they said, during the sermons, when they found it
helpful to listen in a posture which was liable to misconstruction.
The strongest opposition, however, came from the oldest of the body,
who up to the last moment objected to the removal of the pulpit. "You
ought not to touch it, Mr. Dean," he said with great emphasis one
morning, when the two were standing before it: "you don't know what
mischief you may do." "Mischief? it's not a work of any particular
merit, Canon." "Don't call me Canon," said the old man with great
asperity, "that is, for thirty years I've been known as Dr. Ayloff,
and I shall be obliged, Mr. Dean, if you would kindly humour me in
that matter. And as to the pulpit (which I've preached from for thirty
years, though I don't insist on that) all I'll say is, I _know_ you're
doing wrong in moving it." "But what sense could there be, my dear
Doctor, in leaving it where it is, when we're fitting up the rest of
the choir in a totally different _style_? What reason could be
given--apart from the look of the thing?" "Reason! reason!" said old
Dr. Ayloff; "if you young men--if I may say so without any disrespect,
Mr. Dean--if you'd only listen to reason a little, and not be always
asking for it, we should get on better. But there, I've said my say."
The old gentleman hobbled off, and as it proved, never entered the
Cathedral again. The season--it was a hot summer--turned sickly on a
sudden. Dr. Ayloff was one of the first to go, with some affection of
the muscles of the thorax, which took him painfully at night. And at
many services the number of choirmen and boys was very thin.

Meanwhile the pulpit had been done away with. In fact, the
sounding-board (part of which still exists as a table in a
summer-house in the palace garden) was taken down within an hour or
two of Dr. Ayloff's protest. The removal of the base--not effected
without considerable trouble--disclosed to view, greatly to the
exultation of the restoring party, an altar-tomb--the tomb, of course,
to which Worby had attracted Lake's attention that same evening. Much
fruitless research was expended in attempts to identify the occupant;
from that day to this he has never had a name put to him. The
structure had been most carefully boxed in under the pulpit-base, so
that such slight ornament as it possessed was not defaced; only on the
north side of it there was what looked like an injury; a gap between
two of the slabs composing the side. It might be two or three inches
across. Palmer, the mason, was directed to fill it up in a week's
time, when he came to do some other small jobs near that part of the
choir.

The season was undoubtedly a very trying one. Whether the church was
built on a site that had once been a marsh, as was suggested, or for
whatever reason, the residents in its immediate neighbourhood had,
many of them, but little enjoyment of the exquisite sunny days and
the calm nights of August and September. To several of the older
people--Dr. Ayloff, among others, as we have seen--the summer proved
downright fatal, but even among the younger, few escaped either a
sojourn in bed for a matter of weeks, or at the least, a brooding
sense of oppression, accompanied by hateful nightmares. Gradually
there formulated itself a suspicion--which grew into a conviction--that
the alterations in the Cathedral had something to say in the matter.
The widow of a former old verger, a pensioner of the Chapter of
Southminster, was visited by dreams, which she retailed to her
friends, of a shape that slipped out of the little door of the south
transept as the dark fell in, and flitted--taking a fresh direction
every night--about the close, disappearing for a while in house after
house, and finally emerging again when the night sky was paling. She
could see nothing of it, she said, but that it was a moving form: only
she had an impression that when it returned to the church, as it
seemed to do in the end of the dream, it turned its head: and then,
she could not tell why, but she thought it had red eyes. Worby
remembered hearing the old lady tell this dream at a tea-party in the
house of the chapter clerk. Its recurrence might, perhaps, he said, be
taken as a symptom of approaching illness; at any rate before the end
of September the old lady was in her grave.

The interest excited by the restoration of this great church was not
confined to its own county. One day that summer an F.S.A., of some
celebrity, visited the place. His business was to write an account of
the discoveries that had been made, for the Society of Antiquaries,
and his wife, who accompanied him, was to make a series of
illustrative drawings for his report. In the morning she employed
herself in making a general sketch of the choir; in the afternoon she
devoted herself to details. She first drew the newly exposed
altar-tomb, and when that was finished, she called her husband's
attention to a beautiful piece of diaper-ornament on the screen just
behind it, which had, like the tomb itself, been completely concealed
by the pulpit. Of course, he said, an illustration of that must be
made; so she seated herself on the tomb and began a careful drawing
which occupied her till dusk.

Her husband had by this time finished his work of measuring and
description, and they agreed that it was time to be getting back to
their hotel. "You may as well brush my skirt, Frank," said the lady,
"it must have got covered with dust, I'm sure." He obeyed dutifully;
but, after a moment, he said, "I don't know whether you value this
dress particularly, my dear, but I'm inclined to think it's seen its
best days. There's a great bit of it gone." "Gone? Where?" said she.
"I don't know where it's gone, but it's off at the bottom edge behind
here." She pulled it hastily into sight, and was horrified to find a
jagged tear extending some way into the substance of the stuff; very
much, she said, as if a dog had rent it away. The dress was, in any
case, hopelessly spoilt, to her great vexation, and though they looked
everywhere, the missing piece could not be found. There were many
ways, they concluded, in which the injury might have come about, for
the choir was full of old bits of woodwork with nails sticking out of
them. Finally, they could only suppose that one of these had caused
the mischief, and that the workmen, who had been about all day, had
carried off the particular piece with the fragment of dress still
attached to it.

It was about this time, Worby thought, that his little dog began to
wear an anxious expression when the hour for it to be put into the
shed in the back yard approached. (For his mother had ordained that it
must not sleep in the house.) One evening, he said, when he was just
going to pick it up and carry it out, it looked at him "like a
Christian, and waved its 'and, I was going to say--well, you know 'ow
they do carry on sometimes, and the end of it was I put it under my
coat, and 'uddled it upstairs--and I'm afraid I as good as deceived my
poor mother on the subject. After that the dog acted very artful with
'iding itself under the bed for half-an-hour or more before bed-time
came, and we worked it so as my mother never found out what we'd
done." Of course Worby was glad of its company anyhow, but more
particularly when the nuisance that is still remembered in
Southminster as "the crying" set in.

"Night after night," said Worby, "that dog seemed to know it was
coming; he'd creep out, he would, and snuggle into the bed and cuddle
right up to me shivering, and when the crying come he'd be like a wild
thing, shoving his head under my arm, and I was fully near as bad. Six
or seven times we'd hear it, not more, and when he'd dror out his 'ed
again I'd know it was over for that night. What was it like, sir?
Well, I never heard but one thing that seemed to hit it off. I
happened to be playing about in the Close, and there was two of the
Canons met and said 'Good morning' one to another. 'Sleep well last
night?' says one--it was Mr. Henslow that one, and Mr. Lyall was the
other--'Can't say I did,' says Mr. Lyall, 'rather too much of Isaiah
34. 14 for me.' '34. 14,' says Mr. Henslow, 'what's that?' 'You call
yourself a Bible reader!' says Mr. Lyall. (Mr. Henslow, you must know,
he was one of what used to be termed Simeon's lot--pretty much what we
should call the Evangelical party.) 'You go and look it up.' I wanted
to know what he was getting at myself, and so off I ran home and got
out my own Bible, and there it was: 'the satyr shall cry to his
fellow.' Well, I thought, is that what we've been listening to these
past nights? and I tell you it made me look over my shoulder a time or
two. Of course I'd asked my father and mother about what it could be
before that, but they both said it was most likely cats: but they
spoke very short, and I could see they was troubled. My word! that was
a noise--'ungry-like, as if it was calling after some one that
wouldn't come. If ever you felt you wanted company, it would be when
you was waiting for it to begin again. I believe two or three nights
there was men put on to watch in different parts of the Close; but
they all used to get together in one corner, the nearest they could to
the High Street, and nothing came of it.

"Well, the next thing was this. Me and another of the boys--he's in
business in the city now as a grocer, like his father before him--we'd
gone up in the Close after morning service was over, and we heard old
Palmer the mason bellowing to some of his men. So we went up nearer,
because we knew he was a rusty old chap and there might be some fun
going. It appears Palmer'd told this man to stop up the chink in that
old tomb. Well, there was this man keeping on saying he'd done it the
best he could, and there was Palmer carrying on like all possessed
about it. 'Call that making a job of it?' he says. 'If you had your
rights you'd get the sack for this. What do you suppose I pay you your
wages for? What do you suppose I'm going to say to the Dean and
Chapter when they come round, as come they may do any time, and see
where you've been bungling about covering the 'ole place with mess
and plaster and Lord knows what?' 'Well, master, I done the best I
could,' says the man; 'I don't know no more than what you do 'ow it
come to fall out this way. I tamped it right in the 'ole,' he says,
'and now it's fell out,' he says, 'I never see.'

"'Fell out?' says old Palmer, 'why it's nowhere near the place. Blowed
out, you mean,' and he picked up a bit of plaster, and so did I, that
was laying up against the screen, three or four feet off, and not dry
yet; and old Palmer he looked at it curious-like, and then he turned
round on me and he says, 'Now then, you boys, have you been up to some
of your games here?' 'No,' I says, 'I haven't, Mr. Palmer; there's
none of us been about here till just this minute,' and while I was
talking the other boy, Evans, he got looking in through the chink, and
I heard him draw in his breath, and he came away sharp and up to us,
and says he, 'I believe there's something in there. I saw something
shiny.' 'What! I daresay,' says old Palmer; 'Well, I ain't got time to
stop about there. You, William, you go off and get some more stuff and
make a job of it this time; if not, there'll be trouble in my yard,'
he says.

"So the man he went off, and Palmer too, and us boys stopped behind,
and I says to Evans, 'Did you really see anything in there?' 'Yes,' he
says, 'I did indeed.' So then I says, 'Let's shove something in and
stir it up.' And we tried several of the bits of wood that was laying
about, but they were all too big. Then Evans he had a sheet of music
he'd brought with him, an anthem or a service, I forget which it was
now, and he rolled it up small and shoved it in the chink; two or
three times he did it, and nothing happened. 'Give it me, boy,' I
said, and I had a try. No, nothing happened. Then, I don't know why I
thought of it, I'm sure, but I stooped down just opposite the chink
and put my two fingers in my mouth and whistled--you know the way--and
at that I seemed to think I heard something stirring, and I says to
Evans, 'Come away,' I says; 'I don't like this.' 'Oh, rot,' he says,
'Give me that roll,' and he took it and shoved it in. And I don't
think ever I see any one go so pale as he did. 'I say, Worby,' he
says, 'it's caught, or else some one's got hold of it.' 'Pull it out
or leave it,' I says, 'Come and let's get off.' So he gave a good
pull, and it came away. Leastways most of it did, but the end was
gone. Torn off it was, and Evans looked at it for a second and then he
gave a sort of a croak and let it drop, and we both made off out of
there as quick as ever we could. When we got outside Evans says to me,
'Did you see the end of that paper.' 'No,' I says, 'only it was torn.'
'Yes, it was,' he says, 'but it was wet too, and black!' Well, partly
because of the fright we had, and partly because that music was wanted
in a day or two, and we knew there'd be a set-out about it with the
organist, we didn't say nothing to any one else, and I suppose the
workmen they swept up the bit that was left along with the rest of the
rubbish. But Evans, if you were to ask him this very day about it,
he'd stick to it he saw that paper wet and black at the end where it
was torn."

After that the boys gave the choir a wide berth, so that Worby was not
sure what was the result of the mason's renewed mending of the tomb.
Only he made out from fragments of conversation dropped by the workmen
passing through the choir that some difficulty had been met with, and
that the governor--Mr. Palmer to wit--had tried his own hand at the
job. A little later, he happened to see Mr. Palmer himself knocking at
the door of the Deanery and being admitted by the butler. A day or so
after that, he gathered from a remark his father let fall at breakfast
that something a little out of the common was to be done in the
Cathedral after morning service on the morrow. "And I'd just as soon
it was to-day," his father added, "I don't see the use of running
risks." "'Father,' I says, 'what are you going to do in the Cathedral
to-morrow?' and he turned on me as savage as I ever see him--he was a
wonderful good-tempered man as a general thing, my poor father was.
'My lad,' he says, 'I'll trouble you not to go picking up your elders'
and betters' talk: it's not manners and it's not straight. What I'm
going to do or not going to do in the Cathedral to-morrow is none of
your business: and if I catch sight of you hanging about the place
to-morrow after your work's done, I'll send you home with a flea in
your ear. Now you mind that.' Of course I said I was very sorry and
that, and equally of course I went off and laid my plans with Evans.
We knew there was a stair up in the corner of the transept which you
can get up to the triforium, and in them days the door to it was
pretty well always open, and even if it wasn't we knew the key usually
laid under a bit of matting hard by. So we made up our minds we'd be
putting away music and that, next morning while the rest of the boys
was clearing off, and then slip up the stairs and watch from the
triforium if there was any signs of work going on.

"Well, that same night I dropped off asleep as sound as a boy does,
and all of a sudden the dog woke me up, coming into the bed, and
thought I, now we're going to get it sharp, for he seemed more
frightened than usual. After about five minutes sure enough came this
cry. I can't give you no idea what it was like; and so near
too--nearer than I'd heard it yet--and a funny thing, Mr. Lake, you
know what a place this Close is for an echo, and particular if you
stand this side of it. Well, this crying never made no sign of an echo
at all. But, as I said, it was dreadful near this night; and on the
top of the start I got with hearing it, I got another fright; for I
heard something rustling outside in the passage. Now to be sure I
thought I was done; but I noticed the dog seemed to perk up a bit, and
next there was some one whispered outside the door, and I very near
laughed out loud, for I knew it was my father and mother that had got
out of bed with the noise. 'Whatever is it?' says my mother. 'Hush! I
don't know,' says my father, excited-like, 'don't disturb the boy. I
hope he didn't hear nothing.'

"So, me knowing they were just outside, it made me bolder, and I
slipped out of bed across to my little window--giving on the
Close--but the dog he bored right down to the bottom of the bed--and I
looked out. First go off I couldn't see anything. Then right down in
the shadow under a buttress I made out what I shall always say was two
spots of red--a dull red it was--nothing like a lamp or a fire, but
just so as you could pick 'em out of the black shadow. I hadn't but
just sighted 'em when it seemed we wasn't the only people that had
been disturbed, because I see a window in a house on the left-hand
side become lighted up, and the light moving. I just turned my head to
make sure of it, and then looked back into the shadow for those two
red things, and they were gone, and for all I peered about and stared,
there was not a sign more of them. Then come my last fright that
night--something come against my bare leg--but that was all right:
that was my little dog had come out of bed, and prancing about, making
a great to-do, only holding his tongue, and me seeing he was quite in
spirits again, I took him back to bed and we slept the night out!

"Next morning I made out to tell my mother I'd had the dog in my room,
and I was surprised, after all she'd said about it before, how quiet
she took it. 'Did you?' she says. 'Well, by good rights you ought to
go without your breakfast for doing such a thing behind my back: but I
don't know as there's any great harm done, only another time you ask
my permission, do you hear?' A bit after that I said something to my
father about having heard the cats again. '_Cats_,' he says, and he
looked over at my poor mother, and she coughed and he says, 'Oh! ah!
yes, cats. I believe I heard 'em myself.'

"That was a funny morning altogether: nothing seemed to go right. The
organist he stopped in bed, and the minor Canon he forgot it was the
19th day and waited for the _Venite_; and after a bit the deputy he
set off playing the chant for evensong, which was a minor; and then
the Decani boys were laughing so much they couldn't sing, and when it
came to the anthem the solo boy he got took with the giggles, and made
out his nose was bleeding, and shoved the book at me what hadn't
practised the verse and wasn't much of a singer if I had known it.
Well, things was rougher, you see, fifty years ago, and I got a nip
from the counter-tenor behind me that I remembered.

"So we got through somehow, and neither the men nor the boys weren't
by way of waiting to see whether the Canon in residence--Mr. Henslow
it was--would come to the vestries and fine 'em, but I don't believe
he did: for one thing I fancy he'd read the wrong lesson for the first
time in his life, and knew it. Anyhow Evans and me didn't find no
difficulty in slipping up the stairs as I told you, and when we got up
we laid ourselves down flat on our stomachs where we could just
stretch our heads out over the old tomb, and we hadn't but just done
so when we heard the verger that was then, first shutting the iron
porch-gates and locking the south-west door, and then the transept
door, so we knew there was something up, and they meant to keep the
public out for a bit.

"Next thing was, the Dean and the Canon come in by their door on the
north, and then I see my father, and old Palmer, and a couple of their
best men, and Palmer stood a talking for a bit with the Dean in the
middle of the choir. He had a coil of rope and the men had crows. All
of 'em looked a bit nervous. So there they stood talking, and at last
I heard the Dean say, 'Well, I've no time to waste, Palmer. If you
think this'll satisfy Southminster people, I'll permit it to be done;
but I must say this, that never in the whole course of my life have I
heard such arrant nonsense from a practical man as I have from you.
Don't you agree with me, Henslow?' As far as I could hear Mr. Henslow
said something like 'Oh! well we're told, aren't we, Mr. Dean, not to
judge others?' and the Dean he gave a kind of sniff, and walked
straight up to the tomb, and took his stand behind it with his back to
the screen, and the others they come edging up rather gingerly.
Henslow, he stopped on the south side and scratched on his chin, he
did. Then the Dean spoke up: 'Palmer,' he says, 'which can you do
easiest, get the slab off the top, or shift one of the side slabs?'

"Old Palmer and his men they pottered about a bit looking round the
edge of the top slab and sounding the sides on the south and east and
west and everywhere but the north. Henslow said something about it
being better to have a try at the south side, because there was more
light and more room to move about in. Then my father, who'd been
watching of them, went round to the north side, and knelt down and
felt of the slab by the chink, and he got up and dusted his knees and
says to the Dean: 'Beg pardon, Mr. Dean, but I think if Mr. Palmer'll
try this here slab he'll find it'll come out easy enough. Seems to me
one of the men could prize it out with his crow by means of this
chink.' 'Ah! thank you, Worby,' says the Dean; 'that's a good
suggestion. Palmer, let one of your men do that, will you?'

"So the man come round, and put his bar in and bore on it, and just
that minute when they were all bending over, and we boys got our heads
well out over the edge of the triforium, there come a most fearful
crash down at the west end of the choir, as if a whole stack of big
timber had fallen down a flight of stairs. Well, you can't expect me
to tell you everything that happened all in a minute. Of course there
was a terrible commotion. I heard the slab fall out, and the crowbar
on the floor, and I heard the Dean say 'Good God!'

"When I looked down again I saw the Dean tumbled over on the floor,
the men was making off down the choir, Henslow was just going to help
the Dean up, Palmer was going to stop the men, as he said afterwards,
and my father was sitting on the altar step with his face in his
hands. The Dean he was very cross. 'I wish to goodness you'd look
where you're coming to, Henslow,' he says. 'Why you should all take
to your heels when a stick of wood tumbles down I cannot imagine,' and
all Henslow could do, explaining he was right away on the other side
of the tomb, would not satisfy him.

"Then Palmer came back and reported there was nothing to account for
this noise and nothing seemingly fallen down, and when the Dean
finished feeling of himself they gathered round--except my father, he
sat where he was--and some one lighted up a bit of candle and they
looked into the tomb. 'Nothing there,' says the Dean, 'what did I tell
you? Stay! here's something. What's this: a bit of music paper, and a
piece of torn stuff--part of a dress it looks like. Both quite
modern--no interest whatever. Another time perhaps you'll take the
advice of an educated man'--or something like that, and off he went,
limping a bit, and out through the north door, only as he went he
called back angry to Palmer for leaving the door standing open. Palmer
called out 'Very sorry, sir,' but he shrugged his shoulders, and
Henslow says, 'I fancy Mr. Dean's mistaken. I closed the door behind
me, but he's a little upset.' Then Palmer says, 'Why, where's Worby?'
and they saw him sitting on the step and went up to him. He was
recovering himself, it seemed, and wiping his forehead, and Palmer
helped him up on to his legs, as I was glad to see.

"They were too far off for me to hear what they said, but my father
pointed to the north door in the aisle, and Palmer and Henslow both of
them looked very surprised and scared. After a bit, my father and
Henslow went out of the church, and the others made what haste they
could to put the slab back and plaster it in. And about as the clock
struck twelve the Cathedral was opened again and us boys made the best
of our way home.

"I was in a great taking to know what it was had given my poor father
such a turn, and when I got in and found him sitting in his chair
taking a glass of spirits, and my mother standing looking anxious at
him, I couldn't keep from bursting out and making confession where I'd
been. But he didn't seem to take on, not in the way of losing his
temper. 'You was there, was you? Well did you see it?' 'I see
everything, father,' I said, 'except when the noise came.' 'Did you
see what it was knocked the Dean over?' he says, 'that what come out
of the monument? You didn't? Well, that's a mercy.' 'Why, what was it,
father?' I said. 'Come, you must have seen it,' he says. '_Didn't_
you see? A thing like a man, all over hair, and two great eyes to it?'

"Well, that was all I could get out of him that time, and later on he
seemed as if he was ashamed of being so frightened, and he used to put
me off when I asked him about it. But years after, when I was got to
be a grown man, we had more talk now and again on the matter, and he
always said the same thing. 'Black it was,' he'd say, 'and a mass of
hair, and two legs, and the light caught on its eyes.'

"Well, that's the tale of that tomb, Mr. Lake; it's one we don't tell
to our visitors, and I should be obliged to you not to make any use of
it till I'm out of the way. I doubt Mr. Evans'll feel the same as I
do, if you ask him."

This proved to be the case. But over twenty years have passed by, and
the grass is growing over both Worby and Evans; so Mr. Lake felt no
difficulty about communicating his notes--taken in 1890--to me. He
accompanied them with a sketch of the tomb and a copy of the short
inscription on the metal cross which was affixed at the expense of Dr.
Lyall to the centre of the northern side. It was from the Vulgate of
Isaiah xxxiv., and consisted merely of the three words--

IBI CUBAVIT LAMIA.




THE STORY OF A DISAPPEARANCE
AND AN APPEARANCE




THE STORY OF A DISAPPEARANCE
AND AN APPEARANCE


The letters which I now publish were sent to me recently by a person
who knows me to be interested in ghost stories. There is no doubt
about their authenticity. The paper on which they are written, the
ink, and the whole external aspect put their date beyond the reach of
question.

The only point which they do not make clear is the identity of the
writer. He signs with initials only, and as none of the envelopes of
the letters are preserved, the surname of his correspondent--obviously
a married brother--is as obscure as his own. No further preliminary
explanation is needed, I think. Luckily the first letter supplies all
that could be expected.


LETTER I

            GREAT CHRISHALL, _Dec. 22, 1837_.

MY DEAR ROBERT,--It is with great regret for the enjoyment I am
losing, and for a reason which you will deplore equally with myself,
that I write to inform you that I am unable to join your circle for
this Christmas: but you will agree with me that it is unavoidable when
I say that I have within these few hours received a letter from Mrs.
Hunt at B----, to the effect that our Uncle Henry has suddenly and
mysteriously disappeared, and begging me to go down there immediately
and join the search that is being made for him. Little as I, or you
either, I think, have ever seen of Uncle, I naturally feel that this
is not a request that can be regarded lightly, and accordingly I
propose to go to B---- by this afternoon's mail, reaching it late in
the evening. I shall not go to the Rectory, but put up at the King's
Head, and to which you may address letters. I enclose a small draft,
which you will please make use of for the benefit of the young people.
I shall write you daily (supposing me to be detained more than a
single day) what goes on, and you may be sure, should the business be
cleared up in time to permit of my coming to the Manor after all, I
shall present myself. I have but a few minutes at disposal. With
cordial greetings to you all, and many regrets, believe me, your
affectionate Bro.,

W. R.


LETTER II

            KING'S HEAD, _Dec. 23, '37_.

MY DEAR ROBERT,--In the first place, there is as yet no news of Uncle
H., and I think you may finally dismiss any idea--I won't say
hope--that I might after all "turn up" for Xmas. However, my thoughts
will be with you, and you have my best wishes for a really festive
day. Mind that none of my nephews or nieces expend any fraction of
their guineas on presents for me.

Since I got here I have been blaming myself for taking this affair of
Uncle H. too easily. From what people here say, I gather that there is
very little hope that he can still be alive; but whether it is
accident or design that carried him off I cannot judge. The facts are
these. On Friday the 19th, he went as usual shortly before five
o'clock to read evening prayers at the Church; and when they were over
the clerk brought him a message, in response to which he set off to
pay a visit to a sick person at an outlying cottage the better part of
two miles away. He paid the visit, and started on his return journey
at about half-past six. This is the last that is known of him. The
people here are very much grieved at his loss; he had been here many
years, as you know, and though, as you also know, he was not the most
genial of men, and had more than a little of the _martinet_ in his
composition, he seems to have been active in good works, and unsparing
of trouble to himself.

Poor Mrs. Hunt, who has been his housekeeper ever since she left
Woodley, is quite overcome: it seems like the end of the world to her.
I am glad that I did not entertain the idea of taking quarters at the
Rectory; and I have declined several kindly offers of hospitality from
people in the place, preferring as I do to be independent, and finding
myself very comfortable here.

You will, of course, wish to know what has been done in the way of
inquiry and search. First, nothing was to be expected from
investigation at the Rectory; and to be brief, nothing has transpired.
I asked Mrs. Hunt--as others had done before--whether there was either
any unfavourable symptom in her master such as might portend a sudden
stroke, or attack of illness, or whether he had ever had reason to
apprehend any such thing: but both she, and also his medical man, were
clear that this was not the case. He was quite in his usual health.
In the second place, naturally, ponds and streams have been dragged,
and fields in the neighbourhood which he is known to have visited
last, have been searched--without result. I have myself talked to the
parish clerk and--more important--have been to the house where he paid
his visit.

There can be no question of any foul play on these people's part. The
one man in the house is ill in bed and very weak: the wife and the
children of course could do nothing themselves, nor is there the
shadow of a probability that they or any of them should have agreed to
decoy poor Uncle H. out in order that he might be attacked on the way
back. They had told what they knew to several other inquirers already,
but the woman repeated it to me. The Rector was looking just as usual:
he wasn't very long with the sick man--"He ain't," she said, "like
some what has a gift in prayer; but there, if we was all that way,
'owever would the chapel people get their living?" He left some money
when he went away, and one of the children saw him cross the stile
into the next field. He was dressed as he always was: wore his
bands--I gather he is nearly the last man remaining who does so--at
any rate in this district.

You see I am putting down everything. The fact is that I have nothing
else to do, having brought no business papers with me; and, moreover,
it serves to clear my own mind, and may suggest points which have been
overlooked. So I shall continue to write all that passes, even to
conversations if need be--you may read or not as you please, but pray
keep the letters. I have another reason for writing so fully, but it
is not a very tangible one.

You may ask if I have myself made any search in the fields near the
cottage. Something--a good deal--has been done by others, as I
mentioned; but I hope to go over the ground to-morrow. Bow Street has
now been informed, and will send down by to-night's coach, but I do
not think they will make much of the job. There is no snow, which
might have helped us. The fields are all grass. Of course I was on the
_qui vive_ for any indication to-day both going and returning; but
there was a thick mist on the way back, and I was not in trim for
wandering about unknown pastures, especially on an evening when bushes
looked like men, and a cow lowing in the distance might have been the
last trump. I assure you, if Uncle Henry had stepped out from among
the trees in a little copse which borders the path at one place,
carrying his head under his arm, I should have been very little more
uncomfortable than I was. To tell you the truth, I was rather
expecting something of the kind. But I must drop my pen for the
moment: Mr. Lucas, the curate, is announced.

_Later._ Mr. Lucas has been, and gone, and there is not much beyond
the decencies of ordinary sentiment to be got from him. I can see that
he has given up any idea that the Rector can be alive, and that, so
far as he can be, he is truly sorry. I can also discern that even in a
more emotional person than Mr. Lucas, Uncle Henry was not likely to
inspire strong attachment.

Besides Mr. Lucas, I have had another visitor in the shape of my
Boniface--mine host of the "King's Head"--who came to see whether I
had everything I wished, and who really requires the pen of a Boz to
do him justice. He was very solemn and weighty at first. "Well, sir,"
he said, "I suppose we must bow our 'ead beneath the blow, as my poor
wife had used to say. So far as I can gather there's been neither
hide nor yet hair of our late respected incumbent scented out as yet;
not that he was what the Scripture terms a hairy man in any sense of
the word."

I said--as well as I could--that I supposed not, but could not help
adding that I had heard he was sometimes a little difficult to deal
with. Mr. Bowman looked at me sharply for a moment, and then passed in
a flash from solemn sympathy to impassioned declamation. "When I
think," he said, "of the language that man see fit to employ to me in
this here parlour over no more a matter than a cask of beer--such a
thing as I told him might happen any day of the week to a man with a
family--though as it turned out he was quite under a mistake, and that
I knew at the time, only I was that shocked to hear him I couldn't lay
my tongue to the right expression."

He stopped abruptly and eyed me with some embarrassment. I only said,
"Dear me, I'm sorry to hear you had any little differences; I suppose
my uncle will be a good deal missed in the parish?" Mr. Bowman drew a
long breath. "Ah, yes!" he said; "your uncle! You'll understand me
when I say that for the moment it had slipped my remembrance that he
was a relative; and natural enough, I must say, as it should, for as
to you bearing any resemblance to--to him, the notion of any such a
thing is clean ridiculous. All the same, 'ad I 'ave bore it in my
mind, you'll be among the first to feel, I'm sure, as I should have
abstained my lips, or rather I should _not_ have abstained my lips
with no such reflections."

I assured him that I quite understood, and was going to have asked him
some further questions, but he was called away to see after some
business. By the way, you need not take it into your head that he has
anything to fear from the inquiry into poor Uncle Henry's
disappearance--though, no doubt, in the watches of the night it will
occur to him that _I_ think he has, and I may expect explanations
to-morrow.

I must close this letter: it has to go by the late coach.


LETTER III

            _Dec. 25, '37_.

MY DEAR ROBERT,--This is a curious letter to be writing on Christmas
Day, and yet after all there is nothing much in it. Or there may
be--you shall be the judge. At least, nothing decisive. The Bow
Street men practically say that they have no clue. The length of time
and the weather conditions have made all tracks so faint as to be
quite useless: nothing that belonged to the dead man--I'm afraid no
other word will do--has been picked up.

As I expected, Mr. Bowman was uneasy in his mind this morning; quite
early I heard him holding forth in a very distinct voice--purposely
so, I thought--to the Bow Street officers in the bar, as to the loss
that the town had sustained in their Rector, and as to the necessity
of leaving no stone unturned (he was very great on this phrase) in
order to come at the truth. I suspect him of being an orator of repute
at convivial meetings.

When I was at breakfast he came to wait on me, and took an opportunity
when handing a muffin to say in a low tone, "I 'ope, sir, you reconize
as my feelings towards your relative is not actuated by any taint of
what you may call melignity--you can leave the room, Eliza, I will see
the gentleman 'as all he requires with my own hands--I ask your
pardon, sir, but you must be well aware a man is not always master of
himself: and when that man has been 'urt in his mind by the
application of expressions which I will go so far as to say 'ad not
ought to have been made use of (his voice was rising all this time and
his face growing redder); no, sir; and 'ere, if you will permit of it,
I should like to explain to you in a very few words the exact state of
the bone of contention. This cask--I might more truly call it a
firkin--of beer--"

I felt it was time to interpose, and said that I did not see that it
would help us very much to go into that matter in detail. Mr. Bowman
acquiesced, and resumed more calmly:

"Well, sir, I bow to your ruling, and as you say, be that here or be
it there, it don't contribute a great deal, perhaps, to the present
question. All I wish you to understand is that I am prepared as you
are yourself to lend every hand to the business we have afore us,
and--as I took the opportunity to say as much to the Orficers not
three-quarters of an hour ago--to leave no stone unturned as may throw
even a spark of light on this painful matter."

In fact, Mr. Bowman did accompany us on our exploration, but though I
am sure his genuine wish was to be helpful, I am afraid he did not
contribute to the serious side of it. He appeared to be under the
impression that we were likely to meet either Uncle Henry or the
person responsible for his disappearance, walking about the
fields--and did a great deal of shading his eyes with his hand and
calling our attention, by pointing with his stick, to distant cattle
and labourers. He held several long conversations with old women whom
we met, and was very strict and severe in his manner--but on each
occasion returned to our party saying, "Well, I find she don't seem to
'ave no connexion with this sad affair. I think you may take it from
me, sir, as there's little or no light to be looked for from that
quarter; not without she's keeping somethink back intentional."

We gained no appreciable result, as I told you at starting; the Bow
Street men have left the town, whether for London or not, I am not
sure.

This evening I had company in the shape of a bagman, a smartish
fellow. He knew what was going forward, but though he has been on the
roads for some days about here, he had nothing to tell of suspicious
characters--tramps, wandering sailors or gipsies. He was very full of
a capital Punch and Judy Show he had seen this same day at W----, and
asked if it had been here yet, and advised me by no means to miss it
if it does come. The best Punch and the best Toby dog, he said, he had
ever come across. Toby dogs, you know, are the last new thing in the
shows. I have only seen one myself, but before long all the men will
have them.

Now why, you will want to know, do I trouble to write all this to you?
I am obliged to do it, because it has something to do with another
absurd trifle (as you will inevitably say), which in my present state
of rather unquiet fancy--nothing more, perhaps--I have to put down. It
is a dream, sir, which I am going to record, and I must say it is one
of the oddest I have had. Is there anything in it beyond what the
bagman's talk and Uncle Henry's disappearance could have suggested?
You, I repeat, shall judge: I am not in a sufficiently cool and
judicial frame to do so.

It began with what I can only describe as a pulling aside of curtains:
and I found myself seated in a place--I don't know whether in doors or
out. There were people--only a few--on either side of me, but I did
not recognize them, or indeed think much about them. They never spoke,
but, so far as I remember, were all grave and pale-faced and looked
fixedly before them. Facing me there was a Punch and Judy Show,
perhaps rather larger than the ordinary ones, painted with black
figures on a reddish-yellow ground. Behind it and on each side was
only darkness, but in front there was a sufficiency of light. I was
"strung up" to a high degree of expectation and listened every moment
to hear the panpipes and the Roo-too-too-it. Instead of that there
came suddenly an enormous--I can use no other word--an enormous single
toll of a bell, I don't know from how far off--somewhere behind. The
little curtain flew up and the drama began.

I believe someone once tried to re-write Punch as a serious tragedy;
but whoever he may have been, this performance would have suited him
exactly. There was something Satanic about the hero. He varied his
methods of attack: for some of his victims he lay in wait, and to see
his horrible face--it was yellowish white, I may remark--peering round
the wings made me think of the Vampyre in Fuseli's foul sketch. To
others he was polite and carneying--particularly to the unfortunate
alien who can only say _Shallabalah_--though what Punch said I never
could catch. But with all of them I came to dread the moment of death.
The crack of the stick on their skulls, which in the ordinary way
delights me, had here a crushing sound as if the bone was giving way,
and the victims quivered and kicked as they lay. The baby--it sounds
more ridiculous as I go on--the baby, I am sure, was alive. Punch
wrung its neck, and if the choke or squeak which it gave were not
real, I know nothing of reality.

The stage got perceptibly darker as each crime was consummated, and at
last there was one murder which was done quite in the dark, so that I
could see nothing of the victim, and took some time to effect. It was
accompanied by hard breathing and horrid muffled sounds, and after it
Punch came and sat on the foot-board and fanned himself and looked at
his shoes, which were bloody, and hung his head on one side, and
sniggered in so deadly a fashion that I saw some of those beside me
cover their faces, and I would gladly have done the same. But in the
meantime the scene behind Punch was clearing, and showed, not the
usual house front, but something more ambitious--a grove of trees and
the gentle slope of a hill, with a very natural--in fact, I should say
a real--moon shining on it. Over this there rose slowly an object
which I soon perceived to be a human figure with something peculiar
about the head--what, I was unable at first to see. It did not stand
on its feet, but began creeping or dragging itself across the middle
distance towards Punch, who still sat back to it; and by this time, I
may remark (though it did not occur to me at the moment) that all
pretence of this being a puppet show had vanished. Punch was still
Punch, it is true, but, like the others, was in some sense a live
creature, and both moved themselves at their own will.

When I next glanced at him he was sitting in malignant reflection; but
in another instant something seemed to attract his attention, and he
first sat up sharply and then turned round, and evidently caught sight
of the person that was approaching him and was in fact now very near.
Then, indeed, did he show unmistakable signs of terror: catching up
his stick, he rushed towards the wood, only just eluding the arm of
his pursuer, which was suddenly flung out to intercept him. It was
with a revulsion which I cannot easily express that I now saw more or
less clearly what this pursuer was like. He was a sturdy figure clad
in black, and, as I thought, wearing bands: his head was covered with
a whitish bag.

The chase which now began lasted I do not know how long, now among the
trees, now along the slope of the field, sometimes both figures
disappearing wholly for a few seconds, and only some uncertain sounds
letting one know that they were still afoot. At length there came a
moment when Punch, evidently exhausted, staggered in from the left and
threw himself down among the trees. His pursuer was not long after
him, and came looking uncertainly from side to side. Then, catching
sight of the figure on the ground, he too threw himself down--his back
was turned to the audience--with a swift motion twitched the covering
from his head, and thrust his face into that of Punch. Everything on
the instant grew dark.

There was one long, loud, shuddering scream, and I awoke to find
myself looking straight into the face of--what in all the world do you
think?--but a large owl, which was seated on my window-sill
immediately opposite my bed-foot, holding up its wings like two
shrouded arms. I caught the fierce glance of its yellow eyes, and then
it was gone. I heard the single enormous bell again--very likely, as
you are saying to yourself, the church clock; but I do not think
so--and then I was broad awake.

All this, I may say, happened within the last half-hour. There was no
probability of my getting to sleep again, so I got up, put on clothes
enough to keep me warm, and am writing this rigmarole in the first
hours of Christmas Day. Have I left out anything? Yes, there was no
Toby dog, and the names over the front of the Punch and Judy booth
were Kidman and Gallop, which were certainly not what the bagman told
me to look out for.

By this time, I feel a little more as if I could sleep, so this shall
be sealed and wafered.


LETTER IV

            _Dec. 26, '37._

MY DEAR ROBERT,--All is over. The body has been found. I do not make
excuses for not having sent off my news by last night's mail, for the
simple reason that I was incapable of putting pen to paper. The events
that attended the discovery bewildered me so completely that I needed
what I could get of a night's rest to enable me to face the situation
at all. Now I can give you my journal of the day, certainly the
strangest Christmas Day that ever I spent or am likely to spend.

The first incident was not very serious. Mr. Bowman had, I think, been
keeping Christmas Eve, and was a little inclined to be captious: at
least, he was not on foot very early, and to judge from what I could
hear, neither men or maids could do anything to please him. The latter
were certainly reduced to tears; nor am I sure that Mr. Bowman
succeeded in preserving a manly composure. At any rate, when I came
downstairs, it was in a broken voice that he wished me the compliments
of the season, and a little later on, when he paid his visit of
ceremony at breakfast, he was far from cheerful: even Byronic, I might
almost say, in his outlook on life.

"I don't know," he said, "if you think with me, sir; but every
Christmas as comes round the world seems a hollerer thing to me. Why,
take an example now from what lays under my own eye. There's my
servant Eliza--been with me now for going on fifteen years. I thought
I could have placed my confidence in Elizar, and yet this very
morning--Christmas morning too, of all the blessed days in the
year--with the bells a ringing and--and--all like that--I say, this
very morning, had it not have been for Providence watching over us
all, that girl would have put--indeed I may go so far to say, 'ad put
the cheese on your breakfast table----" He saw I was about to speak,
and waved his hand at me. "It's all very well for you to say, 'Yes,
Mr. Bowman, but you took away the cheese and locked it up in the
cupboard,' which I did, and have the key here, or if not the actual
key one very much about the same size. That's true enough, sir, but
what do you think is the effect of that action on me? Why it's no
exaggeration for me to say that the ground is cut from under my feet.
And yet when I said as much to Eliza, not nasty, mind you, but just
firm like, what was my return? 'Oh,' she says: 'Well,' she says,
'there wasn't no bones broke, I suppose.' Well, sir, it 'urt me,
that's all I can say: it 'urt me, and I don't like to think of it
now."

There was an ominous pause here, in which I ventured to say something
like, "Yes, very trying," and then asked at what hour the church
service was to be. "Eleven o'clock," Mr. Bowman said with a heavy
sigh. "Ah, you won't have no such discourse from poor Mr. Lucas as
what you would have done from our late Rector. Him and me may have
had our little differences, and did do, more's the pity."

I could see that a powerful effort was needed to keep him off the
vexed question of the cask of beer, but he made it. "But I will say
this, that a better preacher, nor yet one to stand faster by his
rights, or what he considered to be his rights--however, that's not
the question now--I for one, never set under. Some might say, 'Was he
a eloquent man?' and to that my answer would be: 'Well, there you've a
better right per'aps to speak of your own uncle than what I have.'
Others might ask, 'Did he keep a hold of his congregation?' and there
again I should reply, 'That depends.' But as I say--Yes, Eliza, my
girl, I'm coming--eleven o'clock, sir, and you inquire for the King's
Head pew." I believe Eliza had been very near the door, and shall
consider it in my vail.

The next episode was church: I felt Mr. Lucas had a difficult task in
doing justice to Christmas sentiments, and also to the feeling of
disquiet and regret which, whatever Mr. Bowman might say, was clearly
prevalent. I do not think he rose to the occasion. I was
uncomfortable. The organ wolved--you know what I mean: the wind
died--twice in the Christmas Hymn, and the tenor bell, I suppose owing
to some negligence on the part of the ringers, kept sounding faintly
about once in a minute during the sermon. The clerk sent up a man to
see to it, but he seemed unable to do much. I was glad when it was
over. There was an odd incident, too, before the service. I went in
rather early, and came upon two men carrying the parish bier back to
its place under the tower. From what I overheard them saying, it
appeared that it had been put out by mistake, by some one who was not
there. I also saw the clerk busy folding up a moth-eaten velvet
pall--not a sight for Christmas Day.

I dined soon after this, and then, feeling disinclined to go out, took
my seat by the fire in the parlour, with the last number of
_Pickwick_, which I had been saving up for some days. I thought I
could be sure of keeping awake over this, but I turned out as bad as
our friend Smith. I suppose it was half-past two when I was roused by
a piercing whistle and laughing and talking voices outside in the
market-place. It was a Punch and Judy--I had no doubt the one that my
bagman had seen at W----. I was half delighted, half not--the latter
because my unpleasant dream came back to me so vividly; but, anyhow, I
determined to see it through, and I sent Eliza out with a crown-piece
to the performers and a request that they would face my window if they
could manage it.

The show was a very smart new one; the names of the proprietors, I
need hardly tell you, were Italian, Foresta and Calpigi. The Toby dog
was there, as I had been led to expect. All B---- turned out, but did
not obstruct my view, for I was at the large first-floor window and
not ten yards away.

The play began on the stroke of a quarter to three by the church
clock. Certainly it was very good; and I was soon relieved to find
that the disgust my dream had given me for Punch's onslaughts on his
ill-starred visitors was only transient. I laughed at the demise of
the Turncock, the Foreigner, the Beadle, and even the baby. The only
drawback was the Toby dog's developing a tendency to howl in the wrong
place. Something had occurred, I suppose, to upset him, and something
considerable: for, I forget exactly at what point, he gave a most
lamentable cry, leapt off the foot board, and shot away across the
market-place and down a side street. There was a stage-wait, but only
a brief one. I suppose the men decided that it was no good going after
him, and that he was likely to turn up again at night.

We went on. Punch dealt faithfully with Judy, and in fact with all
comers; and then came the moment when the gallows was erected, and the
great scene with Mr. Ketch was to be enacted. It was now that
something happened of which I can certainly not yet see the import
fully. You have witnessed an execution, and know what the criminal's
head looks like with the cap on. If you are like me, you never wish to
think of it again, and I do not willingly remind you of it. It was
just such a head as that, that I, from my somewhat higher post, saw in
the inside of the show-box; but at first the audience did not see it.
I expected it to emerge into their view, but instead of that there
slowly rose for a few seconds an uncovered face, with an expression of
terror upon it, of which I have never imagined the like. It seemed as
if the man, whoever he was, was being forcibly lifted, with his arms
somehow pinioned or held back, towards the little gibbet on the
stage. I could just see the nightcapped head behind him. Then there
was a cry and a crash. The whole show-box fell over backwards; kicking
legs were seen among the ruins, and then two figures--as some said; I
can only answer for one--were visible running at top speed across the
square and disappearing in a lane which leads to the fields.

Of course everybody gave chase. I followed; but the pace was killing,
and very few were in, literally, at the death. It happened in a chalk
pit: the man went over the edge quite blindly and broke his neck. They
searched everywhere for the other, until it occurred to me to ask
whether he had ever left the market-place. At first everyone was sure
that he had; but when we came to look, he was there, under the
show-box, dead too.

But in the chalk pit it was that poor Uncle Henry's body was found,
with a sack over the head, the throat horribly mangled. It was a
peaked corner of the sack sticking out of the soil that attracted
attention. I cannot bring myself to write in greater detail.

I forgot to say the men's real names were Kidman and Gallop. I feel
sure I have heard them, but no one here seems to know anything about
them.

I am coming to you as soon as I can after the funeral. I must tell you
when we meet what I think of it all.




TWO DOCTORS




TWO DOCTORS


It is a very common thing, in my experience, to find papers shut up in
old books; but one of the rarest things to come across any such that
are at all interesting. Still it does happen, and one should never
destroy them unlooked at. Now it was a practice of mine before the war
occasionally to buy old ledgers of which the paper was good, and which
possessed a good many blank leaves, and to extract these and use them
for my own notes and writings. One such I purchased for a small sum in
1911. It was tightly clasped, and its boards were warped by having for
years been obliged to embrace a number of extraneous sheets.
Three-quarters of this inserted matter had lost all vestige of
importance for any living human being: one bundle had not. That it
belonged to a lawyer is certain, for it is endorsed: _The strangest
case I have yet met_, and bears initials, and an address in Gray's
Inn. It is only materials for a case, and consists of statements by
possible witnesses. The man who would have been the defendant or
prisoner seems never to have appeared. The _dossier_ is not complete,
but, such as it is, it furnishes a riddle in which the supernatural
appears to play a part. You must see what you can make of it.

The following is the setting and the tale as I elicit it.

Dr. Abell was walking in his garden one afternoon waiting for his
horse to be brought round that he might set out on his visits for the
day. As the place was Islington, the month June, and the year 1718, we
conceive the surroundings as being countrified and pleasant. To him
entered his confidential servant, Luke Jennett, who had been with him
twenty years.

"I said I wished to speak to him, and what I had to say might take
some quarter of an hour. He accordingly bade me go into his study,
which was a room opening on the terrace path where he was walking, and
came in himself and sat down. I told him that, much against my will, I
must look out for another place. He inquired what was my reason, in
consideration I had been so long with him. I said if he would excuse
me he would do me a great kindness, because (this appears to have
been common form even in 1718) I was one that always liked to have
everything pleasant about me. As well as I can remember, he said that
was his case likewise, but he would wish to know why I should change
my mind after so many years, and, says he, 'you know there can be no
talk of a remembrance of you in my will if you leave my service now.'
I said I had made my reckoning of that.

"'Then,' says he, 'you must have some complaint to make, and if I
could I would willingly set it right.' And at that I told him, not
seeing how I could keep it back, the matter of my former affidavit and
of the bedstaff in the dispensing-room, and said that a house where
such things happened was no place for me. At which he, looking very
black upon me, said no more, but called me fool, and said he would pay
what was owing me in the morning; and so, his horse being waiting,
went out. So for that night I lodged with my sister's husband near
Battle Bridge and came early next morning to my late master, who then
made a great matter that I had not lain in his house and stopped a
crown out of my wages owing.

"After that I took service here and there, not for long at a time,
and saw no more of him till I came to be Dr. Quinn's man at Dodds Hall
in Islington."

There is one very obscure part in this statement, namely, the
reference to the former affidavit and the matter of the bedstaff. The
former affidavit is not in the bundle of papers. It is to be feared
that it was taken out to be read because of its special oddity, and
not put back. Of what nature the story was may be guessed later, but
as yet no clue has been put into our hands.

The Rector of Islington, Jonathan Pratt, is the next to step forward.
He furnishes particulars of the standing and reputation of Dr. Abell
and Dr. Quinn, both of whom lived and practised in his parish.

"It is not to be supposed," he says, "that a physician should be a
regular attendant at morning and evening prayers, or at the Wednesday
lectures, but within the measure of their ability I would say that
both these persons fulfilled their obligations as loyal members of the
Church of England. At the same time (as you desire my private mind) I
must say, in the language of the schools, _distinguo_. Dr. A. was to
me a source of perplexity, Dr. Q. to my eye a plain, honest believer,
not inquiring over closely into points of belief, but squaring his
practice to what lights he had. The other interested himself in
questions to which Providence, as I hold, designs no answer to be
given us in this state: he would ask me, for example, what place I
believed those beings now to hold in the scheme of creation which by
some are thought neither to have stood fast when the rebel angels
fell, nor to have joined with them to the full pitch of their
transgression.

"As was suitable, my first answer to him was a question, What warrant
he had for supposing any such beings to exist? for that there was none
in Scripture I took it he was aware. It appeared--for as I am on the
subject, the whole tale may be given--that he grounded himself on such
passages as that of the satyr which Jerome tells us conversed with
Antony; but thought too that some parts of Scripture might be cited in
support. 'And besides,' said he, 'you know 'tis the universal belief
among those that spend their days and nights abroad, and I would add
that if your calling took you so continuously as it does me about the
country lanes by night, you might not be so surprised as I see you to
be by my suggestion.' 'You are then of John Milton's mind,' I said,
'and hold that

    Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
    Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.'

"'I do not know,' he said, 'why Milton should take upon himself to say
"unseen"; though to be sure he was blind when he wrote that. But for
the rest, why, yes, I think he was in the right.' 'Well,' I said,
'though not so often as you, I am not seldom called abroad pretty
late; but I have no mind of meeting a satyr in our Islington lanes in
all the years I have been here; and if you have had the better luck, I
am sure the Royal Society would be glad to know of it.'

"I am reminded of these trifling expressions because Dr. A. took them
so ill, stamping out of the room in a huff with some such word as that
these high and dry parsons had no eyes but for a prayerbook or a pint
of wine.

"But this was not the only time that our conversation took a
remarkable turn. There was an evening when he came in, at first
seeming gay and in good spirits, but afterwards as he sat and smoked
by the fire falling into a musing way; out of which to rouse him I
said pleasantly that I supposed he had had no meetings of late with
his odd friends. A question which did effectually arouse him, for he
looked most wildly, and as if scared, upon me, and said, '_You_ were
never there? I did not see you. Who brought you?' And then in a more
collected tone, 'What was this about a meeting? I believe I must have
been in a doze.' To which I answered that I was thinking of fauns and
centaurs in the dark lane, and not of a witches' Sabbath; but it
seemed he took it differently.

"'Well,' said he, 'I can plead guilty to neither; but I find you very
much more of a sceptic than becomes your cloth. If you care to know
about the dark lane you might do worse than ask my housekeeper that
lived at the other end of it when she was a child.' 'Yes,' said I,
'and the old women in the almshouse and the children in the kennel. If
I were you, I would send to your brother Quinn for a bolus to clear
your brain.' 'Damn Quinn,' says he; 'talk no more of him: he has
embezzled four of my best patients this month; I believe it is that
cursed man of his, Jennett, that used to be with me, his tongue is
never still; it should be nailed to the pillory if he had his
deserts.' This, I may say, was the only time of his showing me that he
had any grudge against either Dr. Quinn or Jennett, and as was my
business, I did my best to persuade him he was mistaken in them. Yet
it could not be denied that some respectable families in the parish
had given him the cold shoulder, and for no reason that they were
willing to allege. The end was that he said he had not done so ill at
Islington but that he could afford to live at ease elsewhere when he
chose, and anyhow he bore Dr. Quinn no malice. I think I now remember
what observation of mine drew him into the train of thought which he
next pursued. It was, I believe, my mentioning some juggling tricks
which my brother in the East Indies had seen at the court of the Rajah
of Mysore. 'A convenient thing enough,' said Dr. Abell to me, 'if by
some arrangement a man could get the power of communicating motion and
energy to inanimate objects.' 'As if the axe should move itself
against him that lifts it; something of that kind?' 'Well, I don't
know that that was in my mind so much; but if you could summon such a
volume from your shelf or even order it to open at the right page.'

"He was sitting by the fire--it was a cold evening--and stretched out
his hand that way, and just then the fire-irons, or at least the
poker, fell over towards him with a great clatter, and I did not hear
what else he said. But I told him that I could not easily conceive of
an arrangement, as he called it, of such a kind that would not include
as one of its conditions a heavier payment than any Christian would
care to make; to which he assented. 'But,' he said, 'I have no doubt
these bargains can be made very tempting, very persuasive. Still, you
would not favour them, eh, Doctor? No, I suppose not.'

"This is as much as I know of Dr. Abell's mind, and the feeling
between these men. Dr. Quinn, as I said, was a plain, honest creature,
and a man to whom I would have gone--indeed I have before now gone to
him for advice on matters of business. He was, however, every now and
again, and particularly of late, not exempt from troublesome fancies.
There was certainly a time when he was so much harassed by his dreams
that he could not keep them to himself, but would tell them to his
acquaintances and among them to me. I was at supper at his house, and
he was not inclined to let me leave him at my usual time. 'If you
go,' he said, 'there will be nothing for it but I must go to bed and
dream of the chrysalis.' 'You might be worse off,' said I. 'I do not
think it,' he said, and he shook himself like a man who is displeased
with the complexion of his thoughts. 'I only meant,' said I, 'that a
chrysalis is an innocent thing.' 'This one is not,' he said, 'and I do
not care to think of it.'

"However, sooner than lose my company he was fain to tell me (for I
pressed him) that this was a dream which had come to him several times
of late, and even more than once in a night. It was to this effect,
that he seemed to himself to wake under an extreme compulsion to rise
and go out of doors. So he would dress himself and go down to his
garden door. By the door there stood a spade which he must take, and
go out into the garden, and at a particular place in the shrubbery
somewhat clear and upon which the moon shone, for there was always in
his dream a full moon, he would feel himself forced to dig. And after
some time the spade would uncover something light-coloured, which he
would perceive to be a stuff, linen or woollen, and this he must clear
with his hands. It was always the same: of the size of a man and
shaped like the chrysalis of a moth, with the folds showing a promise
of an opening at one end.

"He could not describe how gladly he would have left all at this stage
and run to the house, but he must not escape so easily. So with many
groans, and knowing only too well what to expect, he parted these
folds of stuff, or, as it sometimes seemed to be, membrane, and
disclosed a head covered with a smooth pink skin, which breaking as
the creature stirred, showed him his own face in a state of death. The
telling of this so much disturbed him that I was forced out of mere
compassion to sit with him the greater part of the night and talk with
him upon indifferent subjects. He said that upon every recurrence of
this dream he woke and found himself, as it were, fighting for his
breath."

Another extract from Luke Jennett's long continuous statement comes in
at this point.

"I never told tales of my master, Dr. Abell, to anybody in the
neighbourhood. When I was in another service I remember to have spoken
to my fellow-servants about the matter of the bedstaff, but I am sure
I never said either I or he were the persons concerned, and it met
with so little credit that I was affronted and thought best to keep it
to myself. And when I came back to Islington and found Dr. Abell still
there, who I was told had left the parish, I was clear that it behoved
me to use great discretion, for indeed I was afraid of the man, and it
is certain I was no party to spreading any ill report of him. My
master, Dr. Quinn, was a very just, honest man, and no maker of
mischief. I am sure he never stirred a finger nor said a word by way
of inducement to a soul to make them leave going to Dr. Abell and come
to him; nay, he would hardly be persuaded to attend them that came,
until he was convinced that if he did not they would send into the
town for a physician rather than do as they had hitherto done.

"I believe it may be proved that Dr. Abell came into my master's house
more than once. We had a new chambermaid out of Hertfordshire, and she
asked me who was the gentleman that was looking after the master, that
is Dr. Quinn, when he was out, and seemed so disappointed that he was
out. She said whoever he was he knew the way of the house well,
running at once into the study and then into the dispensing-room, and
last into the bed-chamber. I made her tell me what he was like, and
what she said was suitable enough to Dr. Abell; but besides she told
me she saw the same man at church and some one told her that was the
Doctor.

"It was just after this that my master began to have his bad nights,
and complained to me and other persons, and in particular what
discomfort he suffered from his pillow and bedclothes. He said he must
buy some to suit him, and should do his own marketing. And accordingly
brought home a parcel which he said was of the right quality, but
where he bought it we had then no knowledge, only they were marked in
thread with a coronet and a bird. The women said they were of a sort
not commonly met with and very fine, and my master said they were the
comfortablest he ever used, and he slept now both soft and deep. Also
the feather pillows were the best sorted and his head would sink into
them as if they were a cloud: which I have myself remarked several
times when I came to wake him of a morning, his face being almost hid
by the pillow closing over it.

"I had never any communication with Dr. Abell after I came back to
Islington, but one day when he passed me in the street and asked me
whether I was not looking for another service, to which I answered I
was very well suited where I was, but he said I was a fickle-minded
fellow and he doubted not he should soon hear I was on the world
again, which indeed proved true."

Dr. Pratt is next taken up where he left off.

"On the 16th I was called up out of my bed soon after it was
light--that is about five--with a message that Dr. Quinn was dead or
dying. Making my way to his house I found there was no doubt which was
the truth. All the persons in the house except the one that let me in
were already in his chamber and standing about his bed, but none
touching him. He was stretched in the midst of the bed, on his back,
without any disorder, and indeed had the appearance of one ready laid
out for burial. His hands, I think, were even crossed on his breast.
The only thing not usual was that nothing was to be seen of his face,
the two ends of the pillow or bolster appearing to be closed quite
over it. These I immediately pulled apart, at the same time rebuking
those present, and especially the man, for not at once coming to the
assistance of his master. He, however, only looked at me and shook
his head, having evidently no more hope than myself that there was
anything but a corpse before us.

"Indeed it was plain to any one possessed of the least experience that
he was not only dead, but had died of suffocation. Nor could it be
conceived that his death was accidentally caused by the mere folding
of the pillow over his face. How should he not, feeling the
oppression, have lifted his hands to put it away? whereas not a fold
of the sheet which was closely gathered about him, as I now observed,
was disordered. The next thing was to procure a physician. I had
bethought me of this on leaving my house, and sent on the messenger
who had come to me to Dr. Abell; but I now heard that he was away from
home, and the nearest surgeon was got, who however could tell no more,
at least without opening the body, than we already knew.

"As to any person entering the room with evil purpose (which was the
next point to be cleared), it was visible that the bolts of the door
were burst from their stanchions, and the stanchions broken away from
the door-post by main force; and there was a sufficient body of
witness, the smith among them, to testify that this had been done but
a few minutes before I came. The chamber being moreover at the top of
the house, the window was neither easy of access nor did it show any
sign of an exit made that way, either by marks upon the sill or
footprints below upon soft mould."

The surgeon's evidence forms of course part of the report of the
inquest, but since it has nothing but remarks upon the healthy state
of the larger organs and the coagulation of blood in various parts of
the body, it need not be reproduced. The verdict was "Death by the
visitation of God."

Annexed to the other papers is one which I was at first inclined to
suppose had made its way among them by mistake. Upon further
consideration I think I can divine a reason for its presence.

It relates to the rifling of a mausoleum in Middlesex which stood in a
park (now broken up), the property of a noble family which I will not
name. The outrage was not that of an ordinary resurrection man. The
object, it seemed likely, was theft. The account is blunt and
terrible. I shall not quote it. A dealer in the North of London
suffered heavy penalties as a receiver of stolen goods in connexion
with the affair.
