    "We love horror, so we decided to explore Elliott O’Donnell’s books. We know a little bit more about him because of project one, but we want to learn more about his legacy. We think his writing may have more negative connotations compared to other horror novels before his time. He often uses his personal ghost-hunting experiences, which might make his stories feel less active by inciting the use of negative and possibly aggressive tones."

O’Donnell might not be as famous today, but his works were popular back then and could have influenced many writers. We also believe that O’Donnell’s writings might be scarier and have more negative emotions and connotations than other popular horror writers before him due to the idea that he may have had inspiration from those authors."

The other consists of Horror stories about, ghosts, spirits, or paranormal before Elliots O'Donnell's time dating as far back as 1812 with Charles Dickens, this corpus contained around 200 works. We limited the horror story data to those who covered similar subjects, to eliminate some independence, as well as limiting it to those who were born before him, leaving us with those who wrote about horror who are older than O’Donnell. Keeping these corpora separate allows us to visualize their sentiment data more easily."

For example, a high score indicates strong positive feelings, while a low score reflects strong negative feelings, helping readers grasp the intended emotions behind the text. \n",

    "We focused on making the map more informative and visually appealing. We filtered the location count to greater than 3 to ensure more specific and relevant results.  This helped eliminate outliers and provide a clearer view of significant data points. We also changed the map colors to an \"ice and fire\" theme, which enhanced readability by using contrasting colors to differentiate between various data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we adjusted the map zoom and centered it to highlight areas of interest effectively. The story the map tells is one of diversity in writing styles. Odonnell stands out with a less neutral score compared to other artists, showcasing higher highs and lower lows. This suggests that Odonnell's writing is more emotionally intense and varied. Moreover, the scattered nature of Odonnell's data points implies a broader range of topics and themes explored in his work, setting him apart from his peers.\n"

    "I figured Elliott O'Donnells works would be mostly negative since he had previous authors before him to review and perfect his horror abilities. However, after running the codes I now understand that O'Donnells works were more neutral because his stories were more basic, which means he did not have that horror effect in his stories as other authors. We all stumbled to run certain codes, even if someone else could and we still don't know why this issue occured. We tried a lot of different methods, including trying each other's codes and even going through old lessons to see if we were missing certain data packs. If I had more time to go through and process the data. We all could have found a way for everything to run smoothly and we could have redesigned the code to find authors before and after O'Donnell to get a deeper analysis of his works.\n",
