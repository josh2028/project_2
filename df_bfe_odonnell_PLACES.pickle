All afternoon the air got heavier and heavier with the Sirocco that was
without doubt coming up from the south, and that night again I went up
to bed feeling very sleepy; but below my drowsiness, so to speak, there
was the consciousness, stronger than before, that there was something
wrong in the house, that something dangerous was close at hand.”ŒÚ*       *       *       *       *

Six months later I met Mrs Stanley in a country house in England.”ŒZ*       *       *       *       *

The book is in the Wentworth Collection at Cambridge.”XR  *       *       *       *       *

The sequel can be made short; indeed, some of my readers have perhaps
already guessed what it was, if they remember that inexplicable affair
of the churchyard at West Fawley, some eight years ago, where an attempt
was made three times to bury the body of a certain woman who had
committed suicide.”Œƒ*       *       *       *       *

â€œAfter I returned from Paris, where I had studied under Charcot, I set
up practice at home.”XU  * * * * *

The gloomy half-lighted chamber in which this scene took place, and
where the dead girl lay, looking so sweetly placid in her coffin, was
one of those, where, in conformity with the police regulations of
Germany in general, the bodies of persons deceased are placed within
twelve hours after death--there to await interment.”ŒÖ[G]

That the Banshee is not confined within the geographical limits of
Ireland, but that she can follow the fortunes of a family abroad, and
there foretell their death, is clearly shown by the following story.”Œs[_aside._]  The Duke of Milan
    And his more braver daughter could control thee,
    If now 'twere fit to do't.”ŒÁ[A] In any case, his mind was made up; that book must return to
Cambridge with him, even if he had to draw the whole of his balance from
the bank and stay at St. Bertrand till the money came.”Œš"After that I took service here and there, not for long at a time,
and saw no more of him till I came to be Dr. Quinn's man at Dodds Hall
in Islington."”Œ7"And we do have some things so much better in America!"”Œ\"But you said it _used_ to haunt the little old house at Salem, so I
supposed it had moved.”ŒJ"Did the ghost leave Scotland for America as soon as the old baron
died?"”ŒŒ"En rakasta riitaa, Pollock, sen tiedÃ¤t, mutta onhan

not finding a ghost in that old castle, which was said to be haunted by
a headless apparition?”Œu"He talked the wraith of the Duncans and the
specter of the little old house at Salem into a matrimonial engagement.”X]  "His chambers being afterwards stripp'd, Mr. Casbury came by
     part of the hangings of it, which 'twas said this Charlett
     had design'd expressly for a memoriall of his Hair, giving
     the Fellow that drew it a lock to work by, and the piece
     which I have fasten'd in here was parcel of the same, which
     Mr. Casbury gave to me.”Œ"I have been with Hugh."”Œ‹"I mean," said Leb, in a most sympathetic manner, approaching still
nearer to Selde, "that maybe you had to make your daughter marry him."”ŒZ"I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on
the Elysium road?"”Œ"I was married in India."”ŒÜ"In those days," she began, feeling from the quality of our silence that
we were with her, "in those days I was interested in psychic things, and
had arranged to sit up alone in a haunted house in the middle of London.”ŒÙ"Jos pÃ¤Ã¤ni olisi murskautunut sormieni sijasta, niin kenties siitÃ¤

looking out of the window in their house at Blackrock, near Cork.”ŒÙ"My sweetest Emily will be rejoiced to hear that we are at length--my
beloved uncle and myself--settled in the house that now calls us
master--nay, master and mistress--as in past ages it has called so
many others.”ŒÛ"NÃ¤en yhtÃ¤mittaa tuon roiston ylÃ¶salasin

you come back?"”Œ"Oh, Hugh, darling!"”Œ"Oh, Hugh, speak to me!”Œë"Old Mr. Casbury, of Acrington, told me this day much of
     young Sir Everard Charlett, whom he remember'd Commoner of
     University College, and thought was of the same Family as
     Dr. Arthur Charlett, now master of ye Coll.”Œ§"Once upon a time," began Uncle Larry--"in fact, a very few years
ago--there lived in the thriving town of New York a young American
called Duncan--Eliphalet Duncan.”ŒN"Otaksukaamme, ettÃ¤ joku vÃ¤kevÃ¤ rapuelÃ¤in kietoutuisi

old Judge Sutton, of the firm of Pixley and Sutton."”X0  "So you got up and saw the sunrise over the bay," said Dear Jones, "with
the electric lights of the city twinkling in the distance, and the first
faint flush of the dawn in the east just over Fort Lafayette, and the
rosy tinge which spread softly upward, and----"

"Did you both come back together?"”Œb"So, besides being the owner of a haunted house in Salem, he was also a
haunted man in Scotland?"”Œ("That's what give it the name of morgue.”ŒÃ"The Man Who Went Too Far" is of intense
interest as an attempt to bring into our own times an interpretation of
the symbolism underlying Greek mythology, applied to England of some
years ago.”Œ¹"The next morning," continued Uncle Larry, "Eliphalet overslept
himself, and when he went down to a late breakfast he found that the
Suttons had gone to New York by the morning train.”ŒB"This little old house at Salem was haunted," resumed Uncle Larry.”Œ"Toimimaan

nicer than you can get them in Europe--especially ice-cream."”•4      Œb"Well, by telling him foolish tales
I had picked up in Ireland of what we call the second sight."”Œ­"While I do not wish to be classed as a believer in Spiritualism, I
certainly am open to conviction after what has come under my personal
observation," Dr. Funk concluded.”Œc"Why, then, did you shriek so, Selde," called out one of the guests to
her, "if nothing happened?"”ŒÌ"Why, you know our
ignorant people pretend that some are able to foresee what is to
come--sometimes in a glass, or in the air, maybe, and at Kildonan we
had an old woman that pretended to such a power.”Œ³'"Surely her mamma will have some pity upon her," continued Herminia;
"the Baron GrÃ¼nthal has returned to Aix, and though his gout still
continues----"'

'Praised be Plutus!'”Œ!'A passage in Herminia's letter.'”Œ`'Ach Gott--yes,' said Rhineberg; 'it is certainly a great calamity
even to the city of Aachen.'”X)  'And of the 95th Thuringians in particular,' added the young Count,
laughing; 'to-morrow we shall start for Frankenburg in an open
britzka--it is only twenty-five miles from this; and now, one bottle
more of St. Julian, and then we shall go and see the girls at the
gardens of the Prinz Carl.'”Œs'And our infernal Baron--no doubt he was at Frankenburg to-day,
hoping to play the lover,' said Charlie viciously.”Œ'And the Grafine Herminia?'”ŒS'Because Herminia, in the very spirit of opposition, may fall in love
with _him_.'”Œ3'But a boy--a mere boy--to be brought into action!'”Œ™'But my cousin--this most odious _fiancÃ©_--Heinrich von Frankenburg,
joins us in a week from Potsdam, where, I understand, his regiment is
stationed.'”ŒS'But of course you could not, for I have just come from the city,'
said Rhineberg.”Œ'But oh, Herminia!'”ŒX'Did he want it when you were in your cradle, and he was carrying his
satchel at Bonn?'”Œ7'Did you ever _go_ to Burtscheid with Herr Pierrepont?'”ŒŠ'Do not speak thus, I implore you,' said Herminia, passionately, and
somewhat scared by her cousin's tone of voice and expression of eye.”ŒB'Do you, Grafine, wish to abet Herminia in her strange contumacy?'”Œ†'Ernestine, meine liebe,' the Countess would say from time to time,
'attend to the Herr Baron--assist him with your own pretty hands.”X6  'Ernestine,' said Herminia reproachfully, while she glanced nervously
at the portly figure of her uncle, who was still watching the Aix
road from the lofty terrace, where the box-trees were cut into
strange and fantastic shapes, like lions and egg-cups, and where some
stately peacocks strutted to and fro.”Œ'Forgive me, Herminia.”Œ-'Go in, Spearman, and tell us what you find.'”Œ:'He certainly seems to have impressed you,' said Herminia.”Xm  'He has never suffered more, I think,' said Rhineberg, after taking a
long pull at his pipe, and watching the smoke thoughtfully as it
ascended in concentric rings towards the lofty ceiling of the
speise-saal, 'never, since that morning when the devilish _Extra
Blatt_ had in it the mutilated telegram concerning the capture of
Heinrich by the Francs-Tireurs.'”ŒF'Heinrich tells me he is poor,' was the suggestive remark of Herminia.”X  'Her father, the Staats Rath, gave her away to him as a child; but
you, as well as I do, know the arrangement made by our family; they
were betrothed when she was in her cradle, and he a schoolboy at
Bonn; and now he comes to claim her hand, in virtue of that
betrothal,' added the Countess, who, though a German, had
considerable nobility and dignity in her bearing and aspect.”ŒÅ'Here is my contribution to the repast,' said Heinrich, producing
from his tent a square case bottle of prime Geneva 'per Johann de
Kuy, Rotterdam,' which he had picked up somewhere on the march.”Œ:'Herminia writes, "Poor Ernestine seems to fret fearfully.”Œ
'Herminia!'”Œ'Herminia, dearest, look up!”ŒÎ'Herminia, dearest,' said the young man, while gazing at her
lovingly, earnestly, and very keenly, 'you have never seen this
wondrous cousin, to whom your family wish to assign you like a bale
of goods?'”Œ3'Herminia, do you really think so, or do you jest?'”Œƒ'Herminia,' said the Countess, with increasing severity, 'do you
revere the memory of the Baron and Privy Councillor your father?'”Œž'I always thought,' she continued, in the same low and certainly
agitated voice, 'that you preferred my society to that of Herminia or
the Rhineberg girls.'”Œ•'I declare, Herminia, I _do_ think I am pretty,' said she, suddenly
pausing and surveying herself in her laced night-robe in the long
cheval glass.”Œí'I fear, Carl, that I am looking ill and pale,' she continued, 'but
sunny-haired Herminia seems to thrive on her grief; but you know she
is ever all dimples--dimples on her white elbows and chin, cheeks,
and hands--soft jolly dimples.”Œ¢'I have been longing to go to a wedding, and yours more than all,
dear Herminia; for being aware of your betrothal, it was one to which
I always looked forward.”Œ£'I have never said so,' replied Herminia, with a perceptible tremor
in her sweet voice; 'but no doubt it is this fortune of which you
speak that Heinrich wants.'”Œˆ'I have seen Frankenburg, and know that he has the reputation of
being dangerously handsome; but I thought he was on leave of absence?'”Œ¬'I mean this,' said the Countess, with grim asperity, hiding her
suspicions, if she had any, 'my dear child, the regiment of Heinrich
is under orders for foreign service!”Œ”'I think my brother Heinrich is acting foolishly in bringing the
English friend (of whom he writes so frequently) to Frankenburg,'
said Ernestine.”Œ2'In
Heaven's name, what _do_ you mean, Herminia?'”Œä'In
the battle-field,' thought Charlie, 'I shall cheerfully meet death,
front to front and face to face; but I shall not carry there the mark
of Cain, by perhaps shooting the brother of her I love--my brother in
the spirit.'”XH  'In-deed, sir,' says my father,
and that was all he did say--leastways to the Dean--but he used to
tell me he felt really faint in himself when he looked round our
choir as I can remember it, all comfortable and furnished-like, and
then see this nasty little dry picter, as he called it, drawn out by
some London architect.”Œà'It is incomprehensible your being here,' said the Count, in a still
more broken voice, and few could have seen that old man weeping
unmoved, 'as her last words were, "Meet me at Burtscheid--at
Burtscheid, dearest Carl."'”Œ‡'It is most fortunate,' said Rhineberg, after a little pause, 'that
the young Graf Heinrich is at home during such a terrible crisis.'”Œ¡'It means, my dear child,' said the Countess, laughing heartily at
her niece's perplexity; 'it means that it was all a plot of
Ernestine's and Heinrich's, too.”Œ_'Let him take heed, that, in meeting you, he has not met with his
own,' said Herminia merrily.”Œ’'My dear, I am sorry to spoil your pleasure here; but to-morrow
morning _we go_,' said the Countess, rising haughtily; 'come with me,
Ernestine.”Œ*'My sufferings are indeed great, Herminia.”Œ’'Nay, nay, his visit is to last some time; and time will prove that I
am right,' persisted Herminia, twisting up her coils of golden brown
hair.”ŒŠ'Next week will see us on the march for France,' said he, 'and I may
cross the purposes of your family and the path of Ernestine no more!”Œw'No Ludwig at all,' he replied, laughing, and embracing her; 'but
your own cousin, my belle--Heinrich of Frankenburg.'”Œw'Not to call people, Doctor, dear no,'
was the answer; 'more what he brought with him from Ireland, I believe
it was.”Œ'Oh, Herminia!'”Œ'Oh, Herminia, darling!'”Œ¡'Penniless girls are often married for their beauty,' said young
Frankenburg, laughing; 'why should not a penniless man be married for
his talents or bravery?'”Œm'Read--read--it is the name of my son--my Heinrich, that you see,'
said the Countess, in a breathless voice.”ŒÝ'She died talking of you--not raving--the poor angel,' said the old
Count, as he bent fondly over the coffined girl, 'but smiling
sweetly, and saying earnestly, again and, again, that she would meet
you at Burtscheid.'”Œ)'She was educated in England, I believe?'”ŒÎ'So, as we have nothing better than Geneva and beer,' said the
Captain, 'it will be useless to discuss the question as to the aroma
of Veuve Clicquot, as compared with that of sparkling hock or
Sillery.'”Œb'Thanks, Carl, but I would rather fire at my own figure in a mirror,'
said Frankenburg, laughing.”Xc  'That I wish you every joy; but I must own, that when proposing to
"have out" this Herr Mansfeld, your reply about shooting at
_yourself_ in a mirror puzzled me,' said Pierrepont, laughing
heartily at the whole situation, and enchanted with the happy scene
amid which he was introduced to two such beautiful girls as the
famous Belles of Frankenburg.”Œ'That has been a misfortune caused by your being educated in England,
while he was at the university, and then with the army.'”Œ'That he has got extended leave of absence from Potsdam, and next
week will arrive at Frankenburg, to spend some time with us.”ŒP'The Baron GrÃ¼nthal, Oberdirector of the Consistory Court in
Aix-la-Chapelle.'”Œi'They hanged my brother at Borny,' said another;' so, by Baalzebub,
let us hang him--hang him, Etienne!'”Œ€'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
    So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
    There is some space.”Œ'To Berlin!'”Œ
'To Paris!”ŒÚ'To your room, Grafine,' said the Countess with hauteur; so her
daughter gladly withdrew, leaving her to make excuses for her absence
as she pleased, so the usual female ailment of a headache came at
once into play.”Œu'We don't attend to either much in the 95th,' was Charlie's evasive
reply; 'besides, our Herr Pastor is a Lutheran.'”Œ'We leave Cologne to-morrow.'”Œ'Welcome to Cologne, Carl!'”Œª'Well, well,' thought he, with something of grim joy, 'the war is
before me, and who can foresee what honours I may win in defending
Germany, or on the soil of France!'”ŒŸ'Were my cousin the Archduke himself,' said Herminia, wearily, for
she was pretty well used to hear these encomiums, 'he would be
totally indifferent to me.'”ŒB'What certainty is there that Here Pierrepont was wounded at all?'”Œy'What was it,'
she cried as she drew near, 'what was it as I said, before ever I come
out of Dorsetshire to this place?”ŒX'With Herminia at the west end of London; so you and she will get on
famously together.”Œg'Would to Heaven that I had never known him--that we had never, never
come to Cologne,' she exclaimed.”Œ='Yes, at Frankenburg; they are familiar with your name there.”ŒF'You are too beautiful not to be quite aware of it,' replied Herminia.”Œ¹'You know, mamma,' said she, in a tone of explanation, though none
was required, 'we drove into town, Herr Pierrepont and I, that I
might show him the tomb and throne of Charlemagne.'”X  'Your tears, my own darling,' said he, 'are a rebuke, and more than a
sufficient rebuke, for my suspicion; and bitter, indeed, would this
parting-time have been to me, but for the knowledge--the sure
conviction--that, even if a thousand cousins came, still we shall
meet at Aix.'”Œ©18.--For some time past rumors have been circulated
in Hardin to the effect that Diamond Island, in the river about two
miles from this place, was the home of a ghost.”ŒA

five ghosts and an airy 'rickshaw by going to England!”X  A French five-franc piece of the second

separated the past from the present; still more did it seem to yawn
between the present and the future; so Charlie could but wring his
hands, and wish, at times, that Heinrich had never brought him to
Frankenburg.”Œ@A couple of hours later there came a telegram from Davos for me.”ŒvA dealer in the North of London
suffered heavy penalties as a receiver of stolen goods in connexion
with the affair.”ŒœA few days after the Thuringians and others advanced from the
Moselle, the quiet family in the old Schloss of Frankenburg assembled
as usual at breakfast.”ŒTA few days later news
reached them that Mr. Ross-Lewin had died suddenly in Dublin.”Œ‚A few years ago (_i.e._ before 1894) a curious incident occurred in a
public school in connection with the belief in the Banshee.”ŒA great part of this notable novel takes
place in the less known parts of the Soudan, where the main actors in
the drama meet and work out their destinies.”Œ©A lady who is a relation of one of the compilers, and a member of a Co.

Banshee in her family.”ŒqA letter from Miss Oldys to a friend in Lichfield, begun a day or two

a perfect substitute.”X  A little time more, and she was confined to her bed, where she lay
for hours with her hot hand clasped in that of Herminia's, who bathed
her temples with Rimmel and eau de Cologne, and fanned and petted
her, while she tossed on her pillow, and muttered 'Carl!”ŒöA portrait like this would set you far above
all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if
old men are ever capable of any emotion.â€

â€œI know you will laugh at me,â€ he replied, â€œbut I really canâ€™t exhibit
it.”X  A short billiard tournament had
filled up the time between breakfast and lunch, with Badminton and the
morning papers for those who were temporarily not engaged, while
afterwards, the interval till teatime had been occupied by the majority
of the party in a huge game of hide-and-seek all over the house, barring
the billiard-room, which was sanctuary for any who desired peace.”Xµ  A shriek escaped the startled girl, and she rushed indoors for her
father, her _bonne_, and everybody else; assistance was soon
procured, the sufferer carried indoors, placed in bed, his uniform
hidden, for the Francs-Tireurs were hovering about, and medical aid
was procured from the nearest village, in the person of a young
doctor, Adolphe Guerrand, on whom, as an admirer of CÃ©landine, they
could rely for silence and secrecy.”ŒÉA single glance showed
Pierrepont where his comrade sat--a smart and handsome young officer
in undress uniform, who was caressing a dark moustache, and making
himself agreeable to a lady beside him.”ŒLA single thing, as I am now, that wonders
    To hear thee speak of Naples.”ŒÔA straight switchback
road lay in front of us, and the monster plunged silently down hill, and
said below his breath, â€œHa-ha--ha-ha--ha-ha,â€ as, without diminution of
speed, he breasted the opposing slope.”X£  A summons from Prince Bismarck, for the Baron GrÃ¼nthal to attend at
Berlin, in consequence of some affairs connected with the
Oberconsistory Court at Aix, gave poor Ernestine a temporary respite
from the annoyance of his presence and clumsy attentions; and as she
was at times easier in mind, and more content to wait the issue of
events, after that remarkable and somewhat solemn interchange of
promises at Burtscheid Church, her parents began to hope that all was
at an end between her and the Herr Lieutenant of Infantry, and that
she would be content to receive the Baron as her husband in time,
perhaps when Heinrich returned, if God spared him ever to return.”Œ±A wealthy and great man--an intimate friend of the house of
Frankenburg, who, though not noble, was nevertheless Hochwohlgeboren,
had made proposals for the hand of Ernestine.”Xv  A week after this, a drochski deposited a smart-looking young
officer, in the uniform of the 95th Thuringian regiment--blue with
red facings and silver epaulettes, spike-helmet and black belt--at
the entrance of the Pariser Hof of Cologne, a comfortable and
moderate hotel, suitable to that style of economy continental
military men are usually constrained to practise.”X  A week had passed away at Frankenburg, and the subject of the young
Count's return--that event so dreaded by poor Herminia, from motives
of delicacy, perhaps--had not been resumed, till the evening which
saw him and his comrade driving through the beautiful scenery just
referred to.”X‘  A. R. WYLIE

Author of â€œThe Rajahâ€™s Peopleâ€ and â€œDividing Watersâ€

_Crown 8vo_, =6s.=


In THE DAUGHTER OF BRAHMA we are transported back to the mysterious
atmosphere and brilliant Oriental colourings which marked the authorâ€™s
first novel, â€œThe Rajahâ€™s People.â€ But here the complications of race
and religion in India are faced from another standpoint--that of the
woman.”ŒTAbove all, I remembered from
Cambridge days, what Louisâ€™ â€˜dropping inâ€™ meant.”ŒÔAbove this fireplace
there hangs with grim significance a portrait of handsome Dick, in the
insolent beauty of early manhood, attributed to Holbein, and a dozen
other portraits of great merit face the windows.”X›  Accept, again, as truthful, the tales of spirit Manifestation in
America--musical or other sounds--writings on paper, produced by no
discernible hand--articles of furniture moved without apparent human
agency--or the actual sight and touch of hands, to which no bodies seem
to belong--still there must be found the MEDIUM or living being, with
constitutional peculiarities capable of obtaining these signs.”Œ‡According to the great alchemist, Pierre de
Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India
made him eloquent.”ŒñAfter a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and
gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as
well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more
than once spent the winter.”ŒûAfter five years' service a man is directly or indirectly
acquainted with the two or three hundred Civilians in his Province, all
the Messes of ten or twelve Regiments and Batteries, and some fifteen
hundred other people of the non-official castes.”Œ&Again the voice of Heinrich was heard.”Xb  Alike in fiction and
in more serious works, they introduce us to writers of exceptional
ability, and to subjects of uncommon interest.â€ THE NEW YORK HERALD
says: â€œThey have long ago acquired the reputation for the production of
original books.â€


                       Mills & Boonâ€™s New Novels

                         _Crown 8vo, 6s.”Œ,All Germany onward, and march into France!"'”Œ~All I have with
me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.â€

Dorian looked at him and smiled.”ŒAll I say is, watch over Sibyl.”X  All but mariners
    Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
    Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
    With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
    Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty,
    And all the devils are here.'”Œ~All is unchanged since you left Frankenburg, from whence
my heart goes with this to you, my dearest Betrothed of Burtscheid.'”ŒÑAll might have believed him to
be dead, and she, perhaps yielding to the influences around her; but
no, no--he thrust that thought aside, and recalled the solemnity of
their vows interchanged at Burtscheid.”Œ5All that matters, Davos, is going as well as it
can.”Xõ  All the members of our party, however, were known to
him more or less well, and on this third day as we sailed through the
narrow opening into the lagoon and saw the circular ridge of trees in a
gold and crimson sunset before us, his last words to me when we parted
in London for some unaccountable reason came back very sharply to my
memory, and recalled the curious impression of prophecy with which I
had first heard them:

â€œEnjoy your holiday and store up all the force you can,â€ he had said as
the train slipped out of Victoria; â€œand we will meet in Berlin on the
15th--unless you should send for me sooner.â€

And now suddenly the words returned to me so clearly that it seemed
I almost heard his voice in my ear: â€œUnless you should send for me
sooner;â€ and returned, moreover, with a significance I was wholly at a
loss to understand that touched somewhere in the depths of my mind a
vague sense of apprehension that they had all along been intended in
the nature of a prophecy.”X=  Already Grunthal, Rheinburg, and sundry other
Grafs had called in their ramshackle old-fashioned coaches and
droschkies, covered with coats-of-arms exhibiting the usual German
infinity of quarterings; and certain officials of Aix-la-Chapelle,
with their wives, who, like other wives all over Germany, insisted
upon taking the titles of their husbands' occupation, had been day
after day leaving their cards, having heard that 'the Belles of
Frankenburg had returned;' but now all were to be denied, and this
afternoon was to be devoted to the only son of the house.”X‰  Amid the pure satisfaction arising from the knowledge that Ernestine
loved him, and the natural anxiety to discover how she was ever to be
his wife, there was fated to come to Charlie Pierrepont the fear of
greater opposition to his--as yet--secret hopes and wishes, in the
person of a formidable rival, who, in a few weeks after the visit to
the Dom Kirche, came suddenly into the field.”XÁ  Among the visitors was Baron GrÃ¼nthal, the Oberdirector of the
Consistory Court at Aix, a stout and florid, but rather handsome man,
in the prime of life, with an ill-trimmed moustache hiding his whole
mouth, and the inevitable red ribbon at his button-hole, who
mentioned incidentally that he had seen the Grafine and Herr
Pierrepont leaving the Dom Kirche by the great door, on either side
of which are a she-wolf and a fir apple in bronze.”Œ¬An American lady present suggested that the description tallied with
that of the Banshee, upon which the Count said:

"I am an O'Neill--at least I am descended from one.”Œ¶An element that was mysterious, and in a sense
disheartening, crept unbidden into the severity of grey rock and dark
pine forest and took the sparkle from the sunshine and the sea.”X*  An enormous amount of beer was consumed on the occasion, and in 'the
study,' the Count and Baron GrÃ¼nthal over their pipes, and certainly
more than one bottle of Rhenish wine, grasped each other's hands ever
and anon, and shouted, in the melodious language of the Vaterland,

'Hoch, Heinrich!”Œ+An' de owl mourn' out, "Whut-_whoo_-o-o-o!"”ŒÔAn' he gwine along jes as fast as he kin' whin he come' to de aidge ob
de buryin'-ground whut on de hill, an' right dar he bound to stop,
'ca'se de kentry round about am so populate' he ain't able to go frough.”ŒDAnd Charlie, as he thought, turned his back on Frankenburg for ever.”Œ¸And Eliphalet, he decided
that he would rather be a well-fed lawyer in New York, living
comfortably on his practice, than a starving lord in Scotland, living
scantily on his title."”Œ©And Heinrich ordered his horse and departed, leaving Charlie
Pierrepont in a more contented mood of mind than he had been in since
he left the boudoir of the Countess.”ŒAnd I turned
my sight from the Shadow--above all, from those strange serpent
eyes--eyes that had now become distinctly visible.”ŒaAnd Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
    Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?”Œ¨And Uncle Larry proceeded:

"Eliphalet went down to the little old house at Salem, and as soon as
the clock struck twelve the rival ghosts began wrangling as before.”ŒÑAnd as the slow hours of the night stole on, he thought of the
ghastly face of the French captain who killed the young ensign
Donnersberg, and the peculiar hatred and inhumanity expressed by his
dying wish.”Xë  And he turned over the blotted pages and found there, the last entry,
in a very delicate and individual handwriting--

â€œ_John Silence_, London.â€




CASE V

THE CAMP OF THE DOG


I

Islands of all shapes and sizes troop northward from Stockholm by the
hundred, and the little steamer that threads their intricate mazes in
summer leaves the traveller in a somewhat bewildered state as regards
the points of the compass when it reaches the end of its journey at
Waxholm.”ŒnAnd her brother and sister did come to see her,
and entered the town of Dover just as Mrs. Veal was expiring.”X{  And ifâ€--he lowered his voice and turned for
a moment towards the bows, and then continued in his most weighty
manner--â€œowing to delicate health or other predisposing causes, his
Double--you know what I mean, of course--his etheric Body of Desire, or
astral body, as some term it--that part in which the emotions, passions
and desires reside--if this, I say, were for some constitutional reason
loosely joined to his physical organism, there might well take place an
occasional projection----â€

Sangree came aft with a sudden rush, his face aflame, but whether with
wind or sun, or with what he had heard, I cannot say.”ŒÿAnd now to account for the mysterious disappearance of Charlie
Pierrepont, which the Herr Doctor could only account for by supposing
that in the restlessness of his agony, or desire to procure water, he
had crawled away into some obscure corner to die.”Xb  And on most evenings I shall have so much
to tell you; I canâ€™t â€œdrop inâ€ across half London.â€™

Now if you have been abroad for five years, it is a great deal to know
that you have any intimate friend at all still left in the metropolis,
and, as Louis said, to have that intimate friend next door, is an
excellent reason for going next door.”X=  And one evening toward the end of the
summer, the wedding-day having been appointed for early in September,
she told him that she didn't want to bridal tour at all; she just wanted
to go down to the little old house at Salem to spend her honeymoon in
peace and quiet, with nothing to do and nobody to bother them.”Xn  And so when Charlie Pierrepont left his kind friends and that
charming part of Lorraine, he little knew that he left behind a warm
girlish heart that yearned for him, and him only, and thought nothing
of Monsieur Adolphe, with all his thousands of francs, her father's
choice; and keenly she envied her--the unknown lady--whose miniature
was in Charlie's heart.”ŒrAnd so when I got this offer from Paris, I
determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.”X  And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite
specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting
the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and
stitched over with iridescent beetlesâ€™ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that
from their transparency are known in the East as â€œwoven air,â€ and
â€œrunning water,â€ and â€œevening dewâ€; strange figured cloths from Java;
elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair
blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of
_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish
velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,
with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.”X1  And splendid was the aspect of the strong brigade, with the King's
Grenadiers in front, the Westphalians in the centre, and the 95th
Thuringians in the rear, as it defiled across the bridge that led to
the suburb of St. Johann, each battalion with its carts of reserve
ammunition, drawn by six horses.”X  And still further to achieve the laudable end of subduing him, she
was now at her piano, practising sundry vapid fashionable songs which
she had learned in England, just as our English girls strum German
and Italian, learned, perhaps, at second hand from some poor needy
governess.”Œ¼And then he thought of his three sisters at home, and what his
emotions would be if such a scene, as he had just interrupted, had
taken place in his father's quiet house in Warwickshire.”X÷  And there, at Christmas time, a tall fir-tree from the Reichswald;
covered with toys and cakes, grotesque masks, _papier-machÃ©_ dolls,
candles and shining lights, gladdened the hearts of the little
tenantry, who were cuddled and kissed up and down by the hearty old
Baron acting Father Christmas, with a mighty white beard, a cowl, and
long wand; while Ernestine and Herminia glided about like good
fairies, dispensing viands and wine to the sturdy Teutons and their
blooming fraus, when the trees of the Reichswald were leafless and
bare, and the branches glittered like silver and crystal in the
frostwork, and the first snowdrops of the season were peeping up in
sheltered spots, and the brown stacks of the last harvest were
mantled with snow.”X	  And this brave-hearted and handsome young Englishman--Carl, her own
Carl--he was risking wounds and death, enduring toil and suffering
for the Kaiser, for Germany, and for _her_; for well she knew that
Charlie Pierrepont identified her image with the Fatherland.”Œ"And to London
succeeded Scotland.”Œ¾And when I left London, abandoned
my career, such as it was, I did so because I intended to devote my life
to the cultivation of joy, and, by continuous and unsparing effort, to
be happy.”ŒeAnd when I left home to soldier in
Prussia, my sisters were mere children; but dear she is, indeed.'”X,  And when the train stopped for ten panting minutes at the little
station in northern France, and he got out to stretch his legs on the
platform, and saw to his dismay a further batch of the British Isles
debouching from another train, it suddenly seemed impossible to him to
continue the journey.”X  And, after all, you said something to me the day
before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful,
but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to
everything.â€

â€œWhat was that, Harry?â€

â€œYou said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of
romanceâ€”that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that
if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.â€

â€œShe will never come to life again now,â€ muttered the lad, burying his
face in his hands.”X?  And, as I watched, it was almost necessary to persuade myself forcibly
that I was only standing upright with difficulty in this little
sand-hole of a modern garden in the south of England, for it seemed to
me that I stood, as in vision, at the entrance of some vast rock-hewn
Temple far, far down the river of Time.”Œ¡And, moreover, "the
discourse is attested by a very sober gentlewoman, who lives in
Canterbury, within a few doors of the house in which Mrs. Bargrave
lives."”ŒYAnd, then, you are a soldier,
Carl--and to be a soldier is always a trump card with him.”ŒÈAnd, through the smoke, peering at him from the corners
of the room, he saw that all the Brothers about him had the faces he
had known and lived with long ago--RÃ¶st, Fluheim, Meinert, Rigel, Gysin.”Xô  Anon the brass bands struck up between the echoing streets of
SaarbrÃ¼ck; but amid all the enthusiasm of the time, the crash of the
martial music, the measured tramping of thousands of marching feet,
Charlie's mind could not help reverting to those happy moments in the
stair of the Hoch Munster, and the sadder ones in the quiet little
church of Burtscheid, and, in memory, he still saw the rosy,
trembling lips of the girl he loved, and the full bosom that rose and
fell with sobs and sighs.”Œ½Another army defended the north,
under Von Falkenstein; so taken altogether, including the Landwehr,
Prussia, with her million and a quarter of well-drilled soldiery,
seemed impregnable.”XÚ  Around Ars and Grigy, Borny and Colombey, and many other hamlets and
picturesque chateaux, the cattle, rich in colour and sleek in hide,
were chewing the cud among the knee-deep pastures; the fresh blue
streams ran on their course as if rejoicing to escape the scenes of
blood that were about to ensue; the blue kingfishers flitted about,
and the sparrows twittered in the green hedge-rows, the branches of
which were matted and intertwined with gorgeous wild flowers.”Œ°Arrived at Bombay in the spring of the year, we went our respective
ways, to meet no more for the next three or four months, when my leave
and her love took us both to Simla.”Œ©As a matter of fact, Dreyfus
does not occupy a cage at all; the notion that he does so arises from a
misunderstanding of the French word "case," which signifies a hut.”Œ†As for
conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and
two of these canâ€™t be admitted into decent society.”ŒQAs for Sibyl, I do not know at
present whether her attachment is serious or not.”Œ£As for the lives of oneâ€™s neighbours,
if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt oneâ€™s moral
views about them, but they are not oneâ€™s concern.”Xî  As he
turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of
Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand â€œ_du supplice encore mal lavÃ©e_,â€ with
its downy red hairs and its â€œ_doigts de faune_.â€ He glanced at his own
white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and
passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:

Sur une gamme chromatique,
    Le sein de perles ruisselant,
La VÃ©nus de lâ€™Adriatique
    Sort de lâ€™eau son corps rose et blanc.”Xm  As he bade them adieu and left them, the French girl, with a quick
pretty action, flicked some holy water in his face from a Dresden
china font that hung inside the door of the dining-room, and the
glittering drops fell on his moustache and silver gorget, which the
Prussians still wear, or at least wore then; and father and daughter
stood sadly in the porch, looking after their protector as he marched
off at the head of his men, for Charlie, though a thorough English
gentleman, was, as some say, 'the soldier all over, but the soldier
adventurer--the soldier of fortune, rather than the soldier of
routine.'”X  As is the case with Hearne's own collections, the
diary of Poynter contained a good many notes from printed books,
descriptions of coins and other antiquities that had been brought to
his notice, and drafts of letters on these subjects, besides the
chronicle of everyday events.”Xæ  As she was in her mere girlhood, it appeared that she was too young
to marry, nor had ever thought of it; and more than all, as Adolphe
was poor, having only his practice as a hard-working village
practitioner, Monsieur de CaillÃ© was by no means disposed to look
upon him, even in the future, as an eligible suitor for his daughter,
till a letter reached young Guerrand from Paris by which one morning
he found himself rich by one of the most extraordinary chances in the
world.”ŒóAs southerns, the family of Frankenburg were more gay and lively in
manner than Germans usually are, for being nearer the Rhine they had
been for generations insensibly under French influences; yet they
were all German, to the heart's core.”X  As the troops were to halt on the field pending those operations
which led to the battle of Gravelotte, a chain of out-pickets was
detailed for the night, and Charlie Pierrepont, as many of his
seniors had been killed off or wounded in that day's strife, had
command of one of these, consisting of two non-commissioned officers
and thirty men, with whom he was ordered to take possession of a
little chateau nearer Metz than Bellecroix, to use it as his
picket-house, and post his sentinels as to him seemed best.”ŒzAs you walk along a series of beautifully shaded reservoirs you see
the romantic ruins of the old castle of Frankenburg.'”Œ•At Cambridge he had
spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken
a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.”ŒtAt a place on the Turnpike road, between Cape
Girardeau and Jackson, is what is familiarly known as Spooks' Hollow.”ŒAt all Booksellers.”ŒrAt all events, they had them there in the little old
house at Salem the night Eliphalet and his friend came down.”X_  At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon
Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial
if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called
selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was
considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him.”Œ¿At its base he dismounted, and slaying his horse, as Roland
did at the battle of Roncesvalles (but with a pistol), he drew his
sword, and began to ascend the opposite slope of the Geisberg.”Œ—At last the meal passed over--and it proved the last that Charlie
Pierrepont was to consume in Frankenburg; the ladies rose from the
table to retire.”Œ;At last the old church of Burtscheid rose before him again.”ŒšAt once all Dennistoun's cherished dreams of finding priceless
manuscripts in untrodden corners of France flashed up, to die down again
the next moment.”X?  At such a crisis, Adolphe Guerrand had vague ideas--from what he had
read in novels and seen at the theatre of the Porte St. Martin, when
he was a student in Paris, at the Ecole de Medicin--that he should
drop on his knees, or at least on one knee; but the floor was very
slippery, and CÃ©landine not being much in love with him, and very
much inclined to laugh, he didn't attempt a melodramatic posÃ© at this
betrothal, which Charlie saw as in a dream; for his thoughts were at
Burtscheid, and the heart-stirring parting words of Ernestine were
lingering in his ear.”Œ At that moment I turned to Hugh.”X(  At that moment a Uhlan came spurring into camp with letters for the
brigade from the field post; those for the 95th were soon
distributed: there was one for Heinrich from Herminia, with another
for Charlie enclosed, and both became at once deep in their contents
by the last light of the sun.”ŒÌAt the corresponding
time in Egypt Machmout was describing speaking to us of a â€œsittâ€ (lady)
having tea in a room which he described with some minuteness, and I am
waiting anxiously for her letter.”Œ’At the gate stood a handsome britzka, with a pair of horses, the
reins of which were held by Heinrich, who was without groom or other
attendant.”ŒçAt the theater I found them amid the crowd of
yelling _jhampanies_; outside the club veranda, after a long evening of
whist; at the birthday ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and
in broad daylight when I went calling.”X‚  Aware of this, when the Uhlan trumpet sounded, CÃ©landine de CaillÃ©,
like most young girls, a light sleeper, heard it before the war-worn
Charlie, and pale and startled, came forth in the prettiest of
morning robes to bid him farewell, and to stuff his havresack, and
the havresacks of his men (though they were Prussians), with all that
the Bavarians had not consumed last night.”X’  BOSTON

JOHN SILENCE

CASE I

A PSYCHICAL INVASION


â€œAnd what is it makes you think I could be of use in this particular
case?â€ asked Dr. John Silence, looking across somewhat sceptically at
the Swedish lady in the chair facing him.”Xð  Baron Rhineberg, 'a beer-bloated Teuton' of the first class, came
occasionally to talk politics with the Count, over a pipe and flask
of Rhine wine; the two daughters of the Justiz-rath, and a few other
visitors, dropped in, but Ernestine found it weary work to talk
commonplaces with these people, not one of whom had any vital or
particular interest, beyond a national one, in the army now in the
field; and to chat of music and books, of Berlin wools and soup for
the poor, when, perhaps, _at that very moment of time_, the bullets
might be whistling about him she loved; or when he might be stretched
wounded, dying or dead, upon the bloody sod--to talk, we say, of
aught that was frivolous, with such fears in her heart, was
impossible.”ŒBeer, the Bible, and the seven deadly
virtues have made our England what she is.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t like your country, then?â€ she asked.”ŒfBefore the first wedded year was
out the American quitted England abruptly, and never returned to it.”Xk  Being in London, with time on his hands, and not far from the
sale-room at which I have obscurely hinted, Mr. Denton thought that he
would spend an hour there upon the chance of finding, among that
portion of the famous Thomas collection of MSS., which he knew to be
then on view, something bearing upon the history or topography of his
part of Warwickshire.”Œ\Besides, to be at Bircham after
dark means that we shouldnâ€™t get back here till midnight.”ŒÆBircham and its fables had given me a very bad night, and I was
perfectly aware that I did not in the least want to go near it, though
yesterday I had quite truthfully said I should like to do so.”ŒBlake, _S.T.P._, _Decanus_.”ŒwBoth
coins were sent to the government expert in Philadelphia and the lighter
one was declared to be the genuine one.”XC  Both--till the end--were absolutely fearless, and Dr
Assheton would sit by the bedside of the man stricken with bubonic
plague to note the gradual surge of the tide of disease to the reasoning
faculty with the same absorption as Fielder would study X-rays one week,
flying machines the next, and spiritualism the third.”Œ™BrantÃ´me
says she is a spirit that haunts the old castle of Lusignan, where,
by loud shrieks, she announces any disasters that are to befall
France.'”X|  Bullied as a young man into a lucrative family living, he had in turn
bullied his mind into some semblance of orthodox beliefs, doing the
honours of the little country church with an energy that made one think
of a coal-heaver tending china; and it was only in the past few years
that he had resigned the living and taken instead to cramming young men
for their examinations.”Œ~But Herminia made no reply, so the Countess repeated what she had
said, and fixed her eyes steadily and inquiringly upon her.”X  But Herminia surveyed them all as one who was in a dream, and kept
repeating to herself, as she drew the rose from her breast and
pressed it to her trembling lips with all a young girl's fervour:

'Yes--yes--I must see him once again, and then all will be over--over
for ever!'”X   But I
remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _dÃ©colletÃ©e_
she was then.â€

â€œShe is still _dÃ©colletÃ©e_,â€ he answered, taking an olive in his long
fingers; â€œand when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an
_Ã©dition de luxe_ of a bad French novel.”ŒBut I
wasnâ€™t.”ŒaBut I suppose you will be back soon?â€

â€œNo: I am going to be out of England for six months.”X  But I, when
I reach my prime--I am nearing it--ah, you shall see.â€

The stars had begun to appear in the blue velvet of the sky, and to the
east the horizon seen above the black silhouette of the village was
growing dove-coloured with the approach of moon-rise.”ŒBBut I, when I reach my prime--I am nearing it--ah, you shall see."”Œ
But Sibyl!”Œ‹But Venice,
like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true
romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.”Œ-But donâ€™t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane.”ŒÔBut eventually the
work was done, and the house (which, though untenanted, had always
been kept sound and weather-tight) woke up, and like Monte Cristo's
mansion at Auteuil, lived, sang, and bloomed once more.”XŒ  But for the soft and gentle influences under which Charlie and his
friend were at Frankenburg, they would certainly, like Prussian
officers in general (though gaming is strictly forbidden in the
army), have spent many an hour at the New Redoute, or Gaming House,
in the Comphausbad-Strasse, where games of hazard, rouge-et-noir,
roulette, and so forth, are played from morning till midnight.”X˜  But he changed his mind, and carefully placed it in his
breast-pocket as a _souvenir_ for Ernestine of the battles before
Metz, and hurried to join the shattered remnant of his regiment, now
hurrying with others, double-quick, to take part in the attack of the
orchards of the farm of Bellecroix, where two batteries of
mitrailleuses made dreadful havoc among the assailants, sweeping
whole ranks away.”Œ7But he described to her
the little old house at Salem.”Œ\But he had never said anything about the ghost which haunted
the little old house at Salem.”Xa  But he had not
presented himself; nor did I hear more of him for three days, when I
received a letter from him, dated from Liverpool to this effect:--

          "HONORED SIR,--I humbly entreat your pardon,
          though I can scarcely hope that you will think I
          deserve it, unless--which Heaven forbid--you saw
          what I did.”ŒBut he never got any proof of its
presence until he went down to the little old house of Salem, just
before the Fourth of July.”Œ²But he never saw the mother, who was
in 'Frisco, or Los Angeles, or Santa Fe, or somewhere out West, and he
saw a great deal of the daughter, who was up in the White Mountains.”Œ'But in London people are so prejudiced.”ŒÅBut it did: and it knocked me out of time.â€

I had heard some such theory before, and though Hugh put it rather
picturesquely, there was nothing in the least convincing or practical
about it.”Œ…But now, Herminia,
will you brave the prospect of poverty--a life of utter
dependence--go back to England as a governess, perhaps?'”XI  But out of those things
spring very bad ones, useless renunciations, asceticism for its own
sake, mortification of the flesh with nothing to follow, no
corresponding gain that is, and that awful and terrible disease which
devastated England some centuries ago, and from which by heredity of
spirit we suffer now, Puritanism.”ŒEBut rank was the _joss_, the idol that was worshipped in Frankenburg.”XW  But remember--
    For that's my business to you--that you three
    From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
    Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
    Him and his innocent child; for which foul deed
    The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
    Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
    Against your peace.”ŒBut she did not come to herself, she had no precise recollection
of anything, till she found herself entering a church near Portland
Place.”Œ‡But the Prussians made a desert of
France, burned villages and small towns, and treated old people and
women with horrible barbarity.”ŒBut the Scotch ghost was not unpleasant, like the Salem ghost,
although it had one peculiarity in common with its trans-Atlantic
fellow-spook.”X4  But the impression was momentary, for that first breakfast in Camp
permitted no divided attentions, and I dare swear that the porridge,
the tea, the Swedish â€œflatbread,â€ and the fried fish flavoured with
points of frizzled bacon, were better than any meal eaten elsewhere
that day in the whole world.”ŒhBut there is no literary public in
England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias.”Xw  But there was something in the
sight of that grey and silent figure, lying in its modern box of lead
and wood at the bottom of this sandy grave, swathed in the bandages of
centuries and wrapped in the perfumed linen that the priests of Egypt
had prayed over with their mighty enchantments thousands of years
before--something in the sight of it lying there and breathing its own
spice-laden atmosphere even in the darkness of its exile in this remote
land, something that pierced to the very core of my being and touched
that root of awe which slumbers in every man near the birth of tears
and the passion of true worship.”XX  But to certain others, few
indeed in number, but almost fanatically convinced of their own
orthodoxy, the charm of Luxor, like some sleeping beauty, only wakes
when these things cease, when the hotel has grown empty and the
billiard-marker â€œhas gone for a long restâ€ to Cairo, when the decimated
quail and the decimating tourist have fled northwards, and the Theban
plain, DanÃ¦ to a tropical sun, is a gridiron across which no man would
willingly make a journey by day, not even if Queen Hatasoo herself
should signify that she would give him audience on the terraces of
Deir-el-Bahari.”Œ¥But with all this, it should be borne in mind, from past experience
of French invading armies, how would those of the Emperor have
behaved had they reached Berlin?”XÙ  But with regard to his relations, that
which turned their bereavement, which must soon have occurred, into a
source of blank dismay instead of pious resignation, was that not one of
these English pounds, not even their less satisfactory equivalent in
notes, which, out of the tourist season, are looked upon at Luxor as a
not very dependable variety of Philosopherâ€™s stone, though certainly
capable of producing gold under favourable circumstances, could be
found.”ŒˆBut you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent
face, and your marvellous untroubled youthâ€”I canâ€™t believe anything
against you.”Œ¯But, more than that, it was the cry I had so often heard in the
Western States of America where the Indians still fight and hunt and
struggle--it was the cry of the Redskin!”ŒÚBy the
way, it does not seem to be true that the Banshee exclusively follows
families of Irish descent, for the last incident had reference to the
death of a member of a Co. Galway family English by name and origin.”Œ™By this time we were deep in the shadow of the Blessington lower road
and the 'rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pine-clad, overhanging
shale cliff.”Œ®By this time, a considerable portion of the German army had
penetrated so far to the west and north-west of Metz, as to be almost
already between Marshal Bazaine and Paris!”ŒÌCANON ALBERIC'S SCRAP-BOOK

SECRET WORSHIP


Harris, the silk merchant, was in South Germany on his way home from
a business trip when the idea came to him suddenly that he would take
the mountain railway from Strassbourg and run down to revisit his old
school after an interval of something more than thirty years.”ŒCaliban
    Thou earth, thou!”Œ%Came to Madrid once when I was there.”ŒpCan it be a porcupine?â€ exclaimed the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate with
distress, forgetting that Sweden was not Canada.”X  Carl--or Charlie, as he was known
when he was wont to hold his wicket in the playing-grounds of Rugby
against the best bowler in the three hundred, and to con his studies
in the white brick Tudor school-house, or in the long avenue called
Addison's Walk--was a great favourite with all his regiment, and
already had the honour of being specially noticed on parade by our
Princess Royal when her husband was reviewing the Prussian troops,
and of receiving from his hand the much-coveted Iron Cross when
almost in his boyhood.”X‡  Certain it is that for many weeks after the event Charlie seemed to
hover between life and death, sanity and insanity, at the Grand
Monarque; and when he rejoined the Thuringianas before the walls of
Paris, he had become so haggard, grey-haired, and old-looking, that
his former comrades scarcely recognised him, so much had he undergone
by a fever of the mind, rather than of the body.”Œ Charles
Linkworth, who now lay under capital sentence, was the keeper of a small
stationery store in Sheffield, and there lived with him his wife and
mother.”ŒwCharlie Pierrepont's regiment was formed in brigade with the 7th, or
King's Grenadiers, and the 37th, or Westphalians.”ŒqCharlie Pierrepont's work was over
for the day, and like his friend Heinrich, he still found himself
untouched.”X¿  Charlie and Ernestine betook themselves to the piano, where eye could
look into eye, and finger touch finger occasionally in the duet, or
soft whispers be exchanged amid a sonata of Beethoven; the Countess
retired to doze in the boudoir, with her Spitz pug on her knee; while
Herminia and her betrothed found sufficient attraction in each other;
so the evening of this eventful day passed off peacefully and
happily, as many others had done.”X  Charlie could not help laughing at the girl's _naÃ¯ve_ manner, and
thought that the old Warwickshire squire, who was fond of deducing
his descent from Robert, who received the manor of Hurstpierpoint, in
Sussex, from the Conqueror, would have found nothing 'droll' in it.”X}  Charlie forgot that in the Heilinghaist-feld at Altona he had fought
a duel for that brother, and winged an officer of the King's
Grenadiers; and he was just remembering that if hostilities were
contemplated, a messenger would have been sent by Heinrich, when the
latter entered the room, and coming quickly forward to Charlie,
grasped both his hands with his usual frankness.”ŒDCharlie had Ernestine's photo, done and coloured at Aix-la-Chapelle.”X×  Charlie had barely rejoined his regiment, and exchanged a few words
with Heinrich, SchÃ¶nforst, and other friends, when the order came for
the line to advance, as the French were in position at Vionville,
covering the whole southern road to Verdun, with a front extending to
the village of Gorz, eight miles south-west of Metz; and in their
martial ardour to meet the enemy, many of the Thuringians, as the
march forward began, struck up the fine war-song of Arndt.”Œ±Charlie hastened into the edifice, for the Herr Pastor of which, in
happier times, Ernestine and Herminia had worked many altar-cloths,
pen-wipers, slippers, and smoking-caps.”ŒŸCharlie looked puzzled; but ere long, in the case of CÃ©landine
herself, he was to see how matrimonial matters are arranged in the
land of the silver lilies.”X¹  Charlie thought of this as, from the hotel windows, he gazed moodily
into the snow-covered street, with all its bustle and lamps, and
shrank from the passing fear that his aspirations after Ernestine
might only be an impossible and unrealizable longing; but see her
again he must, even if he went to the Schloss--but no, that would
never do after the treatment he had experienced there, and the
epithets applied to him by the Countess.”ŒzCharlie's regiment, with the 40th, 67th, and 69th, was ordered to
surround and storm a cottage mid-way on the Gorze road.”ŒvClose to the
Band-stand the black and white liveries joined me; and I heard Mrs.
Wessington's old appeal at my side.”Œ!Come home, Pansay, and thank God.”ŒCome, Madge, letâ€™s go out.”X  Containing the Revised Rules of Golf, a Chapter on

(New York _Herald_, April 4, 1903)

While he will not admit that he is a believer in spiritualism, the Rev.”X&  Daily, Ernestine, while scanning the papers with keen and
haggard eyes for intelligence of the lost one, heard the marriage
arrangement schemed out; the projected breakfast; the cake which was
to come from the most celebrated confectioner in Aix; the
_trousseau_, which was to come from the most fashionable Putzmacherin
(or _modiste_) in Berlin; the feast in the hall, and who were to be
invited; whether the honeymoon was to be spent at Wiesbaden, at
Carlsbad, or Bruckenau, and the girl listened to them as if she had
been turned to stone.”ŒžDid he leave any message?â€

â€œNo, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not
find you at the club.â€

â€œThat will do, Francis.”Œ|Do you remember,' she
asked, with a sad smile, 'all you endured at Cologne, when you only
knew Heinrich as Herr Mansfeld?'”ŒùDorian is far too sensible.â€

â€œDorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear
Basil.â€

â€œMarriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.â€

â€œExcept in America,â€ rejoined Lord Henry languidly.”ŒQDorian smiled and shook his head: â€œI am afraid I donâ€™t think so, Lady
Henry.”ŒvDr Teesdale had a dinner engagement that night, which he broke, and was
sitting alone in his study by half past nine.”Œ;Dr Teesdale instantly got up, put the receiver to his ears.”Œ!Dr Teesdale looked away from him.”Œ\Dr Teesdale remembered his own moment of terror this morning, but he
spoke quite sincerely.”Œ~Dr Teesdale waited a little, but there was no further sound of any kind,
except the chuckling and croaking of the instrument.”ŒáDr Teesdale was a bachelor and a man of independent means, and lived in
a tall-windowed and commodious house in Bedford Square, where a plain
cook of surpassing excellence looked after his food, and her husband his
person.”ŒrDr Teesdale was a man of good nerve, and he recovered himself almost
immediately, ashamed of his temporary panic.”Œ.Dr Teesdale went to the window and
closed it.”Xà  Dr. Isaac Funk, head of the publishing house of Funk & Wagnalls, is so
impressed with manifestations he has received from the spirit of Henry
Ward Beecher that he has laid the entire matter before the Boston
Society for Psychical Research, and is anxiously awaiting a solution or
explanation of what appears to him, after twenty-five years' study of
the subject, the most remarkable test of the merit of the claims of
spiritualists that has ever come within his observation.”X  Dr. Kenrick's _Ascetick_ was also
mentioned with approbation by this critical specter [the Doctor's work
was no doubt a tenant of the shelf in some favorite publisher's shop];
and Mr. Norris's _Poem on Friendship_, a work, which I doubt, though
honored with a ghost's approbation, we may now seek for as vainly as
Correlli tormented his memory to recover the sonata which the devil
played to him in a dream.”Œ¼Dr. Oldys, his niece, and his servants took some months to transfer
furniture and books from his Dorsetshire parsonage to the quadrangle
of Whitminster, and to get everything into place.”ŒDrayton?”ŒlDuring all the past week, Herminia had but one thought, especially
when riding, driving, or walking abroad.”X  During the protracted progress of the sonata, the two antiquarians
from the Dom Kirche agreed that their engagement--for such they fully
considered it now--should, as yet, not be divulged to anyone, not
even to Herminia, from whom Ernestine had never before had a secret
to withhold.”XP  Dying, as he certainly deemed himself to be, his thoughts flashed
incessantly to her he loved; her whose soft hand might too probably
never be in his again; anon to his boyhood's home in Warwickshire;
the voices of his father and of his dead mother came drowsily to his
ear; the soft English faces of his sisters floated before him.”X"  Eagerly did Charlie Pierrepont await the arrival of the Brieftrager,
or letter-carrier, who brought him a brief note from Heinrich, saying
that he meant to take his sister for a drive that evening, and that
Charlie would find her in the little church at Burtscheid at the hour
of seven.”X  Eastwards the sky was paler and luminous, for the moon was
imminently rising, and even as I looked the red rim of the enormous disc
cut the line of the desert, and on the instant with a curious aptness,
one of the Arabs outside the cafÃ© broke out into that wonderful chant--

    â€œI cannot sleep for longing for thee, O full moon
     Far is thy throne over Mecca, slip down, O beloved, to me.â€

Immediately afterwards I heard the piping monotone of Machmoutâ€™s voice
begin, and in a moment or two I went inside.”Œ_EikÃ¤ tuo esine ollut enÃ¤Ã¤ vain silmiin kuvastuva
kappale, se mongerteli ja puheli hÃ¤nelle.”X%  Eleven was struck by the great old clock in the hall of the Schloss,
and Charlie, who had been awaiting it, watch in hand, took his wax
taper, and softly and swiftly descended the great staircase to the
boudoir of the Countess, a small octagonal apartment that opened off
the drawing-room.”ŒEliphalet
was very learned in spirit lore--perhaps because he owned the haunted
house at Salem, perhaps because he was a Scotchman by descent.”X  Eliphalet Duncan used to spend most of
his summer vacations at Salem, and the ghost never bothered him at all,
for he was the master of the house--much to his disgust, too, because
he wanted to see for himself the mysterious tenant at will of his
property.”X  Eliphalet Duncan went to the White
Mountains, and in the car of the railroad that runs to the top of Mount
Washington he met a classmate whom he had not seen for years, and this
classmate introduced Duncan to his sister, and this sister was a
remarkably pretty girl, and Duncan fell in love with her at first sight,
and by the time he got to the top of Mount Washington he was so deep in
love that he began to consider his own unworthiness, and to wonder
whether she might ever be induced to care for him a little--ever so
little."”Œ@England is bad
enough I know, and English society is all wrong.”ŒOEngland would do nothing of the
kind, said Charlie--what was the Rhine to her?”ŒQEngland would take part in the war, through
the influence of the Crown Princess.”Œ1Ennen pitkÃ¤Ã¤ epÃ¤ilys valtasi
hÃ¤net kokonaan.”ŒAEnnenkuin kÃ¶ysi pÃ¤Ã¤si juoksemaan, oli pallo kierinyt
ympÃ¤ri.”Œ>EnsimÃ¤inen seikka, jonka hÃ¤n huomasi, oli ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n hikosi.”Œ¬Ernestine sat for a time toying with a velvet slipper half on and
half off her pretty foot, and then suddenly she said--

'Oh, Herminia, how can such a man care for me?'”Xc  Ernestine should be his wife at all
risks, even if he carried her off to England; and, in the ardour of
his imagination, he began to marvel whether his father's old place in
Warwickshire would ever be free from those debts which drove him to
become a wanderer, a soldier of fortune, and to feed himself by his
sword in the ranks of the Prussian army.”ŒÆErÃ¤Ã¤n omnibussin aisa oli osunut hÃ¤neen ja yksi hevosista oli
kavioillaan murskannut kolme sormea hÃ¤nen vasemmasta kÃ¤destÃ¤Ã¤n -- ja
juuri ne sormet, jotka hÃ¤n ampui porroh-mieheltÃ¤ poikki.”ŒÝErÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ hÃ¤nen serkkunsa Arnold --

pahempia ihmiskÃ¤den irvikuvia kuin sammakon, oli sillÃ¤ kuparilla
koristettu luinen sauva.”XÔ  Even the Countess forgot her Spitz pug, and a piece of mysterious
crochet, that seemed endless as the web of Penelope, while listening
to the news, and far away from her peaceful home her thoughts
followed her son, to where in the fields, the lanes, the valleys, and
pretty hamlets of Alsace and Lorraine, and in places then rendered
deserts, there lay in hundreds--yea, in thousands--the hopes of
families, the heads of homes, the source of many a broken heart!”ŒREven those that are born in England become foreigners after

BANSHEES[E]

Of all Irish ghosts, fairies, or bogles, the Banshee (sometimes called
locally the "Boh[=ee]ntha" or "Bank[=ee]ntha") is the best known to the
general public: indeed, cross-Channel visitors would class her with
pigs, potatoes, and other fauna and flora of Ireland, and would expect
her to make manifest her presence to them as being one of the sights of
the country.”X†  Faith's nestles in a hollow of wooded hill up
on the north bank of the river Fawn in the county of Hampshire, huddling
close round its gray Norman church as if for spiritual protection
against the fays and fairies, the trolls and "little people," who might
be supposed still to linger in the vast empty spaces of the New Forest,
and to come after dusk and do their doubtful businesses.”X.  Fathoms deep below it, and now many
hundred yards out, lies what was once the second port in England; but
now of the ancient town of Dunwich, and of its seven great churches,
nothing remains but one, and that ruinous and already half destroyed by
the falling cliff and the encroachments of the sea.”Œ…Finally, he has compiled from the
newspapers, as typically American, many ghost stories of New York and
other parts of the country.”X  Finding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain, and fearing that his
bite might be as venomous in that state as in the madness of
hydrophobia, I left him alone, placed my weapons on the table beside the
fire, seated myself, and recommenced my Macaulay.”X  Fires broke out in the
huts, and even on the clothes, of the natives--and--and I admit I
have read, in the course of my studies,â€--he made a gesture towards
his books and heavily laden table,--â€œof the Yezidis of Syria evoking
phantoms by means of cutting their bodies with knives during their
whirling dances--enormous globes of fire which turned into monstrous
and terrible forms--and I remember an account somewhere, too, how the
emaciated forms and pallid countenances of the spectres, that appeared
to the Emperor Julian, claimed to be the true Immortals, and told him
to renew the sacrifices of blood â€˜for the fumes of which, since the
establishment of Christianity, they had been piningâ€™--that these were
in reality the phantoms evoked by the rites of blood.â€

Both Dr.”Œ@First she thought vaguely that the soldier looked like her Hugh.”ŒúFor I had imagined an utterly lonely and solitary habitation;
instead, scarce half a mile away, down the steep brae-side at the top of
which stood our commodious farm-house, ran a typically Scotch village
street, the hamlet no doubt of Achnaleish.”X‹  For Mr Bagot appears to
have explored every corner of the country, and to have associated with

  =THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD.= By E. S. STEVENS.”ŒâFor in Egypt, while to despoil
the bodies of ancient kings and priests is a privilege for which
advanced and learned societies vie with each other, to rob the corpses
of your contemporaries, is considered the deed of a dog.”Xó  For myself--I was one of the
tenants--I would far prefer living in a workhouse to inhabiting those
low-pitched oak-panelled rooms, and I would sooner look from my garret
windows on to the squalor and grime of Whitechapel than from the
diamond-shaped and leaded panes of the Manor of Trevor Major on to the
boskage of its cool thickets, and the glimmering of its clear
chalk-streams where the quick trout glance among the waving water-weeds
and over the chalk and gravel of its sliding rapids.”XS  For the purpose of
putting this in, he was going down to a small cottage of his near
Godalming, where he had built in the garden a sort of outdoor studio, an
erection betwixt a room and a mere shelter, with the side to the north
entirely open, and flanked by this green trellis which was now one
immense constellation of purple stars.”ŒTFor what ages ago, their vile policy won--
    Of Strasburg, of Metz, and Lorraine.”Xô  For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost
immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a
subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the
London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the
Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be
something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on
the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of
a cane.”ŒFour years ago there died in Washington an old gentleman who had been
employed for thirty-five years in the Library of Congress.”Œ‡Francis Assheton and Louis Fielder were up at Cambridge together, and
there formed the friendship that lasted nearly till their death.”Œ¾Frank and he saw each other
across the bushes and garden-beds, and each quickening his step, they
met suddenly face to face round an angle of the garden walk, in the
fragrance of syringa.”ŒŠFrank busied himself for a little after the other had gone, moving the
table back under the awning of the veranda and quenching the lamp.”Œ»Frank was able to teach him
various games he had not known in Ireland, and he was apt at learning
them; apt, too, at his books, though he had had little or no regular
teaching at home.”ŒhFrankenburg is situated on the summit of a tall rock that towers
above the line of the Antwerp railway.”XÓ  From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was
lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry
Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured
blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to
bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then
the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,
producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of
those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of
an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of
swiftness and motion.”X˜  From the suddenness and efficiency of these arrangements, it was
clear 'that Count Bismarck and his master had been long and actively
preparing for war, and had not been entirely absorbed in peaceful and
innocent designs, as we were constantly assured by certain writers in
this country, who desired to present France to the world as a crafty
and ravening wolf, and Prussia a meek and inoffensive lamb.'”ŒÅFrom the surgeon of a Prussian regiment at SaarbrÃ¼ck, Charlie
Pierrepont got a medical certificate, to the effect that he was
incapable of rejoining the Thuringians, or of serving for some time.”ŒºFrom there you can telephone to
Stockholm and get a telegram sent without delay.â€

I sent him down to get the boat ready, and seized the opportunity
myself to run and wake Maloney.”X’  GAVONâ€™S EVE


It is only the largest kind of ordnance map that records the existence
of the village of Gavon, in the shire of Sutherland, and it is perhaps
surprising that any map on whatever scale should mark so small and
huddled a group of huts, set on a bare, bleak headland between moor and
sea, and, so one would have thought, of no import at all to any who did
not happen to live there.”ŒÉGHOSTS IN CONNECTICUT

disasters to France that never ended till the Prussian drums woke the
echoes of the Arc de Triomphe at Paris.”ŒiGet you to bed.â€

Machmout trotted obediently out of the room, and Weston closed the door
after him.”XÚ  Had Mrs. Veal's visit to her friend happened in our time, the conductors
of the daily press would have given the word, and seven gentlemen unto
the said press belonging, would, with an obedient start, have made off
for Kingston, for Canterbury, for Dover,--for Kamchatka if
necessary,--to pose the Justice, cross-examine Mrs. Bargrave, confront
the sober and understanding kinswoman, and dig Mrs. Veal up from her
grave, rather than not get to the bottom of the story.”ŒHalf-drunken voices could be heard still intermingled with a last,
hearty laugh over a joke of the fool from Prague echoing across the
table.”Œ+Hautarakennuksethan ovat yleensÃ¤ valkosia.”ŒXHe
would not, for worlds, have cost that warm, wilful, and impassioned
heart one pang!”Œ#He could be made
a Titan or a toy.”X‚  He drank wine whenever he could get it, he ate food during the
days of Ramadan, scornful of the fact, when his appetite desired it, he
was supposed to have the evil eye, and in his last moments he was
attended by the notorious Achmet, who is well known here to be practised
in Black Magic, and has been suspected of the much meaner crime of
robbing the bodies of those lately dead.”ŒzHe enjoys, perhaps, the most notable bit of
superstition to be found anywhere in this country, in or out of
Connecticut.”ŒsHe explained quietly that he did not belong
here, but was making a tour of the parishes of WÃ¼rttemberg and Baden.”ŒÜHe feared to
write to Herminia, lest his handwriting might be recognised by the
Countess, and to write to Ernestine would too probably be useless, as
her correspondence was too probably under her mother's supervision.”Xe  He had been kept uninformed, so far as Herminia knew, of her aversion
to his son, and her very decided preference for a certain obscure
Herr Mansfeld, whose image was rising painfully before her, as she,
too, from time to time, looked down on the distant view, to where the
spires of the Dom Kirche of Aix rose darkly up amid the ruddy haze of
evening.”Œ…He had but one desire and craving--to get
as far away from Frankenburg as possible, though it was the cage that
held his love-bird!”ŒQHe had just turned round to say something when
the door opened and Sibyl ran in.”ŒžHe had telephoned to me that very
morning, and even through the disguise of the miles of wire the thrill
of incalculable adventure had sounded in his voice.”X¶  He had the
mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not
allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been
subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the
Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human
bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green
jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular
sweetness.”ŒHe had then the courage to inhabit the house
himself for a month, and a quieter, better-conditioned house could not
be found in all London.”Œ’He had told her about the Duncan Banshee, and the idea of having
an ancestral ghost in personal attendance on her husband tickled her
immensely.”Œ|He has been summering in Connecticut, and he avers
that his talk about native superstition is founded on close observation.”ŒÆHe has, of course, the right to speak
authoritatively, and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack in
Pansay's head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and
pressed him to death.”ŒÅHe is a wonderful hale and hearty
old fellow for his great age; but he married late in life, and has
only had a silver wedding, when his comrade, old Field-Marshal
Wrangel, has had a golden one.”Œ„He kept his hands in the
pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the
gesture with which he had been greeted.”Œ±He knew she would be frightened out of
her wits if the house ghost revealed itself to her, and he saw at once
that it would be impossible to go to Salem on their wedding trip.”ŒVHe knew that his letter would be delivered by the post at Frankenburg
in the morning.”ŒWHe maintains that overwork slew Pansay who died under
his hands about three years ago.”ŒHe marched
along, picking his way delicately, but with a stately dignity that
suggested his ancestry with the majesty of Egypt.”X  He paid some attention to the
management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself
for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of
having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of
burning wood on his own hearth.”Œ®He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of
extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la
vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.”X  He procured from Paris no less than
nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in
different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the
changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have
almost entirely lost control.”X
  He read
of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _cafÃ©_ at Smyrna
where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned
merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each
other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps
tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by
the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red
ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small
beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood
over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell
of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the
â€œ_monstre charmant_â€ that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.”ŒEHe saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian
convolvulus.”Xé  He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not
its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their
true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one
mystical, and in ambergris that stirred oneâ€™s passions, and in violets
that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the
brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often
to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several
influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;
of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that
sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to
be able to expel melancholy from the soul.”ŒxHe soon found himself
regularly installed and adopted, an _ami du maison_, with this
delightful family at Frankenburg.”ŒMHe thanked Heaven that there was this impending war with France
before them.”X
  He thought once more of the still, religious atmosphere that hung
over the little forest community like a veil, barring the distressful
world; of the picturesque ceremonies at Easter, Christmas, and New
Year; of the numerous feast-days and charming little festivals.”ŒHe thought only of
Sibyl.”ŒÒHe threw open the breech of the weapon to insert another cartridge;
but ere he could close it, Pierrepont, quick as thought, snatched a
needle-gun from the nearest soldier, took steady aim at him, and
fired.”X\  He took a friend down with him--a young
fellow who had been in the regular army since the day Fort Sumter was
fired on, and who thought that after four years of the little
unpleasantness down South, including six months in Libby, and after ten
years of fighting the bad Indians on the plains, he wasn't likely to be
much frightened by a ghost.”ŒÝHe varied his
methods of attack: for some of his victims he lay in wait, and to see
his horrible face--it was yellowish white, I may remark--peering round
the wings made me think of the Vampyre in Fuseli's foul sketch.”ŒªHe was
closely shaven, all save a thick moustache, and he had tender brown
eyes--tender, at least, when they looked into those of Herminia, who
was now weeping freely.”Œ‘He was
conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his motherâ€™s nature,
and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibylâ€™s happiness.”X5  He was
rather too liberal to him in the matter of trinkgeld (drink money);
thus the britzka was driven at a thundering rate down that basin of
beautiful hills which surround Aix, while Heinrich waved his
forage-cap, and sung verses from the war-song of Arndt:

  'My own Fatherland, my brave Germany on!”Œ÷He was a Cambridge man, who had come specially from
Toulouse to see St. Bertrand's Church, and had left two friends, who
were less keen archÃ¦ologists than himself, in their hotel at Toulouse,
under promise to join him on the following morning.”ŒUHe was a New Yorker, but
he said he'd sooner go to Boston than see that ghost again.”ŒkHe was a prime favourite with the Countess from his general
_bonhommie_ of manner; and with Ernestine--ah!”Xq  He was conscious enough of the tombs and cypresses, the pillars and
obelisks, standing grimly up from the snow-clad graves; of the dusky
outlines of various distant buildings; of red lights streaming from
windows out upon the gloom; and he could see the pale silver crescent
of the new moon peeping sharply up above the black outline of the
Schloss of Frankenburg.”ŒHe was examining
a large dark picture that hangs behind the altar, one of a series
illustrating the miracles of St. Bertrand.”ŒfHe was now within a very short distance of Frankenburg; but how was
he to communicate with Ernestine?”Œ˜He was on the way home when it happened, crossing northern France from
some mountain trip or other where he buried himself solitary-wise
every summer.”Œ×He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the
great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the
mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: â€œHow horrid of Henry Wotton to be
so late!”Œ¾He was selfish enough to have looked with stern,
black, and utter discouragement on any swain who had no high rank;
then how much more with anger on a penniless soldier of Fortune--a
sub.”ŒvHe was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a
polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.”XC  He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth
and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was
said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the
smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another
gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.”ŒßHe was, in fact, a very stout, bald-headed, and rather
coarsely featured old Teuton, with a red ribbon (of course) at his
button-hole, and a thick plain hoop on his marital finger, as all
married men wear one in Germany.”ŒÆHe, on a certain spring day not many years since, was in London for a
few days upon business connected principally with the furnishing of
the house which he had just finished building at Rendcomb.”Œ_HeidÃ¤n keskustelunsa esine oli suuri terÃ¤spallo, jonka halkasija oli
ehkÃ¤ yhdeksÃ¤n jalkaa.”X(  HeidÃ¤n mielestÃ¤Ã¤n on aivan mahdollista, ettÃ¤ syvÃ¤n meren
pohjalla elÃ¤Ã¤ jÃ¤rkeviÃ¤, vettÃ¤ hengittÃ¤viÃ¤ luurankoisia elÃ¤imiÃ¤, jotka
ovat tottuneet alhaiseen lÃ¤mpÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤Ã¤n ja kovaan paineeseen ja ovat niin
raskasrakenteisia, etteivÃ¤t elÃ¤vinÃ¤ eivÃ¤tkÃ¤ kuolleina nouse pinnalle.”Œ´Heinrich began again--

'Herminia says that Ernestine has never closed an eye since last
night, which I am sorry to say, because if troubles can be slept upon
they are curable.”X6  Heinrich had fairly won his lovely cousin--under 'false colours,'
certainly; but, nevertheless, he _had_ won her; perhaps, from the
girl's peculiar temperament and pride, he might never have done so
otherwise; but having so won her, he was compelled to be thankful,
for with this odious French war on the _tapis_--a war which, but for
his love, he would have hailed with genuine German ardour, and the
95th under 'orders of readiness' for the Rhine--marriage, as Herminia
herself had said, was not to be thought of: so they had but to trust
to time and wait.”Œ*Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.”Œ€Her husband always called her the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate in Camp,
because it was her duty, among others, to pipe all hands to meals.”Œ±Her lover had confidently
promised to see her again, and to follow her to Frankenburg; but she
had seen nothing of him, and no letter or note, however brief, had
reached her.”ŒWHer mother, Selde, still sat on the same chair on which
she had sunk down an hour ago.”ŒHHer name was Victoria,
and she had a perfect mania for going to church.”X  Her tears began to flow again, and she said:

'It is in vain that the Graf storms, and that mamma tells me every
vow that has passed between us must be forgotten, that when you left
Frankenburg you lost all claim on me, and I was, and am, perfectly
free.”Œ Here she was at home;
in London she became some one concealed by clothes, an artificial doll
overdressed and moving by clockwork, only a portion of her alive.”Xp  Here you looked
up the gap in the fir-trees into a crimson sunset; here the garden, trim
and carefully tended, dozed beneath some languid summer noon; here an
angry wreath of storm-cloud brooded over the meadow where the
trout-stream ran grey and leaden below a threatening sky, while another,
the most careful and arresting of all, was a study of the brick-kiln.”X®  Herminia bathed her face and hands with eau-de-cologne and water,
gave a finishing touch to her hair, kissed the envelope which
contained the now dry and faded leaves of Ludwig's rose, placed it in
her soft white bosom as a charm to strengthen her for the purpose she
had in hand, and descended noiselessly to the drawing-room, when the
sound of several voices, laughing loudly, jarred sorely on her ears
and excited nerves.”Œ½Herminia grew deadly pale, and took advantage of the Countess
hurrying out upon the terrace to retire to her own room, whither,
however, her watchful aunt almost immediately followed her.”XÜ  Herminia looked waggish, Heinrich
somewhat provoked, as he deemed the suitor too old, and that his
sister's wishes should be consulted; while Ernestine--whose toilette
(a golden-coloured silk, trimmed with black lace), a most becoming
one for a brunette, had been made under the critical eye of her
mother--looked pale, 'worried,' and worn, and, like Heinrich,
provoked too, for, as we have said elsewhere, she was a self-willed
little beauty, and somewhat opinionated.”ŒHerminia now wept bitterly.”ŒªHerminia shook her head mournfully, and said, 'I pray to Heaven that
it may be so, and with the hope these words inspire, I must now,
dear, dear Ludwig, say--farewell!'”Xy  Herminia was dazzlingly fair, of a pure Saxon type, with
hair of that lovely brown tint which seems shot with gold in the
sunshine, and soft eyes of violet-blue, that seemed almost black at
night, and though brown her tresses, and wondrously fair her skin,
her eyelashes and eyebrows were dark, almost black; but her pretty
little nose bordered rather on the _retroussÃ©_.”XV  Herminia was right; the girl, indeed, a close observer, was seldom
wrong in her deductions, for 'Herr Carl Pierrepont' was hopelessly
smitten at last by Ernestine, who, like the lively blonde, her
cousin, was rich in those charms, and mere than all, those pretty
mannerisms, or tricks of women, that win and secure a man's love for
ever.”ŒêHerr Lieutenant Pierrepont fell, it is
believed, mortally wounded----'

The Baron paused and changed colour; the Countess grew pale, but with
a smile of grim satisfaction on her lips; the Count said:

'Poor fellow--poor fellow!'”Œ[Herra Whibble kertoo sekavan jutun, jossa
puhutaan sen lÃ¶ytÃ¤misen tapahtuneen satamassa.”Œ-Hetken kuluttua hÃ¤n nousi ja otti pyssynsÃ¤.”ŒHetki hetken perÃ¤Ã¤n kului ja
Elstead kauhistui, kun kelloa katsoessaan huomasi, ettÃ¤ happea oli enÃ¤Ã¤
neljÃ¤ksi tunniksi.”Œ–Heâ€™s
been with your father for months now.â€

â€œBut that was in London; and up here itâ€™s different--I mean, I feel
that it may be different.”ŒMHiljaa kohosi hÃ¤n istualleen ja veti revolverinsa esiin
pÃ¤Ã¤naluksen alta.”X‰  His
father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and
Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a
capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at
Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by
reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,
and his inordinate passion for pleasure.”Xi  His brigade was among the first troops actively
employed, with orders to occupy the line of the Saar, resting its
right on SaarbrÃ¼ck, with advanced posts at that place and in the
schloss of the Princes of Nassau, at Saarlouis, which had been
fortified by Vauban, at Bliescastle, where the Prussians and French
fought a great battle in 1793, and at Merzig.”X   His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco;
his foot-gear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on
the floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had
considered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have
missed its meaning.”ŒÄHis eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily
embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century
Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.”XN  His father left him with enough
money to give him a start, and a strong feeling of pride in his Scotch
birth; you see there was a title in the family in Scotland, and although
Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger son, yet he always
remembered, and always bade his only son to remember, that his ancestry
was noble.”Œ_His father was a Scotchman, who had come over and settled
in Boston, and married a Salem girl.”Œ’His mother left him her full share of Yankee grit, and a
little house in Salem which has belonged to her family for more than two
hundred years.”ŒøHis place was outside the village of Bircham, ten miles
out from Norwich; and thereâ€™s a long straight bit of road there--thatâ€™s
where he ran over the child--and a couple of hundred yards farther on, a
rather awkward turn into the park gates.”Œ$His valet had gone to bed.... Paris!”ŒHitto, kuinka te muutuitte!...”ŒHoch Germania!'”ŒBHow I then loathed the name of Heinrich--it
seems wonderful now!'”ŒEHow eagerly she hoped that he would be detained for months at Berlin!”ŒÜHow he longed to show the latter to his sisters; for Charlie had
three, in that dear old home in Warwickshire, all softly featured and
gently mannered girls, such as England excels in, more than all the
world besides.”ŒuHow many men yet were to perish among the blushing
vineyards of Champagne, and under the beleaguered walls of Paris!”ŒÈHow much, thought Charlie, were Herminia and her cousin to be envied;
they had been, and were, so successful in their love, and all through
the fortunate little scheme of the Countess and Ernestine.”X7  How the
'Marseillaise' was being sung, and the hotel of the Prussian
ambassador was only saved from total destruction by the intervention
of the gendarmerie; for the time had now come when the Prussians
spoke exultingly of Leipzig, even as the French did of Jena, and also
raised the cry of 'To the Rhine!'”X«  However, she had Charlie's ring on her finger, and a curly lock of
his hair in a gold locket, reposing in the cleft of her white bosom,
all unknown to the Herr Baron, and to all, save Herminia, who could
now see the blue ribbon at which it hung encircling her slender neck;
and in her bosom, too, she had his last letter, a mere scrap, but
full of love and truth and great tenderness; and yet he wrote of pay
and poverty.”Œ+However, that was all Narboroughâ€™s fault.”ŒwHowever, they were a link between him
and Frankenburg, so he could not help listening intently to whatever
they said.”ŒÈHuomaisi ehkÃ¤, etteivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen
kasvonsa, enempÃ¤Ã¤ kuin useimpain muittenkaan ihmisten, ole aivan
tasasuhtaiset: oikea silmÃ¤ on hiukan suurempi kuin vasen ja leuan oikea

forget the details of great-great-grandmamma Bridget, but she certainly
cut the throat of some distant relation before she disembowelled herself
with the axe that had been used at Agincourt.”Œ=I
forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century.”Œ^I am
off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see
you before I left.”ŒEI am the Grafine Ernestine of
Frankenburg, and such I shall remain.'”ŒBI am therefore
          going to my brother-in-law at Melbourne.”Œ I am told that
pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after
politics.â€

â€œIs she pretty?â€

â€œShe behaves as if she was beautiful.”Œ‚(I am very angry) she heard the Countess
exclaim, as the door closed, and then she heard her cousin make some
laughing response.”Œ‹I arrived at Victoria about eleven, and took the underground to Sloane
Square in order to see if you were in town and would give me lunch.”Œ•I assure you that it is an education to visit it.â€

â€œBut must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?â€ asked Mr.
Erskine plaintively.”ŒÞI believe there is no society of any kind in the
Coloniesâ€”nothing that I would call societyâ€”so when you have made your

â€œSociety!â€ muttered the lad.”Œ†I believe, according to the peerage, it is

Weston had got up, and, like me, was hanging on Machmoutâ€™s words.”Œ=I donâ€™t suppose I shall ever see
this horrid London again.”Œ-I feel to-night the happiest man in Germany.'”ŒµI felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with
its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as
you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.”Œ>I go on board to-night for
India, and I must do my job first.”ŒÛI had been in London in this year, up till the end of July, and during
the first week in August went down to stay with a friend in a house he
had taken for the summer months, in the Ashdown Forest district of
Sussex.”ŒkI had drawn
you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsmanâ€™s cloak and
polished boar-spear.”X  I had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as
the name borne by a dazzling charlatan who had made a great sensation in
London for a year or so, and had fled the country on the charge of a
double murder within his own house--that of his mistress and his rival.”X  I had joined a previously-arrived party of five, all of us old friends,
and accustomed to see each other often, and at dinner, and afterwards in
intervals of bridge, the conversation roamed agreeably over a variety of
topics, rocking-turns and the prospects of weather (a thing of vast
importance in Switzerland, and not a commonplace subject) and the
performances at the opera, and under what circumstances as revealed in
dummyâ€™s hand, is it justifiable for a player to refuse to return his
partnerâ€™s original lead in no trumps.”ŒLI hastened to say that
I was more than satisfied, fearing the fate of Esau.”ŒqI have
been no prude or Puritan in my own life, and I hope I have not turned a
Pharisaical shoulder on sinners.”ŒGI have a letter from Herminia, Carl,

the sort of man to have gone to them.”ŒêI laughed too, for the way he called me 'madam'
sounded so odd, here in this empty room at midnight in a London street,
but my laughter stopped dead and merged in a flood of weeping when I saw
how my change of feeling affected him.”ŒI left London early, for John Clinton was to meet me at Forest
Row Station, and we were going to spend the day golfing, and go to his

deep down in some spiritual distress, and----â€

â€œBut the symptoms first, please, my dear Svenska,â€ he interrupted, with
a strangely compelling seriousness of manner, â€œand your deductions

She turned round sharply on the edge of her chair and looked him in the
face, lowering her voice to prevent her emotion betraying itself too
obviously.”Œ4I met his
father yesterday in St. Jamesâ€™s Street.”X’  I must content myself with stating that it largely
referred to common acquaintances, e.g., to the nephew of Mr. Denton's
friend who had recently married and settled in Chelsea, to the
sister-in-law of Mr. Denton's friend who had been seriously
indisposed, but was now better, and to a piece of china which Mr.
Denton's friend had purchased some months before at a price much below
its true value.”XÃ  I perceive, these lords
    At this encounter do so much admire
    That they devour their reason and scarce think
    Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
    Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
    Been justled from your senses, know for certain
    That I am Prospero and that very duke
    Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
    Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
    To be the lord on't.”Œ|I returned to England
last year, on inheriting the fortune of an uncle, among whose
possessions was the house in question.”ŒŒI roused myself--laid the letters on the table--stirred up the fire,
which was still bright and cheering--and opened my volume of Macaulay.”ŒdI saw Herminia for a little time to-day, and she desired
me to assure you of her fullest sympathy.'”Xc  I saw again Anubis, the
dog-faced deity, and the children of Horus, eternal watcher of the
ages, as they swathed Osiris, the first mummy of the world, in the
scented and mystic bands, and I tasted again something of the ecstasy
of the justified soul as it embarked in the golden Boat of Ra, and
journeyed onwards to rest in the fields of the blessed.”Œ¡I shall go
through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the
eligible young ladies.â€

â€œWith their ages, Lady Narborough?â€ asked Dorian.”Œ’I should have told you

brother-in-law were just come down from London to see her.”ŒXI suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has
been seen in San Francisco.”ŒŸI think it right that you should know that the
most dreadful things are being said against you in London.â€

â€œI donâ€™t wish to know anything about them.”X  I think the dressing-bell has
sounded.â€




OUTSIDE THE DOOR


The rest of the small party staying with my friend Geoffrey Aldwych in
the charming old house which he had lately bought at a little village
north of Sheringham on the Norfolk coast had drifted away soon after
dinner to bridge and billiards, and Mrs Aldwych and myself had for the
time been left alone in the drawing-room, seated one on each side of a
small round table which we had very patiently and unsuccessfully been
trying to turn.”Xº  I thought
I could have placed my confidence in Elizar, and yet this very
morning--Christmas morning too, of all the blessed days in the
year--with the bells a ringing and--and--all like that--I say, this
very morning, had it not have been for Providence watching over us
all, that girl would have put--indeed I may go so far to say, 'ad put
the cheese on your breakfast table----" He saw I was about to speak,
and waved his hand at me.”Œ€I told you that there was a title in the family in
Scotland, and that Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger
son.”ŒCI trust you will return from Australia in a
position of affluence.”Œ]I trust, Herminia, you will receive my dear boy
with all the affection he so justly merits.'”Œ_I tumbled
off my horse and dashed, half fainting, into Peliti's for a glass of
cherry-brandy.”Œ}I used to sit up with Pansay sometimes when
Heatherlegh was called out to visit patients and I happened to be within
claim.”Œ;I want to be
forgiven.â€™ Itâ€™s a hoax, my dear Teesdale.”ŒzI was
"strung up" to a high degree of expectation and listened every moment
to hear the panpipes and the Roo-too-too-it.”ŒŽI was
furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds
of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona.”X(  I was just about to motion the spirit of Black Magic to make his
appearance, when Machmoutâ€™s words came into my head: â€œHe has with him
the Black Magic which can raise the dead,â€ and sudden overwhelming
curiosity, which froze disgust and horror into chill unfeeling things,
came over me.”ŒgI well remember the
loneliness and intolerable Heimweh of it at first.â€ His German was very
fluent.”Œ¸I wish I could afford to do the same.â€

â€œThey say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,â€ chuckled Sir
Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humourâ€™s cast-off clothes.”ŒeI wish I could believe that he had come to such a
really romantic end as you suggest, but I canâ€™t.”Œ5I wish now
that I was not going to Australia at all.”ŒnI wish the house I
have resided in at Paris to be converted into a chapel of St.
Dominique, my patron saint.”Œ$I'm
on the Blessington lower road."”X2  II

A few days later the humorist and his wife, with minds greatly
relieved, moved into a small furnished house placed at their free
disposal in another part of London; and John Silence, intent upon his
approaching experiment, made ready to spend a night in the empty house
on the top of Putney Hill.”Œ£IV

Although nothing John Silence did ever took me, properly speaking, by
surprise, it was certainly unexpected to find a letter from Stockholm
waiting for me.”ŒlIf Hugh
was gone forever, then with him had gone all her love of living, her
courage, all her better self.”Œ…If I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a present for any
emperor that ever trod on neat's-leather.”Œ>If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting.”ŒŽIf my conjecture proved to be correct,
he was to place a light in the window of my room, which I should see
returning after dark from Lairg.”Œ<If one doesnâ€™t talk about a thing, it
has never happened.”X  If thou be'st Prospero,
    Give us particulars of thy preservation;
    How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
    Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
    How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
    My dear son Ferdinand.”ŒrIf thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee by the
lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs, these are they.”ŒUIf thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
    How thou camest here thou mayst.”Œ§Immediately opposite Peliti's shop my eye
was arrested by the sight of four _jhampanies_ in black and white
livery, pulling a yellow-paneled, cheap, bazar 'rickshaw.”ŒImogen is waiting for me.”XÍ  In
his leisure hours Dr Teesdale was a considerable student of the occult,
for like most advanced and proficient physicians, he clearly recognised
how narrow was the boundary of separation between soul and body, how
tremendous the influence of the intangible was over material things,
and it presented no difficulty to his mind that a disembodied spirit
should be able to communicate directly with those who still were bounded
by the finite and material.”Œ In
marked cases it was labelled as kleptomania, but he was convinced there
were many others which did not fall directly under the dictation of
physical need.”XÑ  In Alphonsoâ€™s
Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real
jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of
Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes â€œwith
collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.â€ There was a gem in
the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and â€œby the exhibition
of golden letters and a scarlet robeâ€ the monster could be thrown into
a magical sleep and slain.”X‚  In Lodgeâ€™s strange
romance â€˜A Margarite of Americaâ€™, it was stated that in the chamber of
the queen one could behold â€œall the chaste ladies of the world,
inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites,
carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.â€ Marco Polo had seen the
inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the
dead.”Œ"In Sybilâ€™s own room they parted.”XY  In a letter from Heinrich to her, Ernestine had been told the story
of the strangely coincident dreams; and to a romantic and
enthusiastic girl like her--one deeply imbued, too, with German
mysticism--the idea that she had thus communed and met, and might
again commune with and meet her lover in the spirit, was a source of
the purest joy.”Œ\In fact, he was
acquainted with the habits of every reputable spook in the Scotch
peerage.”X„  In his letter there was no mention of Carl Pierrepont, and no
enclosure for _her_, thought Ernestine; but then, as Heinrich wrote
to the Countess, he could not make a communication concerning him; so
the girl, though her joy for her brother's safety was somewhat
clouded by that circumstance and the wish that Heinrich had written
to Herminia; could but wait and hope--hope and pray.”Xa  In his sorrow for
the loss he had sustained, and for the terrible emotions which he
knew she would be feeling--torn from him on one hand, and menaced by
a hateful marriage on the other--he could almost have wept, and
perhaps would have done so, but for a glow of wrath and indignation,
at the manner in which the imperious Countess had treated him.”Œ¢In one rifle-pit alone there lay seven hundred and
eighty-one corpses; the chateau of Colombey was taken and recaptured
three times at the point of the bayonet.”Œ:In strictness this woman could hardly be termed a Banshee.”Œ×In ten years his
knowledge should be doubled, and at the end of twenty he knows, or knows
something about, almost every Englishman in the Empire, and may travel
anywhere and everywhere without paying hotel-bills.”ŒµIn that moment the campaign in Alsace and Lorraine, danger, duty,
wound, and suffering, were all forgotten; nothing was in his mind but
the intense happiness of the event to come.”X;  In the ardour of the pursuit, or in terror of the dreadful sounds
which shook the air, the horse ridden by Heinrich, having got the bit
of the bridle firmly wedged between his teeth for a time, darted with
his rider to the front at racing speed, and fairly carried him
through the line of the retreating French!”ŒÎIn the evening after Rhineberg had withdrawn, the Countess, whose
mind was still running on her daughter's evident emotion at the name
of Burtscheid, gave vent to the anger and suspicion that excited her.”Œ0In the name of Satan, if necessary, what
is it?”X6  In the old ivied tower at Frankenburg she showed him the window of
the room in which the third wife of Charlemagne, Fastrada, daughter
of Count Raoul, died, while the Emperor was absent at Frankfort; and
told how he caused her body, which was so fair and beautiful, to the
end that it might never decay, to be enclosed in a coffin of the
purest crystal, which he kept in that chamber, and he never quitted
it by day or by night, neglecting his empire and government, and
forgetting all the concerns of war or peace, till Turpin the Wise
resolved to cure him.”X  In this
brightness, too, of sun and sea-wind I felt none of the _malaise_ at my
waking moments which a sleepless night usually gives me; I felt
particularly well, particularly pleased to be alive, and also, as I have
said, particularly content not to be going to Bircham.”XN  Indeed, Ernestine admitted that she had heard her
sighing and moaning in her sleep, and Herminia had quitted her couch
that morning resolving to appeal to the chivalry, the manhood, the
charity, and honour of her cousin to release her from the yoke, the
thraldom his family had placed upon her, even with the loss of her
fortune.”Œ=Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in
Paris.”Œ^Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger
of Sibylâ€™s position.”ŒSIs there a
single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?”Œ'Is this fellow
Mansfeld good-looking?'”ŒÄIt
was a cosy supper and a well-cooked one that we sat down to and ate
under the stars, and, according to the clergyman, the only meal fit to
eat we had seen since we left London a week before.”X  It
was afterward learned that he had hidden, almost undoubtedly, $6000
worth of registered United States bonds among the books in his
sub-cellar den--presumably, concealed between the leaves of some of the
moth-eaten volumes of which he was the appointed guardian.”X1  It
was in such a sale-room that the remarkable series of events began
which were detailed to me not many months ago by the person whom they
principally affected, namely, Mr. James Denton, M.A., F.S.A., etc.,
etc., some time of Trinity Hall, now, or lately, of Rendcomb Manor in
the county of Warwick.”ŒÂIt
was no delusion of his senses, either; here in this comfortable room of
his in Bedford Square, with London cheerfully roaring round him, he had
spoken with the spirit of Charles Linkworth.”ŒöIt
was not in the personal appearance of the little, dry, wizened old man
that the interest lay, for he was precisely like dozens of other
church-guardians in France, but in a curious furtive, or rather hunted
and oppressed, air which he had.”ŒÎIt
was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a
low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with
thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade.”X  It drew
attention to the following paragraph:

INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.â€”An inquest was held this morning at the Bell
Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of
Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,
Holborn.”Œ‰It had been
taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed
had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.”X  It happened that just a week before the Prussians crossed the Rhine,
Adolphe Guerrand had been at Blankenberg with a patient, to whom he
had prescribed sea-bathing, and, when walking on the beach there, had
found a carefully sealed bottle among some sea-weed.”Œ}It has brought you into touch with a somewhat
singular class of Invisible, but of one, I think, chiefly human in
character.”Œ‰It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty
placeâ€”otherwise I wouldnâ€™t bother you about it.â€

â€œNo trouble, sir.”ŒVIt is an odd thing, but every one who
disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.”Œ­It is most unfair.â€

â€œPerhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,â€ said Mr.
Erskine; â€œI myself would say that it had merely been detected.â€

â€œOh!”Œ”It is not devoid of traces
of the influence of that leader of female thought in her day, Miss
Anna Seward, known to some as the Swan of Lichfield.”Œ¯It is related that on
one occasion he nearly frightened to death a watchman who was guarding
the coffin of a Tennessee Senator who was lying in state in the Senate
Chamber.”Œ]It may be a
disappointment to you to learn that Rendcomb Manor was new; that I
cannot help.”X¸  It means
that you are worthy to look on the august and villainous dead,
and you will find yourself shown into some vaulted or tapestried
chamber, without benefit of electric light, and are told that
great-great-grandmamma Bridget occasionally has vague business by the
fireplace, but it is better not to talk to her, and that you will hear
Master Anthony â€œawfully wellâ€ if he attempts the front staircase any
time before morning.”Œ1It might be a
most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.”Œ”It relates to the rifling of a mausoleum in Middlesex which stood in a
park (now broken up), the property of a noble family which I will not
name.”Œ­It stole up from below--an awful blackness that seemed to drink
in all the radiations of light in the building, leaving nothing but
the ghost of a radiance in their place.”ŒfIt was
such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,
and Shakespeare himself.”ŒIt was Romeo and Juliet.”ŒNIt was a New York man who gave expression to this rather
startling statement.”ŒyIt was a great-great-grandfather of Mr.
Eliphalet Hitchcock who was foremost in the time of the Salem witchcraft
craze.”X<  It was a note--merely a note, on scented and tinted paper, for
Ernestine was not above these feminine prettinesses, written in her
graceful style and lady-like hand--to say that he was never absent
from her thoughts, and how she and Herminia had wept and prayed in
secret on the night the army crossed the Rhine.”Œ˜It was a rather curious one of Moorish
workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished
steel, and studded with coarse turquoises.”ŒÙIt was an American paper and
what it recorded was this:

â€œThe body of Mr Silas R. Hume, who committed suicide last week at the
HÃ´tel Beau Site, Moulin sur Chalons, is to be buried at his house in
Boston, Mass.”Œ{It was barely four oâ€™clock, and the sun came down a long vista of blue
islands that led out to the open sea and Finland.”ŒaIt was but
too evident that Herminia had passed a disturbed night, a restless
and feverish day.”ŒìIt was impossible
for the small force in SaarbrÃ¼ck--a mere weak advanced guard--to
withstand the many battalions sent against it by the Emperor,
especially as the attacking force was supported by an entire battery
of mitrailleuses.”X-  It was in the blaze of an evening in July, the air clear as crystal,
the sea a cobalt blue, when we left the steamer on the borders of
civilisation and sailed away with maps, compasses, and provisions for
the little group of dots in the SkÃ¤rgÃ¥rd that were to be our home for
the next two months.”ŒIIt was not a new world, but rather another
chaos, that it created in us.”Xe  It was sent by a
gentleman, a justice of peace, at Maidstone, in Kent, and a very
intelligent person, to his friend in London, as it is here worded; which
discourse is attested by a very sober and understanding gentlewoman, a
kinswoman of the said gentleman's, who lives in Canterbury, within a few
doors of the house in which the within-named Mrs. Bargrave lives; who
believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit, as not to be put
upon by any fallacy; and who positively assured him that the whole
matter, as it is related and laid down, is really true; and what she
herself had in the same words, as near as may be, from Mrs. Bargrave's
own mouth, who, she knows, had no reason to invent and publish such a
story, or any design to forge and tell a lie, being a woman of much
honesty and virtue, and her whole life a course, as it were, of piety.”ŒjIt was strange how the sound of violins and trumpets accorded
with the drolleries of the wit from Prague.”ŒÀIt was tea-time,
and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the
table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at
which the duchess was presiding.”ŒTIt was then about half-past six, and we were just
seventy-eight miles from Dunwich.”ŒTIt was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he
had intended.”ŒDIt was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl
Vane.”Xf  It was true, also, that during the
younger Mrs Linkworthâ€™s absence from home, mother and son had had a
violent quarrel arising originally from some trivial point in household
management, and that in consequence of this, she had actually drawn her
money out of the bank, intending to leave Sheffield next day and settle
in London where she had friends.”Œ‰It was, I believe, my mentioning some juggling tricks
which my brother in the East Indies had seen at the court of the Rajah
of Mysore.”Œ^It went straight towards Joan--and
as it went the girl lifted her head and turned to meet it.”ŒJACKSON, MO., October 6.”ŒÐJa Pollockista tuntui, ettÃ¤ hattu, jota serkku piti
kÃ¤dessÃ¤Ã¤n, ei ollutkaan mikÃ¤Ã¤n hattu, vaan Gorgon-pÃ¤Ã¤, joko tuijotti

epÃ¤selvÃ¤Ã¤ ja kaukaista: niin laajalle, kuin pienestÃ¤ ikkunasta voi

make his way.”ŒÒLittle by little the
weakness--or philosophy--has grown upon him; and not only from every
part of Middlesex County, but from every part of this State he has been
accumulating wagonloads of pebbles and rocks.”Œ4London is very rich in curious effects of that kind.”ŒçLondon was in its usual desperate February plight, when we got back,
full of fogs and still-born frosts that seemed to produce a cold far
more bitter than the piercing temperature of those sunny altitudes from
which we had come.”ŒLook at Osburton.”Xé  Looking round, even at the risk of being struck by a bullet from
behind, he saw him about fifty yards in the rear, in the grasp of a
savage-looking and powerfully built Turco, whose left hand was on
Heinrich's throat, while, with his unfixed bayonet, the socket of
which he grasped dagger-fashion in his right, he was making vain
efforts to stab and thrust--we say vain efforts, for, though Heinrich
had lost his sword in the fray, he had firm possession of the Turco's
right wrist.”X‰  Lord Kildonan was shortly to take up a post
in the Lisbon Embassy, and the boy was unfit to make the voyage: "not
that he is sickly," the Earl wrote, "though you'll find him whimsical,
or of late I've thought him so, and to confirm this, 'twas only
to-day his old nurse came expressly to tell me he was possess'd: but
let that pass; I'll warrant you can find a spell to make all straight.”•      X0  Louis Fielder had his ideas about how I should make my
dÃ©but (for he had ideas on every subject, and all of them original), and
entreated me to come and live not in the stronghold of doctors,
â€˜Chloroform Square,â€™ as he called it, but down in Chelsea, where there
was a house vacant next his own.”Œ*Luonnollisesti se on vaan pelkkÃ¤Ã¤ lorua.”Œ4LÃ¤himmÃ¤t niistÃ¤

_A Notable Novel_

Some years ago there appeared a very notable novel which Mills & Boon
believe has got lost sight of in the rush of Fiction so energetically
published by almost every firm.”ŒîMingled suspicions that he was keeping the
old man from his _dÃ©jeuner_, that he was regarded as likely to make away
with St. Bertrand's ivory crozier, or with the dusty stuffed crocodile
that hangs over the font, began to torment him.”Œ‹MinÃ¤ en tahdo
lukijan arvostelukyvyn valoa johtaa kumpaankaan suuntaan, kerronhan
vaan tarinan sellaisena, kuin sen Plattnerilta kuulin.”ŒfMitenkÃ¤ ilman
keuhkoja voi saada Ã¤Ã¤nen syntymÃ¤Ã¤n, sitÃ¤ ei Elstead yrittÃ¤nytkÃ¤Ã¤n
selittÃ¤Ã¤.”Xn  MitÃ¤ seikkaperÃ¤isimmin kertoi Elstead tÃ¤stÃ¤ kummallisesta kaupungista
ja sen asujista, noista ikuisen yÃ¶n elÃ¤jistÃ¤, jotka eivÃ¤t ole koskaan
nÃ¤hneet aurinkoa, kuuta, tÃ¤hteÃ¤, viheriÃ¤istÃ¤ ruohoa, eivÃ¤tkÃ¤ yhtÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤n
ilmaa hengittÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ olentoa, jotka eivÃ¤t tiedÃ¤ mitÃ¤Ã¤n tulesta eivÃ¤tkÃ¤
muusta valosta kuin elÃ¤vÃ¤in olentojen fosforiloistosta.”ŒKMolemmat miehet olivat
nÃ¤hneet pallon sisustan tÃ¤nÃ¤ aamuna ensi kerran.”X{  More
than once he had been on the verge of speaking, as his curiosity had
been keenly excited, but repressed the inclination; he did not wish
that his presence in Aix should be known to the Countess, and to
address GrÃ¼nthal, his acknowledged rival, or competitor, rather, was
altogether an intolerable idea, so quitting the speise-saal softly,
he hastened to his own room.”X$  Moreover, she had concealed him in her house for two days, and
enabled him to join the regiment before Metz; but the shock to his
system was such that the military surgeons advised his return home
for a time, and that, doubtless, he would spend his Christmas with
them all at Frankenburg.”Œ}Most bells in Oxford rung out for him, being a
     nobleman, and he was buried next night in St. Peter's in the
     East.”X[  Most warmly had Heinrich written to her again and again
about his English comrade, who had once actually fought a duel for
him at Altona, when he was too ill to fight for himself, so Ernestine
was all anxiety to know, receive, and thank him; for she doted on
Heinrich, her only brother, as a loving, tender, and devoted sister
alone can dote.”ŒžMr. Denton laid
before his relative a statement of the results of his visit to
town--particulars of carpets, of chairs, of wardrobes, and of bedroom
china.”Œ‚Mr. French has been
very wide in his choice, giving us these as well as many examples from
the literature of England and France.”ŒÀMr. T.J. Westropp, M.A., has furnished the following story: "My maternal
grandmother heard the following tradition from her mother, one of the
Miss Ross-Lewins, who witnessed the occurrence.”Œ†Mr. Twine dwelt during the
working hours of the day in a sort of cage of iron, like that of
Dreyfus, in the basement of the Capitol.”ŒÛMrs.
Bargrave had removed to Canterbury, and was residing in a house of her
own, when she was suddenly interrupted by a visit from Mrs. Veal, as she
was sitting in deep contemplation of certain distresses of her own.”X  Mrs. Bargrave and Mrs. Veal had been friends in youth, and had protested
their attachment should last as long as they lived; but when Mrs. Veal's
brother obtained an office in the customs at Dover, some cessation of
their intimacy ensued, "though without any positive quarrel."”ŒMustan miehen kosto.”ŒÒMutta jonkun ihmeen kautta se sÃ¤ilyi
krokotiileilta ja sen lÃ¶ysi muuan Ã¤lykÃ¤s puoli-araapialainen, joka
saapui juuri yÃ¶n korvissa kauppaamaan sitÃ¤ Pollockille ja Pereralle
muka merkillisenÃ¤ esineenÃ¤.”ŒÆMutta juttu
kulki, ponnistuksista huolimatta, suurenneltuna ja vÃ¤Ã¤ristettynÃ¤
yhdeksÃ¤ssÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤ssÃ¤ ympÃ¤ri maakunnan ja useat vanhemmat ottivat
poikansa pois koulusta selvillÃ¤ tekosyillÃ¤.”ŒïMutta lopulta hÃ¤neenkin tarttui se
kauhu, jota nuo valkoihoiset nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t tuntevan esinettÃ¤ kohtaan; hÃ¤n
lÃ¤hti tiehensÃ¤ ja kulkiessaan Pollockin hÃ¶kkelin ohi hÃ¤n heitti
taakkansa sinne, josta tÃ¤mÃ¤ sen sitten lÃ¶ysi aamusella.”ŒŸMutta mies halusi saada kaupat pÃ¤Ã¤tetyksi eikÃ¤ Pollock ennÃ¤ttÃ¤nyt estÃ¤Ã¤
hÃ¤ntÃ¤ avaamasta vaatetta ja heittÃ¤mÃ¤stÃ¤ pÃ¶ydÃ¤lle porroh-miehen pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¤.”Œ(Mutta pimeys on ihmisen paras
sotisopa.”Œ Mutta porroh-mies oli hÃ¤vinnyt.”Œ,Mutta sanomansa se kertoi kyllin tuntuvasti.”Œ0Muurahaisia ja
kÃ¤rpÃ¤siÃ¤ kuhisi sen kimpussa.”ŒÆMuuta kerrottavaa ei olekaan kuin se, ettÃ¤ Elstead 2 pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ helmikuuta
1896 toisen kerran laskeutui valtameren syvyyteen niiden kokemusten
opastamana, mitÃ¤ hÃ¤n ensi retkellÃ¤Ã¤n oli saanut.”ŒöMy explanation is that there
isnâ€™t any explanation, for no suggestion on my part would make my
brother go out and ride at the moment when Machmout says he is so doing
(if indeed we find that Machmoutâ€™s visions are chronologically correct).”X
  My great-grandfather served in the Irish Brigade, and on its
dissolution at the time of the French Revolution had the good fortune to
escape the general massacre of officers, and in company with an O'Brien
and a Maguire fled across the frontier and settled in Italy.”X*  Mysticism, with its
marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle
antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a
season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of
the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in
tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the
brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of
the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,
morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.”Œ9MyÃ¶hemmin lupasi hÃ¤n sen
kirjoittaa kokonaisuudessaan.”ŒªMyÃ¶hemmin, kun nÃ¤mÃ¤ vaivat
tulivat, lÃ¶ysi hÃ¤n kuilun keskeltÃ¤ kylmÃ¤n puron ja kallion pehmeÃ¤
sammal, kun hÃ¤n siihen epÃ¤toivoisena ryhtyi, oli hyvÃ¤Ã¤ syÃ¶dÃ¤.”Œ^Nainen oli aivan kuollut ja saatuaan sen selville Pollock astui majan
ovelle ja katseli ulos.”ŒNe kokoontuivat Plattnerin
ympÃ¤rille, tulivat hÃ¤nen eteensÃ¤, tÃ¶rmÃ¤sivÃ¤t hÃ¤nen kasvoihinsa ja
heidÃ¤n hyÃ¶dyttÃ¶mÃ¤n murheensa Ã¤Ã¤ni kaikui ilmassa.”Œ.Ne osaavat kaikenlaisia
kummallisia konsteja.”Œ{Ne seinÃ¤t olivat veden syÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤ puuta, kierrettyÃ¤ kÃ¶yttÃ¤, rautakiskoja,
kuparia ja kuolleitten ihmisten pÃ¤Ã¤kalloja.”Œ0Ne viiltelevÃ¤t kasvojaan pienillÃ¤ veitsillÃ¤."”X²  Near him, under an awning in front of the hotel, seated on hard
wooden stools, at a bare deal table, were some poor
Handwerks-Burschen, or travelling workmen, in blue blouses and wooden
sabots, smoking, drinking beer, and making merry with their wives or
sweethearts, and singing--

  'Draw the social chair yet closer;
    Vow by this full draught of mirth,
  That all evil is forgiven,
    Hell is banished from our earth.'”Œ9Next day saw them off for Frankenburg in an open britzka.”ŒÆNext day the news came that the gentleman near whose gate the
Banshee had cried, was dead, and it was found on inquiry that he had
died at the very hour at which the children had seen the specter.”ŒeNext instant the
watchers looking across the river saw nothing but the flickering lights
in Hardin.”X  Next morning the Countess's carriage took the trio to the
Eisenbahnhof for Aix-la-Chapelle; and as Herminia from the
swift-speeding train looked back to the sinking spires of Cologne, a
curtain seemed to have fallen between her past and present existence.”Œ^Niitten silmÃ¤reijistÃ¤ ja yli koko paikan vilahteli
edestakaisin hopeahohtoisia pikkukaloja.”ŒCNo
niin, tuo pÃ¤Ã¤, josta juuri kerroin teille, on aika konstikas.”ŒNo, I must go, dear Agatha.”X   No, I thought not; no more it
does to me: now, if you'll believe me, I've said as much to those
men--one's the librarian of our Free Libry here, and the other came
down from London on purpose--fifty times, if I have once, but I might
just as well have talked to that bit of stonework.”X  Not
more than a hundred yards off shore it contains a big bleak looking
house which was built about twenty years ago to serve as a Summer hotel
when Connecticut capitalists were deep in schemes to tempt New Yorkers
to this part of the Sound shore to spend their Summers.”ŒìNot one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
    I will discase me, and myself present
    As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
    Thou shalt ere long be free.”Œ¬Now that he had been so often under fire, Charlie Pierrepont looked
back with surprise to the days when, in Frankenburg, he had hoped
that a French bullet might kill him!”Œ•Now that her beloved Heinrich was gone, the
links between her and Carl--the means of communication--were broken,
and she could hear of him no more.”ŒèNow the
great news that Eliphalet Duncan received in New York one fine spring
morning was that Baron Duncan and his only son had been yachting in the
Hebrides, and they had been caught in a black squall, and they were both
dead.”ŒÿNumerous statuettes under
glass shades, and pretty bijou articles, littered all the marble and
marqueterie tables, with Dresden china vases of flowers, gathered
fresh that morning by Ernestine and Herminia in the garden at the
foot of the castle rock.”Œ²Nyt sinÃ¤ olet
joutunut jo kolmannen kerran kuukauden kuluessa selkkauksiin jonkun
alkuasukkaan kanssa ja tÃ¤llÃ¤ kertaa on kysymyksessÃ¤ kosto, vielÃ¤pÃ¤
porroh-miehen kosto!”Œ¿NÃ¤iden kahden tapahtuman jÃ¤lkeen retkikunta osoittautui taipuvaiseksi
jÃ¤ttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n Pollockin yksiksensÃ¤ ja hÃ¤n taas tunsi ensi kerran elÃ¤mÃ¤ssÃ¤Ã¤n
tarvetta liittyÃ¤ mustien joukkoon.”ŒtNÃ¤mÃ¤ todeksihavaitsemiset ovat itse asiassa paljon
varmempia kuin todistukset useata murhasta hirtettyÃ¤ vastaan.”ŒNÃ¤ytti
siltÃ¤, kuin olisivat he kumpikin katselleet jotain sydÃ¤metÃ¶ntÃ¤
konnantyÃ¶tÃ¤, jota he eivÃ¤t enÃ¤Ã¤ voineet estÃ¤Ã¤ tapahtumasta.”Œ2O brave new world,
    That has such people in't!”ŒOO heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
    The king and queen there!”Œ`O thou mine heir
    Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
    Hath made his meal on thee?”ŒO, ho, monster!”Œ_O, if a virgin,
    And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
    The queen of Naples.”X@  O, rejoice
    Beyond a common joy, and set it down
    With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
    Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
    And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
    Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
    In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves
    When no man was his own.”Œ{Of course I watch over Sibyl.â€

â€œI hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to
talk to her.”Œ‘Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with
her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense
house in London.”ŒÙOf course, the more I kept my mind detached from
fancy, the more the temper fitted for observation would be obtained; and
I therefore riveted eye and thought on the strong daylight sense in the
page of my Macaulay.”Œ;Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd.”ŒQOh, Herminia, few like me
have to endure misery without the prospect of relief!'”ŒOh, I don't mean
in Art.”ŒOh, I donâ€™t mean
in Art.”ŒÇOikea kÃ¤si ei taivu heittoon,
aterioidessaan joutuu Gottfried pulaan veitsen ja kahvelin sekaantuessa
ja hÃ¤nen ajatuksensa tien suunnasta -- hÃ¤n on pyÃ¶rÃ¤ilijÃ¤ -- ovat aivan
epÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤iset.”ŒOld Mr. Poynter, of Acrington?”X-  Old Stratford, the whitewashed town between this place and Bridgeport,
made famous by mysterious "rappings" many years ago, and more recently
celebrated as the scene of poor Rose Clark Ambler's strange murder, is
much concerned over a house which the almost universal verdict
pronounces "haunted."”Œ;Oletteko koskaan saanut kokea
kovapaineisen veden suihkua?”ŒOlisi ollut erinomaista sekÃ¤ Plattnerille
ettÃ¤ hra Whibblen perheelle, jos siellÃ¤ ja silloin olisi pulveriin
sattunut sytytetty tulitikku.”Xë  On
the first opportunity when they were alone, Ernestine had a thousand
questions to ask Heinrich; but to the fate--the disappearance of
Pierrepont, he could not give the faintest clue, though to feed her
hopes, when he had none, he drew largely on his imagination; for he
knew that unless Charlie were dead, or most severely wounded indeed,
and quite helpless, which we have shown him to be, he would have put
himself in communication with the nearest Prussian military
authorities.”X  On a bright September morning, when the sun shone warm on
the terrible little procession that crossed the prison yard to the shed
where was erected the apparatus of death, justice was done, and Dr
Teesdale was satisfied that life was immediately extinct.”XI  On a little table of dark
perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,
his guardianâ€™s wife, a pretty professional invalid, who had spent the
preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside
it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the
edges soiled.”Œ£On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady
Narborough, pretending to listen to the dukeâ€™s description of the last
Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection.”XI  On an evening in summer before the late siege of Paris, three
ladies--one a matron of mature years, the other two both young and
handsome girls, a brunette and a blonde--were seated in one of the
lofty windows of a stately room on the first _Ã©tage_ of the Grand
Hotel Royal, which immediately overlooks the Rhine at Cologne.”Œ«On his
death his son, who had been born in Italy, and was far more Italian than
Irish, changed his name to Neilsini, by which name the family has been
known ever since.”ŒžOn lisÃ¤ttÃ¤vÃ¤, ettÃ¤ kuolemantapaus todellakin sattui Vincentkadulla
aivan koulupihan vieressÃ¤ ja mikÃ¤li on selvinnyt, juuri Plattnerin
palaushetkellÃ¤.”Œ®On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a
costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered
with five hundred and sixty pearls.”ŒÄOn the
second night the house ghost was seen by the officer; on the third night
it showed itself again; and the next morning the officer packed his
grip-sack and took the first train to Boston.”XÕ  On the banks of the Rhine, or before the walls of
Paris, if he ever reached it, a French bullet might end it all for
him, and he would never have the horror and sorrow of knowing that
she was the bride of another; and so on, and on, day by day, when by
her side, talking with her and enjoying all the sweet charms of her
society, did this honest fellow torment himself, for we may, in the
matters of love and jealousy, torment ourselves far more than others
can.”Œ‘On the corpse-encumbered Geisberg the glorious old valour of France
was conspicuous as ever; but her troops were badly officered and
badly led.”Œ¯On the first
of the paper sheets was a plan, carefully drawn and instantly
recognizable by a person who knew the ground, of the south aisle and
cloisters of St. Bertrand's.”X   On varmaa, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n
aikoi ne kirjoittaakin, mutta siitÃ¤ ei koskaan tullut mitÃ¤Ã¤n ja niinpÃ¤
ei meillÃ¤ ole muuta neuvoa kuin koota hÃ¤nen kertomuksensa hajanaiset
kappaleet kapteeni Simmonsin, Weybridgen, Steevensin, Lindleyn ja
muitten muistista.”X   Once outside
the hamlet you may walk in any direction (so long as you avoid the high
road which leads to Brockenhurst) for the length of a summer afternoon
without seeing sign of human habitation, or possibly even catching sight
of another human being.”ŒAOne
evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen.”ŒŒOne afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious
arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henryâ€™s house in Mayfair.”Œ¢One evening Baron Rhineberg came galloping to the Schloss, and from
his vast rotundity was ushered into the drawing-room when on the
verge of an apoplectic fit.”XS  One great cause, perhaps, of Charlie's popularity among the
Thuringians was, that as an Englishman he was destitute of that
aristocratic hauteur which causes the well-born German officer to
regard all under his command as an inferior order of beings, a style
of bearing and sentiment unknown alike in the armies of Britain and
France.”ŒŠOne little enclosure
from Carl, received secretly in the letters of Herminia, was worth
all the baths and wells in Germany to Ernestine.”ŒyOne now appeared with a rope, which he had procured somewhere, and a
cold perspiration burst over the brows of Heinrich.”ŒõOne of a thousand of such episodes, as were daily occurring along the
frontiers of Alsace and Lorraine, would no doubt have desolated for
ever the household of M. de CaillÃ© but for the timely arrival of
Pierrepont and his twenty Thuringians.”Œ_One of the last to stay in the room above
with Selde was, strange to say, Leb Narr, of Prague.”ŒcOne of the oldest and best-known Banshee stories is that related in the
_Memoirs_ of Lady Fanshaw.”ŒaOnly England could have produced him, and he always said that the
country was going to the dogs.”ŒWOnly it seems curious that
these marks should have remained so long in Vezinâ€™s case.”X  Only once, however, did the sympathizing Herminia think her pale
cousin was about to yield, when one night she laid her head on her
bosom, and said with a gasping shudder,

'Oh, how terrible it is to give one's hand to the living when one's
heart has been given to the dead!'”Œ¿(Onpa kerrassaan omituista
ajatella, ettÃ¤ muutamilla meikÃ¤lÃ¤isistÃ¤ saattaa olla serkkuja, jotka
syÃ¶vÃ¤t ihmisiÃ¤ Sherboro-saarella tai kÃ¤yvÃ¤t ryÃ¶stÃ¶retkillÃ¤ Sofas-heimon
mukana.)”ŒäOppilaat valmistelivat
iltalÃ¤ksyjÃ¤Ã¤n ja Plattnerilla oli ilo havaita, miten muutamat heistÃ¤
tekivÃ¤t Euklideestaan salaisia selvittelyjÃ¤, tietokokoelmia, joiden
olemassaolosta ei hÃ¤n tÃ¤hÃ¤n asti ollut mitÃ¤Ã¤n tiennyt.”ŒmOr--and once
again the terror resurged--had the invisible pushing thing been that
which I had seen outside?”X´  Outside, his house is just
like mine, and ten thousand other small houses in London, but on
entering, instead of finding a narrow passage with a door on one side,
leading into the dining-room, which again communicates with a small back
room called â€˜the study,â€™ he has had the sense to eliminate all
unnecessary walls, and consequently the whole ground floor of his house
is one room, with stairs leading up to the first floor.”X
  Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the
two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious
tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and
beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made
monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted
her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the
dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the
Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and
whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the
price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase
living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot
who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide
riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;
Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and
minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery,
and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson
silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might
serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy
could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion
for red blood, as other men have for red wineâ€”the son of the Fiend, as
was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling
with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the
name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads
was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of
Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the
enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave
poison to Ginevra dâ€™Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a
shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles
VI., who had so wildly adored his brotherâ€™s wife that a leper had
warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his
brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen
cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in
his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto
Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,
and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow
piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,
and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.”ŒfOver at the Thimble Islands, off Stony Creek, is an acre or two of soil
piled high on a lot of rocks.”Œ­Over near Middletown is a farmer named Edgar G. Stokes, a gentleman who
is said to have graduated with honor in a New England college more than
a quarter of a century ago.”ŒªOwing to her state of health, the Countess's favourite topic
and plan of the marriage was abandoned for the time, and in that
matter she obtained some temporary relief.”ŒXPaksut sÃ¤Ã¤ret pistÃ¤vÃ¤t esiin
villakoltun alta hÃ¤nen siinÃ¤ seistÃ¤ murjottaessaan.”Œ”Pari niistÃ¤ tosin tuli aivan hÃ¤nen
kasvoilleen ja seurasi ensimÃ¤isen esimerkkiÃ¤, mutta hÃ¤n hypÃ¤hti
syrjÃ¤Ã¤n, kuin olisi saanut suonenvedon.”Œ˜Perera oli muuan pienikasvuinen Portugalin juutalainen,
joka oli oleskellut Englannissa, ja englantilaisen ystÃ¤vÃ¤llisyys
miellytti hÃ¤ntÃ¤ suuresti.”Xt  Perfect in organization, the forces which the Prussian Government
were able to bring to the frontier a few days after the declaration
of war against France were divided into three great armies, making a
grand total of four hundred and twelve thousand infantry, and
forty-seven thousand eight hundred cavalry, with one thousand four
hundred and forty pieces of cannon.”ŒŽPian senjÃ¤lkeen kun niitten
kuilun pohjan tummasta rakennusryhmÃ¤stÃ¤ tuleva virta oli lakannut,
alkoi Plattner uudelleen kulkea alaspÃ¤in.”ŒÂPierre and Bertrand, the two sturdy little serving-men, who rushed in,
saw nothing, but felt themselves thrust aside by something that passed
out between them, and found Dennistoun in a swoon.”XÑ  Pierrepont could see nothing of what was being done at any other
point than where his regiment crossed; but in a few minutes he found
himself out of the water, and into clouds of smoke, through gaps in
which, when made by the morning breeze, he could see the dusky
columns of the enemy--the red-breeched Zouaves in their variegated
Oriental costume, their necks bare, and their bearded faces dark and
brown, and a corps of Voltigeurs in blue faced with white.”X   Pierrepont gladly quitted these dreadful orchards
of Bellecroix, and retired to a grassy bank by the side of the
highway to Metz, where a few of his brother officers, apart from the
rest, were sharing the contents of their havresacks and comparing
notes on the dire events of the day.”ŒVPinch him, will you?â€

I pinched Machmout; he did not pay the slightest attention.”ŒñPlants, too, were
receptive, so responsive to kindness; thought given to them was never
thought wasted, and to come back now after a monthâ€™s absence in London
was to be assured of fresh surprise and pleasure in each foot of
garden-bed.”ŒâPlattner kertoi minulle, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n palauksensa jÃ¤lkeen on unessa nÃ¤hnyt
ja tuntenut samoiksi erinÃ¤isiÃ¤ paikkoja toisesta maailmasta, mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤
johtunee siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ nÃ¤hdyt maisemat ovat jÃ¤Ã¤neet hÃ¤nen muistiinsa.”ŒPlattner voi nÃ¤hdÃ¤, ettÃ¤ se, mikÃ¤ vuoteessa
nÃ¤ytti valkoiselta, vÃ¤Ã¤ntelehti ja ettÃ¤ vaimo sÃ¤ikÃ¤hti katsoessaan
sinne yli olkansa.”ŒéPlattner, joka oli mielissÃ¤Ã¤n siitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ omasi
selvÃ¤sti elÃ¤hyttÃ¤vÃ¤n ja innostusta herÃ¤ttÃ¤vÃ¤n voiman ja samalla luotti
poikain tietÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¶myyteen, analyseerasi niitÃ¤, tekipÃ¤ yleisiÃ¤ huomioita
niitten kokoonpanosta.”Œ¯Plattnerin kerrottua tÃ¤mÃ¤n tarinan koetin minÃ¤
saada jotakin selvÃ¤Ã¤ tuosta toisesta maailmasta istumalla pitkÃ¤n ajan
erÃ¤Ã¤n valokuvaajan pimeÃ¤ssÃ¤ huoneessa yÃ¶llÃ¤.”Œ¸Pojat kertovat hÃ¤nen kompuroineen sisÃ¤Ã¤n mutisten niitÃ¤ miedonlaisia
kirouksia, joita hermostuneet koulumestarit totuttavat itsensÃ¤
kÃ¤yttelemÃ¤Ã¤n -- ettei pahempaa tapahtuisi.”Œ“Polder behaves as
though he had been placed under eternal obligation by Rickett, and
yearly sends the little Ricketts a box of presents and toys.”ŒLPorroh-mies kyyristyi oven suuhun ja
katsoi Pollockia kÃ¤sivartensa alatse.”ŒóPresently after, from former habits we may
suppose, the guest desires a cup of tea; but, bethinking herself of her
new character, escapes from her own proposal by recollecting that Mr.
Bargrave was in the habit of breaking his wife's china.”ŒðPrior to the affair at SaarbrÃ¼ck, twenty Baden troopers, led by a Mr.
Winslow, made a dash into France at Lauterburg, and galloping on as
far as Niederbronn, in open daylight, cut all the telegraph wires
along the line of railway there.”ŒîPuhuaksemme teknilliseen tapaan: Plattnerin oikean

  PROSPERO.”Œ¯SOME FAMOUS GHOSTS OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL

(Philadelphia _Press_, Oct. 2, 1898)

The Capitol at Washington is probably the most thoroughly haunted
building in the world.”Œ¯SOME REAL AMERICAN GHOSTS

THE GIANT GHOST

(Philadelphia _Press_, Sept. 13, 1896)


A case in point is the Benton, Indiana, ghost, which is attracting much
attention.”Xv  SaarbrÃ¼ck was retaken by the Prussians; the French were again
defeated at Forbach; vast bodies of prisoners taken in battle or by
capitulation began to pour through the towns of Germany, where they
were kindly received; the once great Empire of France seemed
tottering to its fall, and on the 13th of August the Prussian scouts
were at Pont-Ã -Mousson, on the Moselle.”ŒÑSaatuaan
pallon kannelle, ruuvasivat he lasin auki ja tirkistivÃ¤t pimeÃ¤Ã¤n
sisustaan (sÃ¤hkÃ¶valokammion tarkotus nÃ¤et oli valaista vettÃ¤ pallon
ympÃ¤rillÃ¤ ja se oli aivan erillÃ¤Ã¤n isosta kammiosta).”ŒPSaatuaan lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤rin osoitteen Pollock astui hetken kuluttua ulos
Cornhillille.”X   Safely in harbour
    Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
    Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
    From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
    The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
    Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
    I have left asleep: and for the rest o' the fleet
    Which I dispersed, they all have met again
    And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
    Bound sadly home for Naples,
    Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd,
    And his great person perish.”ŒGSaint Bertrand, who puttest devils to flight, pray for me most unhappy.”ŒVSandy had been engaged a year ago to a girl of
Gavon who was in service at Inverness.”ŒØScotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left
for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor
Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris
at all.”Œ<Se meni
ilman vaivaa huoneen seinÃ¤n lÃ¤pi tulisijan luona.”Œ£Se ponnahti lattialle jÃ¤ttÃ¤en korteille punaset jÃ¤ljet ja vieri
nurkkaan; sinne se pysÃ¤htyi kÃ¤Ã¤ntyneenÃ¤ ylÃ¶salasin, mutta tuijottaen
tiukasti Pollockiin.”XG  Seeâ€--and he brought it out of his pocket--â€œit is all
there in those English notes, five pounds each, and there are twenty of
them.â€

Our conclusion was slightly different, for even Weston will allow that
Achmet _hoped_ to learn from dead lips the secret of the treasure, and
then to kill the man anew and bury him.”ŒSeitsemÃ¤n -- kahdeksankymmenen jalan syvyydessÃ¤ ei ole liikettÃ¤
lainkaan ja sinne minÃ¤ pÃ¤Ã¤sen kahdessatoista sekunnissa.”ŒsSen kasvaessa tuo spektralinÃ¤ky _meidÃ¤n_
maailmastamme tuli joko suhteellisesti taikka todellisesti heikommaksi.”X+  Serious disasters followed the slight success won by the French at
SaarbrÃ¼ck, when the Crown Prince of Prussia, two days after, made a
furious attack on their right flank, which rested on a high hill
called the Geisberg, just within the frontier of France and a little
south-east of SaarbrÃ¼ck.”ŒbSeuraan sinua Sulymaan, jotta pÃ¤Ã¤set turvassa laivaan" -- "Se
on tarpeetonta", vastasi Pollock.”ŒÜShe came
to her end in the year 1798, for it was not this particular house she
lived in, but a much larger one that then stood upon the site it now
occupies, and was then, of course, not in London, but in the country.”ŒOShe had forgotten that
frightening man in Paris who said he had been a priest.”XC  She knew that it is understood and accepted in her native country
that unions cannot, as in England, be contracted on the impulse of
love or romantic notions, but upon principles of cold and practical
utility, as mere transactions between parents; but they are sometimes
equally so on this side of the Straits of Dover.”Œ]She laughed at
him, and there wasnâ€™t a girl in London at the time who wasnâ€™t after
him.”ŒÈShe lives with her mother, a faded
tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta
dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen
better days.â€

â€œI know that look.”ŒcShe pulled her furs closer round her;
after her years in India this London damp seemed very harsh.”ŒTShe was a Hitchcock, and the Hitchcocks had been settled
in Salem since the year 1.”ŒZShe was describing Hugh minutely, even
the little things like the burn on his right hand.”Œ£She was determined to pass her honeymoon in the little old
house at Salem, and she was equally determined not to go there as long
as there were any ghosts there.”Œ£She was dressed as if for a ball or some great festival; but Carl
remembered that this was Christmas-time, always a season of gaiety at
Frankenburg as elsewhere.”ŒDShe was maintained by an only
brother, and kept his house in Dover.”X  She was no longer _espiÃ¨gle_, as of old; the piano remained unopened
now, and no entreaties on the part of her father could lure her into
playing 'Die Wacht am Rhein,' the war-song of Arndt, or any of those
stirring and patriotic airs with which all Germany was resounding
now.”X6  She was thinking of Prince Charming,
and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,
but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about
the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life
he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers.”ŒSiellÃ¤ uiskenteli hai.”Œ‹Siihen vaikutti, paitsi
seinÃ¤mÃ¤n tavatonta jyrkkyyttÃ¤, se, ettÃ¤ pitkin kukkulan rinnettÃ¤ oli
irtonaisia vierinkiviÃ¤ suurin joukoin.”Œ=Silloin Elstead ainakin
katui, ettÃ¤ oli retkelle lÃ¤htenyt.”Œ_Silloin Pollock muisti, ettÃ¤ hÃ¤n oli ensi kerran tuntenut sitÃ¤ kahakan
jÃ¤lkeisenÃ¤ yÃ¶nÃ¤.”ŒƒSilloin hÃ¤net keskeytti pieni
Monrovian ja Bathurstin vÃ¤liÃ¤ kulkeva siipilaiva, joka saapui puhaltaen
rantariuttojen keskitse.”ŒËSilloin tÃ¤llÃ¶in toisetkin kasvot
kÃ¤Ã¤ntyivÃ¤t hÃ¤neen pÃ¤in; niitten silmÃ¤t muistuttivat kuolleita ihmisiÃ¤,
jotka olivat hÃ¤ntÃ¤ johtaneet, loukanneet tai auttaneet nuoruudessa ja
miehuusvuosina.”Xˆ  Singleton had originally
seen the advertisement of the house in a Sussex paper, with the
statement that there was good dry-fly fishing belonging to it, but it
was with but faint hopes of the reality of the dry-fly fishing that we
went down to look at the place, since we had before this so often
inspected depopulated ditches which were offered to the unwary under
high-sounding titles.”ŒhSinne pÃ¤in hÃ¤ntÃ¤
kuletettiin, aivan kuin ihmiset olisivat kulettaneet ilmapalloa maalta
kaupunkiin.”ŒsSinulle ollaan jo ennestÃ¤Ã¤nkin kyllin kiukkuisia
tuon epÃ¤jumalan tÃ¤hden, johon sinÃ¤ hÃ¶lmÃ¶ kirjoitit nimesi.”ŒÒSinÃ¤ et nÃ¤y kÃ¤sittÃ¤vÃ¤n, ettÃ¤ tÃ¤mÃ¤
porroh-silmÃ¤nkÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤jÃ¤ hallitsee tÃ¤tÃ¤ maata, hÃ¤nellÃ¤ on vallassaan sen
lait, uskonto, hallitus, lÃ¤Ã¤kintÃ¤taito... Sellaiset ne nimittÃ¤vÃ¤t
pÃ¤Ã¤miehetkin.”Œ£SinÃ¤ iltapÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ Pollock tappoi kaksi kÃ¤Ã¤rmettÃ¤, jotka hÃ¤n tapasi
riippumatossaan; myÃ¶skin punasia muurahaisia vilisi sillÃ¤ paikalla
entistÃ¤ enemmÃ¤n.”X2  Sir, I invite your highness and your train
    To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
    For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
    With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
    Go quick away; the story of my life
    And the particular accidents gone by
    Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
    I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
    Where I have hope to see the nuptial
    Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
    And thence retire me to my Milan, where
    Every third thought shall be my grave.”Œ˜Sitten alkoi risteilijÃ¤ liikkua, vesi myllertyi, hai katosi,
vaahtovirta ryÃ¶psÃ¤hti yli tuon kristallikirkkaan syvyyden, joka oli
niellyt Elsteadin.”Œ^Sitten hÃ¤n alkoi tarkastaa toisia
pÃ¤itÃ¤, jotka nyt tiheÃ¤ssÃ¤ parvessa nousivat rinnettÃ¤.”ŒaSitten hÃ¤n nÃ¤ki, hyvin hÃ¤mÃ¤rinÃ¤ ja kaukana,
useita fosforiloistoisia ihmismÃ¤isiÃ¤ olioita.”ŒhSitten hÃ¤n sai hiukan kuumetta, kÃ¤vi perin janoiseksi ja hÃ¤nen
vanha painajaisensa palasi uudelleen.”ŒáSitten seurasivat oleskelu majassa, kahakka
porroh-miehen kanssa, paluumatka jokea pitkin alas Sulymaan,
mendilÃ¤is-salamurhaaja punaisine liinoineen, hurjat yritykset tuhota
tuo pÃ¤Ã¤, hÃ¤nen mielikuvitelmansa kasvaminen.”Œ´Sitten toisena iltana Pollock
sai ikÃ¤vÃ¤n huomautuksen sitÃ¤, ettÃ¤ porroh-mies oli saapunut Sulymaan;
terÃ¤vÃ¤ksi hiottu rautapalanen viilsi hÃ¤nen olkapÃ¤Ã¤hÃ¤nsÃ¤ lihahaavan.”X]  So Abdul died and was buried, and we all went to the funeral feast at
which we ate more roast meat than one naturally cares about at five in
the afternoon on a June day, in consequence of which Weston and I, not
requiring dinner, stopped at home after our return from the ride into
the desert, and talked to Mohamed, Abdulâ€™s son, and Hussein, Abdulâ€™s
youngest grandson, a boy of about twenty, who is also our valet, cook
and housemaid, and they together woefully narrated of the money that had
been and was not, and told us scandalous tales about Achmet concerning
his weakness for cemeteries.”ŒUSo Heinrich was at Frankenburg, and not with the old 95th before the
walls of Paris!”ŒLSo are
you.â€

â€œThere is no such thing as Black Magic,â€ said Weston.”Œ·So at Frankenburg, as at many other places, where the hearts of the
people were with the flower of Germany, they could but wait and
pray--pray and be patient till true tidings came.”Œ½So he
told her all about it, and how whenever he went to Salem the two ghosts
interfered, and gave dark sÃ©ances and manifested and materialized and
made the place absolutely impossible.”Œ0So he made his plans
and he went down to Salem.”ŒóSo he scoot' past dat buryin'-ground
whut on de hill, an' dat cemuntary whut betwixt an' between, an' dat
grabeyard in de hollow, twell he come' to de pumpkin-patch, an' he
rotch' down an' tek' erhold ob de bestest pumpkin whut in de patch.”Œ¤So the Countess, perhaps, had her wicked wish fulfilled at last, and
fate had removed 'the intruder,' as she named him, for ever from the
path of Baron GrÃ¼nthal!”ŒÂSo the days of joy stole away at Frankenburg, till Charlie began to
reckon sadly the few that yet remained, when time would inexorably
separate him from Ernestine, and, too probably, for ever.”ŒóSo yiver'body 'low' dat so 'cep' Zack Badget, whut been tellin' de
ghost-tale, an' he ain' gwine say "Yis" an' he ain' gwine say "No,"
'ca'se he right sweet on de school-teacher; but he know right well he
done seen plinty ghostes in he day.”ŒžSo, like Heinrich, Charlie had fallen into the 'enemy's hands;' but
fortunately for him, they were the soft and gentle ones of little
CÃ©landine de CaillÃ©.”X  Society at Frankenburg was narrow and monotonous; most of the
visitors who came, especially Baron GrÃ¼nthal and the Justiz-rath,
spoke only of politics, of Bismarck's plans, and the coming war,
which did not interest the ladies, save in so far as the 95th
Thuringians were concerned.”Œ@Some day you will meet
himâ€”when you come back from Australia.”ŒÊSome day, when you are
tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your
philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate
enough to possess.â€

â€œI shall be charmed.”X  Some days after this she became almost speechless; yet she was quite
conscious, and looked so lovely with the dishevelled masses of her
dark hair floating over her laced pillow and delicate neck, as she
smiled tenderly on her mother, Herminia, and all who hovered about
her.”X–  Some food we had and some fresh water that
    A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
    Out of his charity, who being then appointed
    Master of this design, did give us, with
    Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
    Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
    Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
    From mine own library with volumes that
    I prize above my dukedom.”Œ¿Some large blue china jars and
parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small
leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a
summer day in London.”ŒŒSome of the others were frail, yearning, evaporated creatures, and
the ex-priest in Paris had something terrible and condemned in his look.”ŒðSome private
case in the interior of Hungary claimed his attention, and it was not
till later--the 15th of August, to be exact--that I had arranged to
meet him in Berlin and then return to London together for our harvest
of winter work.”X  Some time after, Mr. Veal's friends got him a place in the custom-house
at Dover, which occasioned Mrs. Veal, by little and little, to fall off
from her intimacy with Mrs. Bargrave, though there was never any such
thing as a quarrel; but an indifferency came on by degrees, till at last
Mrs. Bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half; though above a
twelvemonth of the time Mrs. Bargrave hath been absent from Dover, and
this last half year has been in Canterbury about two months of the time,
dwelling in a house of her own.”ŒÁSomething like fifty yards of broken ground, grey rock,
moss and lichen, lay between, and over all lay the curtain of the night
and the great whispering winds from the forests of Scandinavia.”ŒmSomething--a good deal--has been done by others, as I
mentioned; but I hope to go over the ground to-morrow.”ŒESpellbound, he stood and stared for a time that he could not measure.”Œ^Strasbourg was besieged,
Phalsburg bombarded, the Prussians were daily everywhere victorious.”ŒþStrong, yet tender, was thus the bond of sympathy between the
cousins; for those whom they loved--the one openly, the other
secretly--and to whom they were affianced, were facing side by side
the foes of Germany, and risking the same perils and toils.”ŒùSuch a consummation would have sounded
as ridiculous as if the statue of the commander in _Don Juan_ had not
only accepted of the invitation of the libertine to supper, but had also
committed a beefsteak to his flinty jaws and stomach of adamant.”ŒVSuch an offer was deemed flattering, even for a daughter of the house
of Frankenburg.”Œt(Such dreadful fellows 'those officers from the barracks' seem to be
all the world over, from Canterbury to Cabul!)”Œ´Such were the cries that rang along the line of march, when on the
1st of August the various columns of the German army began to meet
those which left Paris shouting 'To Berlin!'”ŒåSuddenly he observed near him, while lingering over his wine in the
speise-saal, which had emptied of guests, the Baron Rhineberg and, of
all men in the world, Baron GrÃ¼nthal, busy with their meerschaums and
tankards of beer.”Œ]Suddenly--in a moment--at absolutely the same instant--all spring
into the air and fly away.”ŒSulymassa
oli usko porroh-miesten pahansuopaisuuteen ja taikavoimaan saastuttanut
ilman, hÃ¤netkin oli vallannut uhkaava ja kammottava tunne.”Œ„Suuri osa
katseli vaan kÃ¤rsivÃ¤Ã¤, toiset sanomattomassa tuskassa olevaa vaimoa,
joka ahnain silmin etsi mitÃ¤Ã¤n lÃ¶ytÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤.”Œ~Syvyyden kello kilisi yhÃ¤ nopeammin,

PREFACE


These stories have been written in the hopes of giving some pleasant
qualms to their reader, so that, if by chance, anyone may be occupying
in their perusal a leisure half-hour before he goes to bed when the
night and the house are still, he may perhaps cast an occasional glance
into the corners and dark places of the room where he sits, to make sure
that nothing unusual lurks in the shadow.”Œ)*=THE BILL-TOPPERS.= By ANDRÃ‰ CASTAIGNE.”X  THE CONFESSION OF CHARLES LINKWORTH


Dr Teesdale had occasion to attend the condemned man once or twice
during the week before his execution, and found him, as is often the
case, when his last hope of life has vanished, quiet and perfectly
resigned to his fate, and not seeming to look forward with any dread to
the morning that each hour that passed brought nearer and nearer.”X  THE DEAD TRYST ***

THE DIARY OF MR. POYNTER


The sale-room of an old and famous firm of book auctioneers in London
is, of course, a great meeting-place for collectors, librarians,
dealers: not only when an auction is in progress, but perhaps even
more notably when books that are coming on for sale are upon view.”Œ×THE HOUSE WITH THE BRICK-KILN


The hamlet of Trevor Major lies very lonely and sequestered in a hollow
below the north side of the south downs that stretch westward from
Lewes, and run parallel with the coast.”XÃ  THE MAN WHO WENT TOO FAR


The little village of St Faithâ€™s nestles in a hollow of wooded hill up
on the north bank of the river Fawn in the county of Hampshire, huddling
close round its grey Norman church as if for spiritual protection
against the fays and fairies, the trolls and â€œlittle people,â€ who might
be supposed still to linger in the vast empty spaces of the New Forest,
and to come after dusk and do their doubtful businesses.”ŒíTHE OTHER BED


I had gone out to Switzerland just before Christmas, expecting, from
experience, a month of divinely renovating weather, of skating all day
in brilliant sun, and basking in the hot frost of that windless
atmosphere.”ŒbTHE SPOOK OF DIAMOND ISLAND

(St. Louis _Globe-Democrat_, Sept. 18, 1888)

HARDEN, Ill., Sept.”Xª  TO THE READER

The origin of the foregoing curious story seems to have been as
follows:--

An adventurous bookseller had ventured to print a considerable edition
of a work by the Reverend Charles Drelincourt, minister of the Calvinist
church in Paris, and translated by M. D'Assigny, under the title of "The
Christian's Defense against the Fear of Death, with several directions
how to prepare ourselves to die well."”ŒTRINCULO, a Jester.”ŒTTaivas varjelkoon minua edistÃ¤mÃ¤stÃ¤ taikauskoa koettamalla olla ylen
puolueeton!”Œ=Tapoin sen tÃ¤nÃ¤ aamuna lattialla lÃ¤hellÃ¤
riippumattoani.”Œ+Tavalliseen
matkalaukkuun mahtuisi kaikki.”ŒuTe
pitÃ¤isitte hÃ¤nen sydÃ¤ntÃ¤Ã¤n aivan tavallisena, mutta tottunut tarkastaja
huomaisi siinÃ¤ jotain harvinaista.”ŒThat evening he rejoined his aunt at their temporary abode, which was
a small dower-house not many hundred yards from the Manor.”Œ¸That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large
button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady
Narboroughâ€™s drawing-room by bowing servants.”Xþ  That night, at the very time the three gentlemen were in the
smoking-room busy with their china-bowled pipes, and with silver
tankards of beer before them--Heinrich full of happy dreams about his
fair-haired cousin and the trick they had played her; the old Count
full of memories of Waterloo and the coming war, French insolence,
the Vaterland, and all the rest of it; Charlie thinking how divinely
Ernestine sang and played, how sweet her downcast lashes looked, how
bright her upward glances, how lovely were the white hands that
wandered over the ivory keys, and made the said keys look very dark
and yellow by comparison, and while to him and Heinrich it seemed
that life at Frankenburg would be almost insupportable without the
two 'belles' thereof.”ŒÁThat same
evening I reached London.â€

â€œAnd how long altogether,â€ asked John Silence quietly, â€œdo you think
you stayed in the town of the adventure?â€

Vezin looked up sheepishly.”X+  Thatâ€™s the chief
thing.â€

â€œTell me more facts--just facts.â€

â€œIt began last summer when I came back from Ireland; he had been here
alone for six weeks, and I thought him looking tired and queer--ragged
and scattered about the face, if you know what I mean, and his manner
worn out.”ŒµThe
whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away
to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you
should have shown more consideration.”ŒãThe Baron had made a careful study of his costume, and
was most gracious to the ladies, but more especially to the Countess,
who addressed nearly all her conversation to him--the winner of one
of 'the Belles of Frankenburg.'”Xì  The Countess being always busy about the management of her household,
the Count having frequently to visit Aix about a lawsuit in one of
the courts there, and Heinrich being usually much with his _fiancÃ©e_,
threw Charlie and the young Grafine so much together that their
hearts were hopelessly entangled; yet no word of love escaped the
latter: he knew too well his lack of civil rank, and how many, or
rather how _few_, kreutzers he had per diem as a Prussian lieutenant
of infantry.”Xu  The Countess carefully folded her son's letter, and fixing her keen
grey eyes on Herminia, said, somewhat sententiously:

'Though an old man now, the father of my Heinrich was as brave a
soldier as ever trod the soil of Germany, and his name is yet
venerated among the Uhlans of the Archduke; and I am proud to say,
Herminia, that his son is worthy of such a father.'”ŒzThe Countess could detect in the face and deportment of her niece
that which the preoccupied or uninformed Count did not.”ŒíThe Countess's ideas of propriety would not permit
her to allow her girls to peruse any other light literature; but
having an idea that a married woman might read works of a
higher-flavoured nature, she sometimes read the works of MM.”X‹  The Countess, who, though a modern lady of fashion, requiring her
novels, cushions, Spitz lap-dog in a basket, and the _Kladderadatch_
to get through the day, was nevertheless, on the other hand, as
thrifty a German housewife as any of the old school, had bustled
about overseeing the culinary preparations, while her husband, Count
Ulrich, who was passionately addicted to the pleasures of the chase,
spent only half that day in the woods, and was now, with a huge pipe
(having a china bowl and tassel) in his mouth, watching, like a
sentinel, from a terrace before the drawing-room windows, the road
that wound away towards Aix-la-Chapelle.”Xï  The Duchess (she was down on the purser's list as
Mrs. Martin, but her friends and familiars called her the Duchess of
Washington Square) and Baby Van Rensselaer (she was quite old enough to
vote, had her sex been entitled to that duty, but as the younger of two
sisters she was still the baby of the family)--the Duchess and Baby Van
Rensselaer were discussing the pleasant English voice and the not
unpleasant English accent of a manly young lordling who was going to
America for sport.”X”  The French, aware of the vital importance of keeping possession of a
hill on their right, as soon as their troops began to fall back
before those battalions sent forward by General Steinmetz, threw up
some earthen works, in rear of which their 62nd regiment of the line
lay down, while several batteries of artillery fired over their
heads, raining grape and shell upon the fast-advancing Prussians.”ŒÉThe Grosvenor
is really the only place.â€

â€œI donâ€™t think I shall send it anywhere,â€ he answered, tossing his head
back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at
Oxford.”Œ†The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a
rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he
worshipped.”ŒÍThe Modern Library of the World's Best Books

Boni & Liveright, Inc.”Œ The actual castle is a ruined
and ivy-mantled tower of unknown, but fabulous, antiquity, as it is
actually averred to have been a hunting seat of Charlemagne.”ŒŠThe air seemed alive
with fire and falling bombs, while, at the same moment, the whole
town of Weissenburg, close by, burst into flames.”ŒÌThe battle of the day began on some wooded hills above the pretty
red-tiled village of Gorz, near a pleasant stream that meanders
between fields and beautiful coppices from Mars-la-Tour to the
Moselle.”X3  The beautiful passageâ€”

Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-nightâ€”


was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been
taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution.”Œ½The boy
was to be sent to Hungary, to one of the most celebrated teachers of the
times, in order to lay the foundation for his sacred studies under this
instructor's guidance and wisdom.”X  The carriage deposited Charlie Pierrepont at an hotel in
Aix-la-Chapelle, where he meant to remain for a little to make some
attempt to see Ernestine once more--to arrange, if possible, about
their future correspondence, and then to rejoin the Thuringians.”ŒeThe cathedral was ever
empty, the old church of St. Martin, at the other end of the town,
deserted.”ŒöThe company was liable for compensation, and his
motherâ€™s name on her linen, and a letter with the Sheffield address on
it, led to the arrival of a purely official and formal notice, stating
that the company were prepared to consider claims.”ŒÛThe composition of the
picture is well-nigh indecipherable, but there is a Latin legend below,
which runs thus:

          "Qualiter S. Bertrandus liberavit hominem quem
          diabolus diu volebat strangulare."”ŒÉThe dawn stole in over the city, and the Rhine began to glitter in
light--the dawn of that day on which the Baron GrÃ¼nthal was to return
to Frankenburg, and 'the final arrangements' were to be made.”X  The day had been
warm and muggy, but when I looked in on the way up to my room, it
seemed to me to have grown suddenly and bitterly cold, not with the
dampness of English frost, but with the clear and stinging exhilaration
of such days as we had recently spent in Switzerland.”XX  The digestion, however,
may become suddenly atrophied, delirium tremens may, without warning,
supervene, or he may go completely off his head....â€

       *       *       *       *       *

But the weeks passed on, the July suns made London reel in a haze of
heat, and yet Alingham remained busy, brilliant and altogether
exceptional.”ŒEThe dim roar of London
was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.”XA  The enthusiasm all over Germany was unquestionably great at this
time, and as a specimen of it, Heinrich told Charlie, exultingly, how
his father's old comrade and brother officer, Field Marshal the Count
Von Wrangel, then in the eighty-fourth year of his age, on seeing his
old regiment, the 3rd Cuirassiers, marching through Berlin, had
petitioned the king for leave to join them as a private, as he was
now too aged to lead; but the king declined the offer of the brave
old man, and requested him to remain in Berlin, and make himself
useful in a more peaceable way.”Œ6The excitement in the army and at Paris grew terrible.”X  The explanation which Weston gives us
of all these phenomena, is that a certain picture of people I know is
present in my mind, though I may not be aware of it,--present to my
subliminal self, I think, he says,--and that I give an unspoken
suggestion to the hypnotised Machmout.”Œ‰The family of Elihu Osborn lives in this house,
and ghosts have been clambering through it lately in a wonderfully
promiscuous fashion.”e(ŒœThe fiery spook, it is said, still makes its
nightly trips to Diamond Island, but no more investigating parties have
ventured across to solve the mystery.”ŒdThe figure waved her arms towards the house, and
my mother heard the bitter wailing of the Banshee.”Œ.The firing
first began at the village of Ste.”ŒYThe firm in Bermondsey which was third on his
list was accustomed to handling this line.”XP  The first conversation was, of course, about the
expected war concerning the Spanish succession, the political
sketches in the _Kladderadatch_, the official accounts in the _Staats
Anzeiger_; how all Paris was brimming over with enthusiasm, rage, and
vengeance; that crowds were always in the streets shouting, 'Down
with Prussia!'”ŒþThe former occupant who haunted you appears to have
been a woman of singularly atrocious life and character who finally
suffered death by hanging, after a series of crimes that appalled the
whole of England and only came to light by the merest chance.”ŒøThe furniture and hangings were all pale
blue silk, trimmed with white lace or silver; water-colours decorated
the wall, and, in a place of honour, hung a Berlin engraving
representing the meeting of Wellington and Blucher at La Belle
Alliance.”Xm  The garden-wall was uncommonly high, the gate securely locked; outlet
there was none; and in another minute Frankenburg found himself in
the hands of a score of these French volunteers, so many of whose
comrades had been--no doubt, barbarously--put to death by the
Prussians, simply for being found with arms in their hands, so that
to look for mercy was vain.”X  The general doctrine of hypnotism, suggestion, and
cure by such means had been accepted even in London by this time, and,
owing to a few papers I had written on the subject, together with my
foreign diplomas, I found that I was a busy man almost as soon as I had
arrived in town.”Œ¨The ghostly bride and bridegroom
went away at once on their bridal tour, and Lord and Lady Duncan went
down to the little old house at Salem to pass their honeymoon."”ŒThe glory of my France is gone!”Œ÷The hour was an unusual one for his
Excellency to be at Frankenburg, but he had been dining there the
evening before; a storm had come on, and, to the infinite annoyance
of Ernestine, he had accepted the Count's invitation to remain all
night.”X*  The house itself, with
its two battlemented towers of Elizabethan times, gleamed with many
windows, and we passed out of sight of it, and into the shadow of a
box-hedge, clipped into shapes and monstrous fantasies, and found chairs
by the striped tent at the top of the sheltered bowling-alley.”ŒThe inquest held in Switzerland showed that he cut his
throat with a razor, in an attack of delirium tremens induced by drink.”ŒLThe joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine
also.”ŒkThe last boot held, the spoon went busily to the
monsterâ€™s mouth, and we just flowed into Kingâ€™s Lynn.”ŒÄThe latter was certainly very eligible indeed with his
good looks, his title, and his million of money, and Lady
Madingley--ex-future Mrs Alingham--was perfectly content with what she
had done.”X8  The letter was from Vantin, the notary, to the young doctor, who thus
found himself suddenly rich, so all obstacles were removed to a union
with CÃ©landine, when she was a few years older, though the family of
Adolphe was of humble origin and that of De CaillÃ© ancient, and shone
at the court of Louis XIII.”ŒåThe line of the invading
forces was thus so greatly extended that the French generalissimo
dared not make any offensive movement against them, but was compelled
to retreat along the highways that led from Gravelotte to Verdun.”Xi  The meal was taken somewhat silently, for at times:

  'When great events were on the gale,
  And each hour brought a varying tale;'

and when newspaper correspondents were often fallacious and fallible,
the gazettes were unfolded with fear and trembling, and the arrival
of a telegram was quite sufficient to terrify the quiet household at
Frankenburg.”ŒšThe medium is an elderly woman living in Brooklyn, who never appears in
public, and the only persons present were members of her family and
known to me.”Œ¬The month of January was near its end when Lord Kildonan, in the
Embassy at Lisbon, received a letter that for once gravely disturbed
that vain man and neglectful father.”ŒsThe moon
is red with dust, and because it is low.â€

â€œStill sensitive to external conditions,â€ said Weston.”Œ¶The most
famous Banshee of ancient times was that attached to the kingly house of
O'Brien, Aibhill, who haunted the rock of Craglea above Killaloe, near
the old palace of Kincora.”ŒîThe mother and daughter swept out of the room, their dresses--the
rustling moirÃ© of the Countess and the maize-coloured silk of
Ernestine--gliding noiselessly over the varnished floor, and Herminia
was left to her own sad reflections.”Œ#The natives call it Frisbie Island.”ŒThe next morning was pellucid summer: a faint north wind blew, and a sun
worthy to illumine the isles of Greece flooded the sky.”X5  The night passed over quietly, and without alarm; but with dawn of
day came an officer of Uhlans, attended by a trumpeter, flying at
full speed along the line of advanced posts, calling in all the
out-pickets, while the King was probably already telegraphing to
Berlin as usual:--

'Another new victory!”Xö  The old butler, who had served as man and boy in the Frankenburg
family from shortly after the days of Waterloo and Ligny, who had
attended Marshal Blucher when on a visit, and had made the fortunes
and honour of the denizens of the Schloss his own, as hereditary
retainers of the Caleb Balderstone type occasionally do, even in this
age of iron, opened his grey eyes very wide, alike at the fierce
energy and the order of Charlie Pierrepont, but vanished at once to
rouse the grooms and comply.”Œ‹The old lady's eyes were actually filled with tears, and after a
pause she said:

'I regret, Herminia, that I ever sent you to England.'”X  The once smart officer of Uhlans, who had ridden on old Blucher's
staff at Waterloo, on that eventful day when the 'Iron Duke' wept
with joy to hear the boom of the Prussian cannon--the smart Lancer,
of whom the Countess had boasted at the Grand Hotel, was somewhat
obese now.”ŒrThe only silent one there was the radiant Herminia, who had been, as
her affianced said, 'so pleasantly tricked.'”Œ–The orphreys were
woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with
medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.”XE  The particular islands to which we had camping rights by virtue
of paying a nominal sum to a Stockholm merchant lay together in a
picturesque group far beyond the reach of the steamer, one being a mere
reef with a fringe of fairy-like birches, and two others, cliff-bound
monsters rising with wooded heads out of the sea.”ŒuThe point where we stood--a huddled, shivering group--faced the wider
channels that led to the open sea and Finland.”•      ŒxThe policeman on the
beat had heard it too, and it came from the hall of Louisâ€™ house, the
window of which was open.”ŒÑThe routed Hussars rallied
suddenly, wheeled about, and attacked their pursuers, and again
passed their fallen leader, and the old Graf--a young Graf, then--in
their pursuit of the French, whom they routed.”ŒÔThe ruin, too, was haunted by the spectre of a former Count of
Frankenburg, who, resolving to get rid of his Countess, to the end
that he might marry again, invited her to share a dish of love-apples
with him.”ŒÛThe self-conscious air that
a really beautiful girl usually possesses had nearly left her now;
while Herminia, happy in her love, and having but one anxiety--the
safety of Heinrich--looked bright and radiant as ever.”Xe  The senior of these--Adelaide, Countess of Frankenburg, a woman
grey-haired now, and with features somewhat of the heavy German
type--had just received a letter, and was intent upon it, while her
daughter Ernestine, and her orphan niece Herminia, watched her face
with interest, and forgot the little Tauchnitz editions over which
they had been idling.”Œ©The servants had gone straight up,
starting the same day as we, while we had got out at Perth, motored to
Inverness, and were now, on the second day, nearing our goal.”X`  The shop was home-shop, so to speak, for
it was almost entirely concerned with the manifold perfections of the
new six-cylinder Napier which my host in a moment of extravagance, which
he did not in the least regret, had just purchased; in which, too, he
proposed to take me over to lunch at a friendâ€™s house near Hunstanton on
the following day.”Œ|The show was a very smart new one; the names of the proprietors, I
need hardly tell you, were Italian, Foresta and Calpigi.”Œ2The shy London sunlight peeped through the blinds.”Œ—The sisters of
charity began to flit about like good angels, and the bells were rung
in Weissenberg to muster the firemen for the burial of the dead.”ŒWThe situation--with all his trust in Ernestine--was, to say the least
of it, alarming.”Œ‚The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,
was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses
from the Koran.”X6  The stories concerning
the movements of the alleged spook were, of course, not given any
credence at first, but later, when several reputable citizens of Hardin
announced that they had positively seen an uncanny looking object moving
about on the island at night, the rumors were more seriously considered.”ŒåThe sudden and blunt reference to the church at Burtscheid, the scene
of her last and farewell interview with Charlie, gave her so sudden a
shock--her sensibility had become so delicate now--that she had to
retire to her room.”ŒöThe sun was setting, and the shadows were darkening in the orchards
of Bellecroix, when the 95th were ordered to pile arms and take a
little rest; and a singular scene--singular by way of contrast, and
yet terrible--did these orchards present.”X  The telegram which, on that same evening, the Baron Rhineberg so duly
reported at Frankenburg, thereby piercing, as with a poniard, the
heart of Ernestine, was correct in some of its details, as the
_first_ man killed in the Franco-Prussian war was an Englishman--but
not Charlie.”Œ˜The third army came on by the way of Mannheim and Germesheim, and
formed to the left of the second, at the latter place, Speirs,
Neustadt, and Landau.”Œ¼The titular ghost had been sheltered by the
Duncan family for hundreds of years, and the domiciliary ghost had had
free lodging in the little old house at Salem for nearly two centuries.”Œ The tomb of Frank Sydall and of the Lord
Viscount Saul, only child and heir to William Earl of Kildonan, is
one: a stone altar tomb in Whitminster churchyard.”X0  The town was soon filled by Prussian
troops, but the hardy Thuringians pitched their tents near a village
on the bank of the river, on a pretty wooded slope; and there on the
first evening of the halt, Charlie received some intelligence from
Frankenburg, which caused him much perplexity and thought.”ŒˆThe troops were considerably broken as they fought their way up the
hill, and some of the King's Grenadiers got mingled among the 95th.”ŒOThe uncanny, the unhealthy--as in the master of such writing,
Poe--fascinates.”ŒâThe village is now chiefly
celebrated for its mineral waters; but 'the abbey of Burtscheid,'
says Forster, a writer at the close of the last century, 'is
beautifully situated, and finished with all ecclesiastical splendour.”Œ$The viscounty of Kildonan was Saul.'”ŒThe volume takes us
from the "Banshees and Other Death Warnings" of Ireland to a strange
example of Jewish mysticism in "The Silent Woman."”ŒüThe weather in India is often sultry, and since the tale of bricks is a
fixed quantity, and the only liberty allowed is permission to work
overtime and get no thanks, men occasionally break down and become as
mixed as the metaphors in this sentence.”ŒiThe wild justice of the pistol, as some one
has named it, was ceasing to be appreciated even in Germany.”XŠ  The wine card was called for next, and
the serious business of the meal began, amid all that noise and
hubbub peculiar to a German _table d'hÃ´te_, where Counts and Barons,
with ribbons and orders, may be seen handling their knives and forks
like English ploughmen, and pretty frauleins tugging away at chicken
bones with the whitest of teeth, and the most perfect air of
self-possession.”Œ¸Their father, Mr.
Harrison Ross-Lewin, was away in Dublin on law business, and in his
absence the young people went off to spend the evening with a friend who
lived some miles away.”X  Their voices
irritated him; and often he started to his feet with the intention of
vaguely proceeding to the vicinity of Frankenburg, and as frequently
relinquished the idea; for he dreaded lest he should meet the Baron,
and be tempted into the commission of some wild outrage.”XU  Then:

â€œI will go and inform the police,â€ he said, â€œif you will stop here, and
see that Achmet does not get out.â€

But this I altogether refused to do, and, after covering the body with
the coffin to protect it from the hawks, we secured Achmetâ€™s arms with
the rope he had already used that night, and took him off to Luxor.”ŒThen
how cruel it was of the Countess to view him so, and to treat him as
she did; and again and again she asked in her heart--

'Is it a crime to love?'”Œ<Then
she saw that Hugh was standing at the foot of the bed.”ŒEThen Louis
spoke again, and his voice was trembling with excitement.”ŒƒThen Mrs. Veal mentioned Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick, at the end of which he
gives an account of the lives of the primitive Christians.”X]  Then a
change came suddenly over her; the soft light died out of her eyes;
her cheeks became hollow, her lips pallid; her whole expression and
aspect painful and ghastly; the grasp of her hands became cold and
chilling, and her voice grew faint and husky, as she said,

'At Burtscheid, dearest Carl; meet me at Burtscheid, where last we
met.'”X  Then he
looks up and says, â€œKhalÃ¡s,â€ which means, â€œIt is finished.â€

We only engaged Machmoutâ€™s services as second general domestic a
fortnight ago, but the first evening he was with us he came upstairs
when he had finished his work, and said, â€œI will show you White Magic;
give me ink,â€ and proceeded to describe the front hall of our house in
London, saying that there were two horses at the door, and that a man
and woman soon came out, gave the horses each a piece of bread and
mounted.”Œ`Then it eddied, so to speak, and went across to Louis,
and his hair also moved, as I could see.”X‡  Then one or two young Counts, friends of Heinrich, were among the
frequent visitors, and Charlie gnawed his moustache viciously, as he
pictured to himself, perhaps meeting her years hence, as the wife of
one of these, when he was getting grey, weary of waiting for the
promotion that never came; or if it did, he would value so little
then: for with her, the glory of life would depart.”ŒdThen the silent, uncreaking machinery of justice, characteristic of
England, began to move forward.”Œ£Then there are
other storiesâ€”stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of
dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in
London.”ŒÒThen, for the first time, the house ghost spoke, in a low,
clear, gentle voice, and with a quaint, old-fashioned New England
accent, which contrasted sharply with the broad Scotch speech of the
family ghost.”Œ2Then, tell me,
    Who's the next heir of Naples?”ŒÜTheobaudin's
battalion, supported now by the 40th and 66th regiments, and some
mitrailleuses--those horrible weapons, now for the first time tried
in active warfare--made a furious attack on the village of St. Arnaul.”ŒLThere
was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.”X—  There
were others, again, grey, brown, and hardy men, who could digest
sutler's beef and eat such ammunition bread as the Kaiser's
commissariat supplied, sleep in their spike-helmets as soundly as in
a velvet night-cap, feel, by a bivouac fire, as comfortable as if in
the Grand Hotel at Cologne, and march to be maimed or massacred, to
wound and to slay, with genuine Teutonic taciturnity and phlegm.”ŒìThere he found young Frankenburg mounted on the horse of the
adjutant, who had fallen in the attack on Bellecroix, and whose duty
he had been ordered to take in the interim, an office that was nearly
costing him very dear soon after.”Œ´There is extant a tradition
to the effect that many years ago a party of Baltimore oystermen
encamped on the point, among whom was a man named Alley, who had
abandoned his wife.”ŒŠThere is no doubt that Calhoun County has a mystery which neither time,
bullets, courage nor philosophy can either drive away or explain.”Xý  There lay the familiar outlines of the houses,
sheeted with silver; there stood the trees in the little central square
with the fountain and small green lawns; there loomed the shape of
the church next to the Gasthof der BrÃ¼dergemeinde; and just beyond,
dimly rising into the sky, he saw with a sudden thrill the mass of
the huge school building, blocked castle-like with deep shadows in
the moonlight, standing square and formidable to face him after the
silences of more than a quarter of a century.”ŒbThere was lots of space between the mule and the veranda; and, if you
think I can't ride--There!"”ŒThere was no one at the chateau could tell him where the 95th were,
whether in front of Metz, besieging Strasbourg, or fighting at
Phalsburg.”ŒÛThere was none; so he resolved to make the best of it, and turned to
the doorway just as the portly old Count of Frankenburg, the Baron
GrÃ¼nthal, limping as usual with gout, and Heinrich entered the church
together.”Œ¨There was now a pause, after which the Countess said:

'The Count urges our return before Heinrich arrives; so we shall take
the train to Aix-la-Chapelle to-morrow.'”X—  Thereafter the fantastic
entered, for on opening it I found inside the ace of diamonds, and
scribbled across it in his well-known handwriting, â€œI am sending you
this for safe custody, as you know it is running an unreasonable risk to
keep aces in Italy.â€ The next evening I was just preparing to go
upstairs to dress when I heard the postmanâ€™s knock, and did precisely as
I had done in my dream.”X-  These I put
one evening into Machmoutâ€™s hand, when he was exhibiting to us his
curious powers of â€œthought transference.â€ The effect was that he
screamed aloud, crying out that the Black Magic had come, and though I
did not feel certain about that, I thought they would be safer in
mid-Nile.”XW  These and many other details of atrocities, which
actually found their way into the London papers, he read for the
edification of the ladies, while Ernestine and Herminia exchanged
glances of horror and commiseration, as much as to say how awful it
was to think that those they loved so dearly had to run the risk of
perils such as these!”ŒûThese rifle-pits and other defences extended over a considerable
space of ground, from Colombey, with its fields of scarlet poppies,
to Ars-sur-Moselle (so famous for its red wines), including
Laguenxey, Grigy, and Borny, all pretty little hamlets.”ŒèThese she had already, and
the Baron of GrÃ¼nthal is lower in rank than a Grafine of the family
of Frankenburg,' he added so proudly, that there was much in his tone
and bearing which reminded Charlie of the Countess, his mother.”X¦  These two ideas filled her whole soul as she sat, silent and
motionless, looking out on the view that lay before the hotel
windows: the broad waters of the famous Rhine, shining redly in the
light of the setting sun, covered with sailing vessels and steamers
shooting to and fro, its great pontoon bridge, through which the
current surged, the wilderness of roofs that formed the city--that
Rome of the north which Petrarch apostrophized to Colonna--stretching
far away, with the great masses of the unfinished cathedral, the dome
of St. Gereon, with its three galleries, and the stately tower of St.
Cunibert rising high in the air and casting mighty shadows eastward.”Œ)These were small-paned, with leaden bars.”ŒKThey
had specially written to engage the celebrated "Leb Narr," of Prague.”ŒéThey did so; but on entering the drawing-room
found the Countess asleep as usual, with the Spitz pug in her lap;
Herminia idling over the piano, while longing for Heinrich; and that
Ernestine was--which was never her wont--absent.”Œ¥They drank coffee and smoked, for though
Hussein was our servant, we had been that day the guests of his father,
and shortly after they had gone, up came Machmout.”Œ$They get all their dresses in Paris.”XR  They had ridden to Stolberg, after losing Heinrich and Herminia
together in the wood (rather a common occurrence, by the way, when
these four went out on excursions), and had taken shelter from a
storm of rain in a village church, where a marriage ceremony had been
performed before them, and they now recurred to this little episode.”X»  They had visited the tomb of Charlemagne, where, as Ernestine, while
leaning on Charlie's arm, and looking up in his face, from under one
of the prettiest of hats, told him with bated breath, that when it
was opened in the tenth century, the Emperor was not found in the
usual fashion of the dead, reclining in his coffin, but seated on a
throne as if alive, clothed in imperial robes, a sceptre in his hand,
and the gospels on his knee.”ŒYThey live in the country near Benton, and were driving home
one night from a neighbor's.”Œ¯They must be contemporary, he decided, with the
unprincipled Canon Alberic, who had doubtless plundered the Chapter
library of St. Bertrand to form this priceless scrapbook.”X  They were passed by him in a chaos or confusion
of thought, in dreams of Ernestine, of the day in the Hoch Munster,
and the evening in the church at Burtscheid, of battle-fields, with
lines of red kepis, fierce bearded faces, and hedges of bristling
bayonets looming through the smoke, of the roaring shriek of those
dreadful mitrailleuses--the veritable invention of Satan; yea, even
the scowl and curse of the French captain were not forgotten; but
after a time Charlie's thoughts became coherent; he knew fully where
he was; that a conical rifle bullet had been cut out of his back,
near the spine, by the skilful hands of Adolphe Guerrand; that he had
a narrow escape from death; that he was recovering, and had, as
nurses, CÃ©landine de CaillÃ© and her kind old _bonne_.”ŒÛThey were talking at slow intervals of some recent sorrow they had
sustained; but so great was the slaughter of the French war, that
everyone in Germany then was wearing crape or mourning for the loss
of some friend.”Œ1Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.”Œ9Think of his old father and his three sisters in England.”X6  Third Impression

PREFACE


Two of these stories, the third and fourth, have appeared in print in
the _Cambridge Review_, and I wish to thank the proprietor for
permitting me to republish them here.”X"  This King of Naples, being an enemy
    To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
    Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
    Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
    Should presently extirpate me and mine
    Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan
    With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
    A treacherous army levied, one midnight
    Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
    The gates of Milan; and, i' the dead of darkness,
    The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
    Me and thy crying self.”ŒThis _dÃ©nouement_, occurring
immediately after the proposal of the Baron, was too much for the
patience or equanimity of the irate Countess.”Œ§This flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to go to
Australia, and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with the

such as the invisible grimalkin that even now trips people up on the
stairs of the old mansion which President Madison and his wife, Dolly,
occupied, at the corner of Eighteenth Street and New York Avenue, after
the White House was burned by the British.”X¸  This landscape has

happy and composed than he had been since last he saw her.”ŒJThis must be the
tenth seer she had consulted since Hugh had been killed.”Œ¿This one small but rather
salient fact is necessary to record here, that as we waited at Kingâ€™s
Lynn, and as we buzzed homewards afterwards, no thought of Bircham
entered my head at all.”ŒOThis strange story found its way into the _Aix Gazette_ and the
_Extra Blatt_.”ŒšThis time to-morrow will find

myself, I hope to turn the flank of this Herr Mansfeld.”Œ&This was a frequent gesture of Hugh's.”ŒÓThis was satisfactory to her on one hand, while on the other she had
the pleasure of sharing her secret sorrows and hopes of future joy
with Herminia, with whom she had now a double link and bond of
sympathy.”ŒaThis was what had to be told to Lord Kildonan, and this really ends
the first part of the story.”ŒThou liest; thou canst not.”ŒThou liest, malignant thing!”ŒGThou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a

seeker after truth might, no doubt, have regretted that the laws of time
and space did not permit him to visit Bircham after the sinister dark
had fallen, and test whether for him there was visible or audible truth
in the tales of the village gossips, I was conscious of no such regret.”Xw  Though the French obtained possession of SaarbrÃ¼ck--the last troops
out of which were the Thuringians--the Prussians still continued to
lurk in the village of St. Johann, on the further side of the Saar,
and in the thick woods beyond it, from whence the white smoke spirted
out in incessant puffs as their well-concealed skirmishers kept up a
galling fire on the enemy.”XK  Though the son of a fox-hunting Warwickshire squire, who knew every
cover in Stoneleigh, the Brailes, and the Edgehills, the head of an
old but certainly embarrassed family, so far as mortgages and so
forth went, he was barely deemed among the wohlgeborn, according to
the Prussian standard; and poor Charlie had nothing as yet but his
epaulettes and sword, his pay as a soldier of Fortune, with the
privileges usually accorded to Continental officers, such as going
everywhere at half-price in virtue of their being in
uniform--privileges which ours would decline 'with thanks.'”X0  Though wearing the well-known uniform of the Prussian army, it was
impossible not to recognize in the new arrival, as he sprang lightly
up the steps of the hotel, that he was an Englishman, a genuine
Briton, for he was the Carl Pierrepont mentioned by young Frankenburg
in his letter to the Countess.”Œ¾Three years ago it was my fortune--my great misfortune--to sail from
Gravesend to Bombay, on return from long leave, with one Agnes
Keith-Wessington, wife of an officer on the Bombay side.”ŒbThy case, dear friend,
    Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
    I'll come by Naples.”X`  Times there were when he thought he would ask CÃ©landine to
write to her, but in turn was afraid to do so--to Herminia, or to
Ernestine, over whose postal correspondence, doubtless, the Countess
kept a strict vigil--or, if she did write, there was no other post
than the field one between France and Prussia now, and that was with
the German army.”ŒtTo
Pierrepont, it seemed as if all the brightness had gone out of his
life; or, as if half that life had left him.”Œ	To Paris!”X©  To follow the 96th in detail through all the subsequent operations
would be foreign to our story; suffice it that after the attack by
the Crown Prince on the 6th of August, and the outflanking of Marshal
MacMahon, after the desperate battle at Worth, Charlie Pierrepont and
young Frankenburg found themselves still without a wound, hurrying in
pursuit of the fugitive French, who were in full retreat towards
Strasburg.”XV  To my servant there came the sight of a woman
outside the drawing-room door, where Jack was, hesitating about her
entrance, at the moment when Daisyâ€™s soul hovered between the two
worlds; to me there came--I do not think it is fanciful to suppose
this--the keen exhilarating cold of Davos; to Philip there came the
fumes of chloroform.”ŒŠTo this day nobody knows whether the ghost

their attention was suddenly attracted at the Spooks' Hollow by a white
and airy object which arose in its peculiar form so as to be plainly
visible and then maneuvered in every imaginable manner, finally taking a
zigzag wayward journey through the low dismal-looking surroundings,
disappearing suddenly into the mysterious region from whence it came.”Œ8Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page.”Œ0Two months ago I was the happiest man in

before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those
middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,
but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an
overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always
trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to
her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against
her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and
Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostessâ€™s daughter, a dowdy
dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once
seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,
white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the

the evening.”X¯  When these dreadful events were soothed by time, though not forgotten
at Frankenburg, and when the summer flowers were blooming over
Charlie's grave--a grave which he found under the guns of Mont
Valerien--the young Graf Heinrich was married to his cousin Herminia
by the Herr Pastor Von PuffenvÃ¶rtz, in the church of Burtscheid,
when, as if no sorrow had preceded the ceremony, all indeed went
merrily as a 'marriage bell.'”ŒûWhenever he was present
or expected, the Countess always seemed, somehow, unusually large and
rustling, and on this morning was especially so, in white lace over
back moirÃ©, with her high _toupÃ©e_--it was quite an evening costume
she had donned.”ŒÔWhere the huge velarium that Nero had
stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on
which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot
drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?”ŒÈWhereupon willful Kitty set off, her dainty little head in the air, at a
hand-gallop in the direction of the Band-stand; fully expecting, as she
herself afterwards told me, that I should follow her.”XÐ  Which do you back, Mr Druce, or the Duke of
Portland, or the Times Book Club?â€

That day, therefore, passed very busily for me; and there were enough
events moving in front of that black background, which I was conscious
was there all the time, to enable me to keep my eyes away from it, and I
was detained rather late at the office, and had to drive back to
Chelsea, in order to be in time to dress for dinner, instead of walking
back as I had intended.”ŒîWhile a mocking shout burst from the band, and many brutal and
irreligious speeches were made, some crying piteously, 'Bon voyage,
Monsieur le Comte--bon voyage, mon Prussien,' the noose closed and
tightened round the neck of Heinrich.”Xa  While my Waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale, and
Kitty was laughing and chattering at my side--while all Simla, that is
to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped round
the Reading-room and Peliti's veranda--I was aware that some one,
apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian name.”ŒâWhile this was being done we strolled about the room, looking at
prints, with applause for a Bartolozzi that Louis had bought in the New
Cut, and dead silence over a â€˜Perditaâ€™ which he had acquired at
considerable cost.”X  Whom do you suspect it is--I
mean, of course, who was the person you were thinking of when your
thoughts were transferred to Machmout.â€

â€œWhat Machmout said,â€ I answered, â€œsuggested Achmet to me.â€

Weston indulged in a laugh of scientific incredulity, and we set off.”ŒbWhy is it that so many gentlemen
in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs?”ŒdWhy is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves
the room of a club when you enter it?”Œ(Why should he trouble about Sibyl

the windows of the Grand Hotel, on the evening our story opens, she
looked dreamily down on Cologne, on city, church, and river, did
Charlie, from a balcony of his hotel, opposite the new theatre, look
down upon the strasse that leads to Borcette, and the crowded
boulevard that now occupies the place of a levelled ditch and
rampart, and is prettily laid out with pine trees, and many tiny
sheets of water.”ŒÁWith my nerves still
unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,
suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge road--anything
rather than the Jakko round.”ŒjWith this comment upon the tale Mr. Pinckney boarded a passing caboose
and was soon on his way to Tacoma.”Œ©Within a few months after, it was found out
that his wife had consumption, and, without any loss of time, she was
sent off to Davos, with her sister to look after her.”XV  Worby proceeded to explain that during the
alterations, services were held in the nave, the members of the choir
being thereby disappointed of an anticipated holiday, and the organist
in particular incurring the suspicion of having wilfully damaged the
mechanism of the temporary organ that was hired at considerable
expense from London.”Œ[Would it
come to pass that he might never return, but find a grave in the soil
of France?”ŒFWould it be

    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
    Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
    Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
    Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up

â€œKilled herself!”ŒöYet there was one thing he could not help remarking--that of all the
many handsome presents he had sent Ernestine, from Berlin and
elsewhere, not one was ever to be seen on her slender wrists, her
fairy-like hand, or round her delicate throat.”X×  Yet, oddly enough, though one would have thought that these benign and
cheerful influences of wholesome air and spaciousness of forest were
very healthful comrades for a man, in so far as nature can really
influence this wonderful human genus which has in these centuries
learned to defy her most violent storms in its well-established houses,
to bridle her torrents and make them light its streets, to tunnel her

difficult to ripen as a fruit-bearing determination to get up, and in
spite of our long day, I was glad when Hugh (the rest of the men having
yawned themselves out of the smoking-room) came back from the hospitable

that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of
him, and that he had even in his Eton days, â€œI believe that if one man

shouldnâ€™t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in
Paris in the autumn.”X*  â€œEgypt,â€ he whispered, â€œEgypt!â€


II

Nothing happened to disturb me in the night--nothing, that is, except a
nightmare in which Colonel Wragge chased me amid thin streaks of fire,
and his sister always prevented my escape by suddenly rising up out of
the ground in her chair--dead.”ŒJâ€œExactly a month afterwards I was in London again, but only for the day.”Œ…â€œHappier--and safer,â€ she said gravely, the canoe giving a dangerous
lurch as she leaned forward in her seat to catch my answer.”ŒHâ€œHappy!â€ she echoed, â€œI am only happy, Sibyl, when I
see you act.”Œâ€œI am Dr
Teesdale.”Œ â€œI am Dr Teesdale,â€ he said.”Œiâ€œI believe he married Lady Radleyâ€™s
maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.”ŒÝâ€œI believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely
scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern
butterfly.â€

â€œWell, I hope he wonâ€™t stick pins into you, Duchess,â€ laughed Dorian.”ŒLâ€œI donâ€™t care for myself,â€ he exclaimed,
â€œbut donâ€™t let Sibyl....”ŒVâ€œI donâ€™t desire to change anything in England
except the weather,â€ he answered.”ŒRâ€œI have finished my Hungary business,â€ he wrote, â€œand
am here for ten days.”ŒŽâ€œI left her in the forest of Arden; I shall
find her in an orchard in Verona.â€

Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner.”Œfâ€œI promised to go to a club in Whitechapel
with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.”Œ™â€œI see a blackness like the blackness of Egypt before my face,â€ said
the tones of this unknown voice that seemed half his own and half
anotherâ€™s.”Œ´â€œI suppose you have heard the news, Basil?â€ said Lord Henry that
evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol
where dinner had been laid for three.”Œ•â€œI took last year for the first time a small forest up in Sutherland,
called Glen Callan, very remote and wild, but affording excellent
stalking.”Œ5â€œI want you
to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.”Œîâ€œIf Bruder Meyer has not put his Amati to bed, I will accompany him,â€
said the musician suggestively, looking across at a man whom Harris had
not yet noticed, and who, he now saw, was the very image of a former
master of that name.”ŒJâ€œIn London I found that I was a whole week out in my reckoning of
time.”Œ…â€œNone of the chaps
will speak to me now.â€

â€œI thought you had left England.â€

â€œDarlington is not going to do anything.”Œ°â€œOf course I go and
stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old
woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake
them up.”ŒÇâ€œOh, I go to bed about three usually,â€ he said; â€œI suppose I sleep for
about four hours.â€

â€œAnd live on whisky, and eat like a Strasburg goose, and are prepared to
run a race to-morrow.”Œ=â€œOh, darling, Flo isnâ€™t so silly as to mind,â€ she said.”X   â€œOur mystery has nothing to do with these dead symbols,â€ he said,
â€œbut with something perhaps even more ancient, and of another country
altogether.â€

â€œEgypt?â€ I said half under my breath, hopelessly puzzled, but recalling
his words in my bedroom.”Xx  â€œPrecisely what I expected,â€ the doctor said calmly; â€œa fire-elemental
sent upon its mission in the days of Thebes, centuries before Christ,
and to-night, for the first time all these thousands of years, released
from the spell that originally bound it.â€

We stared at him in amazement, Colonel Wragge opening his lips for
words that refused to shape themselves.”Œ›â€œTeesdale,â€ he said, â€œis it to tell me this--I donâ€™t want to be
rude--but this bogey-tale that you have brought me here his evening?â€

â€œYes.”ŒVâ€œThat was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?â€

â€œYes; it was at dear Lohengrin.”ŒOâ€œThe folk at Achnaleish are
the dourest and the most savage in all Scotland.”X”  â€œThe influence in this house, induced by my experiment, has killed in
a flash, in a sudden stroke, the sources of my humour, and, though I
still go on writing funny tales--I have a certain name, you know--my
inspiration has dried up, and much of what I write I have to burn--yes,
doctor, to burn, before any one sees it.â€

â€œAs utterly alien to your own mind and personality?â€

â€œUtterly!”Œ.â€œThey go to America,â€ murmured Lord Henry.”X  â€œWait,â€ I whispered to Weston, â€œhe will use the Black Magic.â€

Again the wind dropped for a moment, and again, in the silence that came
with it, I heard the chiding of the hawk overhead, this time nearer, and
thought I heard more birds than one.”Œiâ€œWatch over Sibyl, Mother,â€ he cried, â€œwatch
over her.â€

â€œMy son, you distress me very much.”X  â€œWell, we went up to London as usual for the season, and though nothing
whatever occurred to remind me in any way of that single moment on
Christmas Eve, the reminding was seen to all right, the moment itself
took care of that, for instead of fading as is the way of sleeping or
waking dreams, it grew every day more vivid, and ate, so to speak, like
some corrosive acid into my mind, etching itself there.”Œ´â€œWhat do they say of us?â€

â€œThat Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.â€

â€œIs that yours, Harry?â€

â€œI give it to you.â€

â€œI could not use it.”Œâ€œYes; I am Doctor
Teesdale.”ŒSâ€œYes, it is KhalÃ¡s.â€

â€œDid I tell you of the sitt in England?â€ he asked.”Œ:â€œYou must certainly send it next year to the
Grosvenor.”ŒQâ€œYou went to the opera while Sibyl
Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging?”XD  â€œYour brother, no doubt, was as much tormented as you have been,â€
he continued after a pause in which Colonel Wragge seemed deeply
preoccupied with his thoughts, â€œand tried to find peace by burying it
in the wood, and surrounding the wood then, like a large magic circle,
with the enchantments of the old formulÃ¦.”Œzâ€œâ€˜Achnaleish,â€™â€ she declaimed, â€œâ€˜is situated in one of the grandest and
most remote parts of Sutherlandshire.”]”Œ Sirocco”a]”ŒCamp”a]”(Œ

I went up  to bed feeling very sleepy but below my drowsiness, so to speak, there  was the consciousness, stronger than before, that there was something  wrong in the house, that something dangerous was close at hand.”ŒÔ                                But in Camp, where every one realises how important the individual  contribution is to the comfort and wellbeing of all, the mind speedily  recovers tone and pulls itself together.”Œ„                                Printed in Great Britain by  UNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED, THE GRESHAM PRESS, WOKING AND LONDON          ”Œa                                Six months later I met Mrs Stanley in a country house in England.”ŒU                                The book is in the Wentworth Collection at Cambridge.”XL                                  The sequel can be made short indeed, some of my readers have perhaps  already guessed what it was, if they remember that inexplicable affair  of the churchyard at West Fawley, some eight years ago, where an attempt  was made three times to bury the body of a certain woman who had  committed suicide.”Œ~                                â€œAfter I returned from Paris, where I had studied under Charcot, I set  up practice at home.”XM          The gloomy halflighted chamber in which this scene took place, and  where the dead girl lay, looking so sweetly placid in her coffin, was  one of those, where, in conformity with the police regulations of  Germany in general, the bodies of persons deceased are placed within  twelve hours after deaththere to await interment.”ŒÓ    That the Banshee is not confined within the geographical limits of  Ireland, but that she can follow the fortunes of a family abroad, and  there foretell their death, is clearly shown by the following story.”Œi  The Duke of Milan      And his more braver daughter could control thee,      If now 'twere fit to do't.”Œ½ In any case, his mind was made up that book must return to  Cambridge with him, even if he had to draw the whole of his balance from  the bank and stay at St. Bertrand till the money came.”Œš"After that I took service here and there, not for long at a time,  and saw no more of him till I came to be Dr. Quinn's man at Dodds Hall  in Islington."”hÕŒZ"But you said it used to haunt the little old house at Salem, so I  supposed it had moved.”ŒJ"Did the ghost leave Scotland for America as soon as the old baron  died?"”ŒŒ"En rakasta riitaa, Pollock, sen tiedÃ¤t, mutta onhan  vietÃ¤vÃ¤n harmillista nÃ¤hdÃ¤ aiheidensa menevÃ¤n myttyyn tuollaisen asian  tÃ¤hden.”Œ_"En saa olla

was said to be haunted by  a headless apparition?”Œu"He talked the wraith of the Duncans and the  specter of the little old house at Salem into a matrimonial engagement.”X]  "His chambers being afterwards stripp'd, Mr. Casbury came by       part of the hangings of it, which 'twas said this Charlett       had design'd expressly for a memoriall of his Hair, giving       the Fellow that drew it a lock to work by, and the piece       which I have fasten'd in here was parcel of the same, which       Mr. Casbury gave to me.”hÝŒ‹"I mean," said Leb, in a most sympathetic manner, approaching still  nearer to Selde, "that maybe you had to make your daughter marry him."”ŒZ"I say, Pansay, what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on  the Elysium road?"”hàŒÜ"In those days," she began, feeling from the quality of our silence that  we were with her, "in those days I was interested in psychic things, and  had arranged to sit up alone in a haunted house in the middle of London.”ŒÙ"Jos pÃ¤Ã¤ni olisi murskautunut sormieni sijasta, niin kenties siitÃ¤  olisi pÃ¤Ã¤ssyt kokonaan", virkkoi Pollock, tuijottaen miettivÃ¤isenÃ¤  erÃ¤Ã¤seen tummaan pielukseen, joka oli ruvennut nÃ¤yttÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n pÃ¤Ã¤ltÃ¤.”Œe"Kunpa  olisin osannut tuota roistoa johonkin hengenvaaralliseen paikkaan", hÃ¤n  sanoi kiukkuisesti.”Œ"LÃ¤hden  kernaasti."”håhæŒ "Minulla  on tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ sÃ¤rkyÃ¤.”Œn"My

coatsofarms exhibiting the usual German  infinity of quarterings and certain officials of AixlaChapelle,  with their wives, who, like other wives all over Germany, insisted  upon taking the titles of their husbands' occupation, had been day  after day leaving their cards, having heard that 'the Belles of  Frankenburg had returned' but now all were to be denied, and this  afternoon was to be devoted to the only son of the house.”X…  Amid the pure satisfaction arising from the knowledge that Ernestine  loved him, and the natural anxiety to discover how she was ever to be  his wife, there was fated to come to Charlie Pierrepont the fear of  greater opposition to hisas yetsecret hopes and wishes, in the  person of a formidable rival, who, in a few weeks after the visit to  the Dom Kirche, came suddenly into the field.”X¾  Among the visitors was Baron GrÃ¼nthal, the Oberdirector of the  Consistory Court at Aix, a stout and florid, but rather handsome man,  in the prime of life, with an illtrimmed moustache hiding his whole  mouth, and the inevitable red ribbon at his buttonhole, who  mentioned incidentally that he had seen the Grafine and Herr  Pierrepont leaving the Dom

than one bottle of Rhenish wine, grasped each other's hands ever  and anon, and shouted, in the melodious language of the Vaterland,    'Hoch, Heinrich!”Œ%An' de owl mourn' out, "Whutwhooooo!"”ŒÓAn'

restlessness of his agony, or desire to procure water, he  had crawled away into some obscure corner to die.”Xa  And on most evenings I shall have so much  to tell you I canâ€™t â€œdrop inâ€ across

that she didn't want to bridal tour at all she just wanted  to go down to the little old house at Salem to spend her honeymoon in  peace and quiet, with nothing to do and nobody to bother them.”Xi  And so when Charlie Pierrepont left his kind friends and that  charming part of Lorraine, he little knew that he left behind a warm  girlish heart that yearned for him, and him only, and thought nothing  of Monsieur Adolphe, with all his thousands of francs, her father's  choice and keenly she envied herthe unknown ladywhose miniature  was in Charlie's heart.”ŒrAnd so when I got this offer from Paris, I  determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.”X  And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite  specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting  the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with goldthread palmates and  stitched over with iridescent beetlesâ€™ wings the Dacca gauzes, that  from their transparency are

95th  Thuringians in the rear, as it defiled across the bridge that led to  the suburb of St. Johann, each battalion with its carts of reserve  ammunition, drawn by six horses.”X  And still further to achieve the laudable end of subduing him, she  was now at her piano, practising sundry vapid fashionable songs which  she had learned in England, just as our English girls strum German  and Italian, learned, perhaps, at second hand from some poor needy  governess.”Œ¼And then he thought of his three sisters at home, and what his  emotions would be if such a scene, as he had just interrupted, had  taken place in his father's quiet house in Warwickshire.”Xñ  And there, at Christmas time, a tall firtree from the Reichswald  covered with toys and cakes, grotesque masks, papiermachÃ© dolls,  candles and shining lights, gladdened the hearts of the little  tenantry, who were cuddled and kissed up and down by the hearty old  Baron acting Father Christmas, with a mighty white beard, a cowl, and  long wand while Ernestine and Herminia glided about like good  fairies, dispensing viands and wine to the sturdy Teutons and their  blooming fraus, when the trees of the Reichswald were leafless and  bare, and the branches glittered like silver and crystal in the  frostwork, and the first snowdrops of the season were peeping up in  sheltered spots, and the brown stacks of the last harvest were  mantled with snow.”X  And this bravehearted and handsome young EnglishmanCarl, her own  Carlhe was risking wounds and death, enduring toil and suffering  for the

Rhineberg, 'a beerbloated Teuton' of the first class, came  occasionally to talk politics with the Count, over a pipe and flask  of Rhine wine the two daughters of the Justizrath, and a few other  visitors, dropped in, but Ernestine found it weary work to talk  commonplaces with these people, not one of whom had any vital or  particular interest, beyond a national one, in the army now in the

is strictly forbidden in the  army, have spent many an hour at the New Redoute, or Gaming House,  in the ComphausbadStrasse, where games of hazard, rougeetnoir,  roulette, and so forth, are played from morning till midnight.”X”  But he changed his mind, and carefully placed it in his  breastpocket as a souvenir for Ernestine of the battles before  Metz, and hurried to join the shattered

the assailants, sweeping  whole ranks away.”Œ7But he described to her  the little old house at Salem.”Œ\But he had never said anything about the ghost which haunted  the little old house at Salem.”XW  But he had not  presented himself nor did I hear more of him for three days, when I  received a letter from him, dated from Liverpool to this effect              "HONORED SIR,I humbly entreat your

impression was momentary, for that first breakfast in Camp  permitted no divided attentions, and I dare swear that the porridge,  the tea, the Swedish â€œflatbread,â€ and the fried fish flavoured with  points of frizzled bacon, were better than any meal eaten elsewhere  that day in the whole world.”ŒhBut there is no literary public in  England for anything except newspapers, primers, and

centuries and wrapped in the perfumed linen that the priests of Egypt  had prayed over with their mighty enchantments thousands of years  beforesomething in the sight of it lying there and breathing

sleeping beauty, only wakes  when these things cease, when the hotel has grown empty and the  billiardmarker â€œhas gone for a long restâ€ to Cairo, when the decimated  quail and the decimating tourist have fled northwards, and the Theban  plain, DanÃ¦ to a tropical sun, is a gridiron across which no man would  willingly make a journey by day, not even if Queen Hatasoo herself  should

pious resignation, was that not one of  these English pounds, not even their less satisfactory equivalent in  notes, which, out of the tourist season, are looked upon at Luxor as a  not very

  Eastwards the sky was paler and luminous, for the moon was  imminently rising, and even as I looked the red rim of the enormous disc  cut the line of the desert, and on the instant with a curious aptness,  one of the Arabs outside the cafÃ© broke out into that wonderful chant        â€œI cannot sleep for longing for thee, O full moon       Far is thy throne over Mecca, slip down, O beloved, to me.â€    Immediately afterwards I heard the piping monotone of Machmoutâ€™s voice  begin, and in a moment or two I went inside.”Œ_EikÃ¤ tuo esine ollut enÃ¤Ã¤ vain silmiin kuvastuva  kappale, se mongerteli ja puheli hÃ¤nelle.”X$  Eleven was struck by the great old clock in the hall of the Schloss,  and Charlie, who had been awaiting it, watch in hand, took his wax  taper, and softly and swiftly descended the great staircase to the  boudoir of the Countess, a small octagonal apartment that opened off  the drawingroom.”ŒŽEliphalet  was very learned in spirit loreperhaps because he owned the haunted  house at Salem, perhaps because he was a Scotchman by descent.”X  Eliphalet Duncan used to spend most of  his summer vacations at Salem, and the ghost never bothered him at all,  for he was the master of the housemuch to his disgust, too, because  he wanted to see for himself the mysterious tenant at will of his  property.”X  Eliphalet Duncan went to the White  Mountains, and in the car of the railroad that runs to the top of Mount  Washington he met a classmate whom he had not seen for years, and this  classmate introduced Duncan to his sister, and this sister was a  remarkably pretty girl, and Duncan fell in love with her at first sight,  and by the time he got to the top of Mount Washington he was so deep in  love that he began to consider his own unworthiness, and to wonder  whether she might ever be induced to care for him a littleever so  little."”Œ@England is bad  enough I know, and English society is all wrong.”ŒMEngland would do nothing of the  kind, said Charliewhat was the Rhine to her?”ŒQEngland would take part in the war, through  the influence of the Crown Princess.”Œ1Ennen pitkÃ¤Ã¤ epÃ¤ilys valtasi  hÃ¤net kokonaan.”ŒAEnnenkuin kÃ¶ysi pÃ¤Ã¤si juoksemaan, oli pallo kierinyt  ympÃ¤ri.”j.  ŒªErnestine sat for a time toying with a velvet slipper half on and  half off her pretty foot, and then suddenly she said    'Oh, Herminia, how can such a man care for me?'”Xb  Ernestine should be his wife at all  risks, even if he carried her off to England and, in the ardour of  his imagination, he began to marvel whether his father's old place in  Warwickshire would ever be free from those debts which drove him to  become a wanderer, a soldier of fortune, and to feed himself by his  sword in the ranks of the Prussian army.”ŒÃErÃ¤Ã¤n omnibussin aisa oli osunut hÃ¤neen ja yksi hevosista oli  kavioillaan murskannut kolme sormea hÃ¤nen vasemmasta kÃ¤destÃ¤Ã¤n  ja  juuri ne sormet, jotka hÃ¤n ampui porrohmieheltÃ¤ poikki.”Œ×ErÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤nÃ¤ hÃ¤nen serkkunsa Arnold   hÃ¤nen lÃ¤hin sukulaisensa  saapui tervehtimÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤ntÃ¤ ja houkuttelemaan  hÃ¤ntÃ¤ ulos  ja tarkastelemaan hÃ¤nen kuoppaisia kellertÃ¤viÃ¤ kasvojaan  uteliain silmin.”Œ›Etenkin hÃ¤n tutki  noita viittÃ¤ silminnÃ¤kijÃ¤Ã¤, pani toimeen niin ankaran ristikuulustelun,  ettÃ¤ he alkoivat epÃ¤illÃ¤ aistiensa selviÃ¤ todistuksia.”Œ€Etujaloissaan, jotka olivat vielÃ¤  pahempia ihmiskÃ¤den irvikuvia kuin sammakon, oli sillÃ¤ kuparilla  koristettu luinen sauva.”XÐ  Even the Countess forgot her Spitz pug, and a piece of mysterious  crochet, that seemed endless as the web of Penelope, while listening  to the news, and far away from her peaceful home her thoughts  followed her son, to where in the fields, the lanes, the valleys, and  pretty hamlets of Alsace and Lorraine, and in places then rendered  deserts, there lay in hundredsyea, in thousandsthe hopes of  families, the heads of homes, the source of many a broken heart!”ŒREven those that are born in England become foreigners after  a time, donâ€™t they?”ŒðEven those who had  heard the most evil things against himand from time to time strange  rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the  chatter of the clubscould not believe anything to his dishonour when  they saw him.”ŒiEvening Hymn.

STEVENS.”ŒâFor in Egypt, while to despoil  the bodies of ancient kings and priests is a privilege for which  advanced and learned societies vie with each other, to rob the corpses  of your contemporaries, is considered the deed of a dog.”Xê  For myselfI was one of the  tenantsI would far prefer living in a workhouse to inhabiting those  lowpitched oakpanelled rooms, and I would sooner look from my garret  windows on to the squalor and grime of Whitechapel than from the  diamondshaped and leaded panes of the Manor of Trevor Major on to the  boskage of its cool thickets, and the glimmering of its clear  chalkstreams where the quick trout glance among the waving waterweeds  and over the chalk and gravel of its sliding rapids.”XS  For the purpose of  putting this in, he was going down to a small cottage of his near  Godalming, where he had built in the garden a sort of outdoor studio, an  erection betwixt a room and a mere shelter, with the side to the north  entirely open, and flanked by this green trellis which was now one  immense constellation of purple stars.”ŒRFor what ages ago, their vile policy won      Of Strasburg, of Metz, and Lorraine.”Xò  For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost  immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a  subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the  London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the  Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be  something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on  the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of  a cane.”Œ€Four years ago there died in Washington an old gentleman who had been  employed for thirtyfive years in the Library of Congress.”Œ‡Francis Assheton and Louis Fielder were up at Cambridge together, and  there formed the friendship that lasted nearly till their death.”Œ½Frank and he saw each other  across the bushes and gardenbeds, and each quickening his step, they  met suddenly face to face round an angle of the garden walk, in the  fragrance of syringa.”ŒŠFrank busied himself for a little after the other had gone, moving the  table back under the awning of the veranda and quenching the lamp.”ŒºFrank was able to teach him  various games he had not known in Ireland, and he was apt at learning  them apt, too, at his books, though he had had little or no regular  teaching at home.”ŒhFrankenburg is situated on the summit of a tall rock that towers  above the line of the Antwerp railway.”XÍ  From the corner of the divan of Persian saddlebags on which he was  lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry  Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honeysweet and honeycoloured  blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to  bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs and now and then  the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long  tussoresilk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,  producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of  those pallid, jadefaced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of  an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of  swiftness and motion.”X˜  From the suddenness and efficiency of these arrangements, it was  clear 'that Count Bismarck and his master had been long and actively  preparing for war, and had not been entirely absorbed in peaceful and  innocent designs, as we were constantly assured by certain writers in  this country, who desired to present France to the world as a crafty  and ravening wolf, and Prussia a meek and inoffensive lamb.'”ŒÅFrom the surgeon of a Prussian regiment at SaarbrÃ¼ck, Charlie  Pierrepont got a medical certificate, to the effect that he was  incapable of rejoining the Thuringians, or of serving for some time.”ŒºFrom there you can telephone to  Stockholm and get a telegram sent without delay.â€    I sent him down to get the boat ready, and seized the opportunity  myself to run and wake Maloney.”X’  GAVONâ€™S EVE      It is only the largest kind of ordnance map that records the existence  of the village of Gavon, in the shire of Sutherland, and it is perhaps  surprising that any map on whatever scale should mark so small and  huddled a group of huts, set on a bare, bleak headland between moor and  sea, and, so one would have thought, of no import at all to any who did  not happen to live there.”ŒÃGHOSTS IN CONNECTICUT    N.Y. Sun, Sept. 1, 1885    "There is as much superstition in NewEngland today as there was in  those old times when they slashed Quakers and built bonfires for  witches."”Œ÷General Montmarie, and many other brave officers, fell at the head of  their men and, on this day, was inaugurated that series of rapid  disasters to France that never ended till the Prussian drums woke the  echoes of the Arc de Triomphe at Paris.”ŒiGet you to bed.â€    Machmout trotted obediently out of the room, and Weston closed the door  after him.”XÕ  Had Mrs. Veal's visit to her friend happened in our time, the conductors  of the daily press would have given the word, and seven gentlemen unto  the said press belonging, would, with an obedient start, have made off  for Kingston, for Canterbury, for Dover,for Kamchatka if  necessary,to pose the Justice, crossexamine Mrs. Bargrave, confront  the sober and understanding kinswoman, and dig Mrs. Veal up from her  grave, rather than not get to the bottom of the story.”ŒŽHalfdrunken voices could be heard still intermingled with a last,  hearty laugh over a joke of the fool from Prague echoing across the  table.”jY  ŒXHe  would not, for worlds, have cost that warm, wilful, and impassioned  heart one pang!”Œ#He could be made  a Titan or a toy.”X‚  He drank wine whenever he could get it, he ate food during the  days of Ramadan, scornful of the fact, when his appetite desired it, he  was supposed to have the evil eye, and in his last moments he was  attended by the notorious Achmet, who is well known here to be practised  in Black Magic, and has been suspected of the much meaner crime of  robbing the bodies of those lately dead.”ŒzHe enjoys, perhaps, the most notable bit of  superstition to be found anywhere in this country, in or out of  Connecticut.”ŒsHe explained quietly that he did not belong  here, but was making a tour of the parishes of WÃ¼rttemberg and Baden.”ŒÜHe feared to  write to Herminia, lest his handwriting might be recognised by the  Countess, and to write to Ernestine would too probably be useless, as  her correspondence was too probably under her mother's supervision.”Xe  He had been kept uninformed, so far as Herminia knew, of her aversion  to his son, and her very decided preference for a certain obscure  Herr Mansfeld, whose image was rising painfully before her, as she,  too, from time to time, looked down on the distant view, to where the  spires of the Dom Kirche of Aix rose darkly up amid the ruddy haze of  evening.”Œ‚He had but one desire and cravingto get  as far away from Frankenburg as possible, though it was the cage that  held his lovebird!”ŒQHe had just turned round to say something when  the door opened and Sibyl ran in.”ŒžHe had telephoned to me that very  morning, and even through the disguise of the miles of wire the thrill  of incalculable adventure had sounded in his voice.”X´  He had the  mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not  allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been  subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the  Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human  bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green  jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular  sweetness.”ŒŒHe had then the courage to inhabit the house  himself for a month, and a quieter, betterconditioned house could not  be found in all London.”Œ’He had told her about the Duncan Banshee, and the idea of having  an ancestral ghost in personal attendance on her husband tickled her  immensely.”Œ|He has been summering in Connecticut, and he avers  that his talk about native superstition is founded on close observation.”ŒÆHe has, of course, the right to speak  authoritatively, and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack in  Pansay's head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and  pressed him to death.”ŒÃHe is a wonderful hale and hearty  old fellow for his great age but he married late in life, and has  only had a silver wedding, when his comrade, old FieldMarshal  Wrangel, has had a golden one.”Œ„He kept his hands in the  pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the  gesture with which he had been greeted.”Œ±He knew she would be frightened out of  her wits if the house ghost revealed itself to her, and he saw at once  that it would be impossible to go to Salem on their wedding trip.”ŒVHe knew that his letter would be delivered by the post at Frankenburg  in the morning.”ŒWHe maintains that overwork slew Pansay who died under  his hands about three years ago.”ŒHe marched  along, picking his way delicately, but with a stately dignity that  suggested his ancestry with the majesty of Egypt.”X  He paid some attention to the  management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself  for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of  having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of  burning wood on his own hearth.”Œ¬He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of  extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise de la  vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.”X  He procured from Paris no less than  nine largepaper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in  different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the  changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have  almost entirely lost control.”X  He read  of the swallows that fly in and out of the little cafÃ© at Smyrna  where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned  merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each  other he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps  tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by  the hot, lotuscovered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rosered  ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small  beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud he began to brood  over those verses which, drawing music from kissstained marble, tell  of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the  â€œmonstre charmantâ€ that couches in the porphyryroom of the Louvre.”ŒEHe saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian  convolvulus.”Xâ  He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not  its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their  true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one  mystical, and in ambergris that stirred oneâ€™s passions, and in violets  that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the  brain, and in champak that stained the imagination and seeking often  to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several  influences of sweetsmelling roots and scented, pollenladen flowers  of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods of spikenard, that  sickens of hovenia, that makes men mad and of aloes, that are said to  be able to expel melancholy from the soul.”ŒvHe soon found himself  regularly installed and adopted, an ami du maison, with this  delightful family at Frankenburg.”ŒMHe thanked Heaven that there was this impending war with France  before them.”X
  He thought once more of the still, religious atmosphere that hung  over the little forest community like a veil, barring the distressful  world of the picturesque ceremonies at Easter, Christmas, and New  Year of the numerous feastdays and charming little festivals.”ŒHe thought only of  Sibyl.”ŒÐHe threw open the breech of the weapon to insert another cartridge  but ere he could close it, Pierrepont, quick as thought, snatched a  needlegun from the nearest soldier, took steady aim at him, and  fired.”XZ  He took a friend down with hima young  fellow who had been in the regular army since the day Fort Sumter was  fired on, and who thought that after four years of the little  unpleasantness down South, including six months in Libby, and after ten  years of fighting the bad Indians on the plains, he wasn't likely to be  much frightened by a ghost.”ŒØHe varied his  methods of attack for some of his victims he lay in wait, and to see  his horrible faceit was yellowish white, I may remarkpeering round  the wings made me think of the Vampyre in Fuseli's foul sketch.”Œ¨He was  closely shaven, all save a thick moustache, and he had tender brown  eyestender, at least, when they looked into those of Herminia, who  was now weeping freely.”Œ‘He was  conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his motherâ€™s nature,  and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibylâ€™s happiness.”X/  He was  rather too liberal to him in the matter of trinkgeld drink money  thus the britzka was driven at a thundering rate down that basin of  beautiful hills which surround Aix, while Heinrich waved his  foragecap, and sung verses from the warsong of Arndt      'My own Fatherland, my brave Germany on!”Œ÷He was a Cambridge man, who had come specially from  Toulouse to see St. Bertrand's Church, and had left two friends, who  were less keen archÃ¦ologists than himself, in their hotel at Toulouse,  under promise to join him on the following morning.”ŒUHe was a New Yorker, but  he said he'd sooner go to Boston than see that ghost again.”ŒfHe was a prime favourite with the Countess from his general  bonhommie of manner and with Ernestineah!”Xm  He was conscious enough of the tombs and cypresses, the pillars and  obelisks, standing grimly up from the snowclad graves of the dusky  outlines of various distant buildings of red lights streaming from  windows out upon the gloom and he could see the pale silver crescent  of the new moon peeping sharply up above the black outline of the  Schloss of Frankenburg.”ŒHe was examining  a large dark picture that hangs behind the altar, one of a series  illustrating the miracles of St. Bertrand.”ŒeHe was now within a very short distance of Frankenburg but how was  he to communicate with Ernestine?”Œ—He was on the way home when it happened, crossing northern France from  some mountain trip or other where he buried himself solitarywise  every summer.”ŒÕHe was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the  great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the  mauvedraped mantelshelf, exclaimed â€œHow horrid of Henry Wotton to be  so late!”Œ»He was selfish enough to have looked with stern,  black, and utter discouragement on any swain who had no high rank  then how much more with anger on a penniless soldier of Fortunea  sub.”ŒtHe was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a  polite goodbye to the captain, and go off at once to the goldfields.”XB  He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth  and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was  said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the  smokingroom of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another  gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.”ŒÛHe was, in fact, a very stout, baldheaded, and rather  coarsely featured old Teuton, with a red ribbon of course at his  buttonhole, and a thick plain hoop on his marital finger, as all  married men wear one in Germany.”ŒÆHe, on a certain spring day not many years since, was in London for a  few days upon business connected principally with the furnishing of  the house which he had just finished building at Rendcomb.”Œ_HeidÃ¤n keskustelunsa esine oli suuri terÃ¤spallo, jonka halkasija oli  ehkÃ¤ yhdeksÃ¤n jalkaa.”X(  HeidÃ¤n mielestÃ¤Ã¤n on aivan mahdollista, ettÃ¤ syvÃ¤n meren  pohjalla elÃ¤Ã¤ jÃ¤rkeviÃ¤, vettÃ¤ hengittÃ¤viÃ¤ luurankoisia elÃ¤imiÃ¤, jotka  ovat tottuneet alhaiseen lÃ¤mpÃ¶mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤Ã¤n ja kovaan paineeseen ja ovat niin  raskasrakenteisia, etteivÃ¤t elÃ¤vinÃ¤ eivÃ¤tkÃ¤ kuolleina nouse pinnalle.”Œ²Heinrich began again    'Herminia says that Ernestine has never closed an eye since last  night, which I am sorry to say, because if troubles can be slept upon  they are curable.”X(  Heinrich had fairly won his lovely cousinunder 'false colours,'  certainly but, nevertheless, he had won her perhaps, from the  girl's peculiar temperament and pride, he might never have done so  otherwise but having so won her, he was compelled to be thankful,  for with this odious French war on the tapisa war which, but for  his love, he would have hailed with genuine German ardour, and the  95th under 'orders of readiness' for the Rhinemarriage, as Herminia  herself had said, was not to be thought of so they had but to trust  to time and wait.”j  Œ€Her husband always called her the Boâ€™sunâ€™s Mate in Camp,  because it was her duty, among others, to pipe all hands to meals.”Œ°Her lover had confidently  promised to see her again, and to follow her to Frankenburg but she  had seen nothing of him, and no letter or note, however brief, had  reached her.”ŒWHer mother, Selde, still sat on the same chair on which  she had sunk down an hour ago.”ŒHHer name was Victoria,  and she had a perfect mania for going to church.”X  Her tears began to flow again, and she said    'It is in vain that the Graf storms, and that mamma tells me every  vow that has passed between us must be forgotten, that when you left  Frankenburg you lost all claim on me, and I was, and am, perfectly  free.”ŒŸHere she was at home  in London she became some one concealed by clothes, an artificial doll  overdressed and moving by clockwork, only a portion of her alive.”Xj  Here you looked  up the gap in the firtrees into a crimson sunset here the garden, trim  and carefully tended, dozed beneath some languid summer noon here an  angry wreath of stormcloud brooded over the meadow where the  troutstream ran grey and leaden below a threatening sky, while another,  the most careful and arresting of all, was a study of the brickkiln.”X«  Herminia bathed her face and hands with eaudecologne and water,  gave a finishing touch to her hair, kissed the envelope which  contained the now dry and faded leaves of Ludwig's rose, placed it in  her soft white bosom as a charm to strengthen her for the purpose she  had in hand, and descended noiselessly to the drawingroom, when the  sound of several voices, laughing loudly, jarred sorely on her ears  and excited nerves.”Œ½Herminia grew deadly pale, and took advantage of the Countess  hurrying out upon the

that his  sister's wishes should be consulted while Ernestinewhose toilette  a goldencoloured silk, trimmed with black lace, a most becoming  one for a brunette, had been made under the critical eye of her  motherlooked pale, 'worried,' and worn, and, like Heinrich,  provoked too, for, as we have said elsewhere, she was a selfwilled  little beauty, and somewhat opinionated.”j›  Œ¨Herminia shook her head mournfully, and said, 'I pray to Heaven that  it may be so, and with the hope these words inspire, I must now,  dear, dear Ludwig, sayfarewell!'”Xu  Herminia was dazzlingly fair, of a pure Saxon type, with  hair of that lovely brown tint which seems shot with gold in the  sunshine, and soft eyes of violetblue, that seemed almost black at  night, and though brown her tresses, and wondrously fair her skin,  her eyelashes and eyebrows were dark, almost black but her pretty  little nose bordered rather on the retroussÃ©.”XU  Herminia was right the girl, indeed, a close observer, was seldom  wrong in her deductions, for 'Herr Carl Pierrepont' was hopelessly  smitten at last by Ernestine, who, like the lively blonde, her  cousin, was rich in those charms, and mere than all, those pretty  mannerisms, or tricks of women, that win and secure a man's love for  ever.”ŒáHerr Lieutenant Pierrepont fell, it is  believed, mortally wounded'    The Baron paused and changed colour

His brigade was among the first troops actively  employed, with orders to occupy the line of the Saar, resting its  right on SaarbrÃ¼ck, with advanced posts at that place and in the  schloss of the

that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.”XM  His father left him with enough  money to give him a start, and a strong feeling of pride in his Scotch  birth you see there was a title in the family in Scotland, and although  Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger son, yet he always  remembered, and always bade his only son to remember, that his ancestry  was noble.”Œ_His father was a Scotchman, who had come over and settled  in Boston, and married a Salem girl.”Œ’His mother left him her full share of Yankee grit, and a  little house in Salem which has

  It drew  attention to the following paragraph    INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.An inquest was held this morning at the Bell  Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of  Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,  Holborn.”Œ‰It had been  taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed  had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.”X  It happened that just a week before the Prussians crossed the Rhine,  Adolphe Guerrand had been at Blankenberg with a patient, to whom he  had prescribed seabathing, and, when walking on the beach there, had  found a carefully sealed bottle among some seaweed.”Œ}It has brought you into touch with a somewhat  singular class of Invisible, but of one, I think, chiefly human in  character.”Œ†It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty  placeotherwise I wouldnâ€™t bother you about it.â€    â€œNo trouble, sir.”ŒVIt is an odd thing, but every one who  disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.”Œ¬It is most unfair.â€    â€œPerhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,â€ said Mr.  Erskine â€œI myself would say that it had merely been detected.â€    â€œOh!”Œ”It is not devoid of traces  of the influence of that leader of female thought in her day, Miss  Anna Seward, known to some as the Swan of Lichfield.”Œ¯It is related that on  one occasion he nearly frightened to death a watchman who was guarding  the coffin of a Tennessee Senator who was lying in state in the Senate  Chamber.”Œ\It may be a  disappointment to you to learn that Rendcomb Manor was new that I  cannot help.”X¶  It means  that you are worthy to look on the august and villainous dead,  and you will find yourself shown into some vaulted or tapestried  chamber, without benefit of electric light, and are told that  greatgreatgrandmamma Bridget occasionally has vague business by the  fireplace, but it is better not to talk to her, and that you will hear  Master Anthony â€œawfully wellâ€ if he attempts the front staircase any  time before morning.”Œ1It might be a  most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.”Œ’It relates to the rifling of a mausoleum in Middlesex which stood in a  park now broken up, the property of a noble family which I will not  name.”Œ«It stole up from belowan awful blackness that seemed to drink  in all the radiations of light in the building, leaving nothing but  the ghost of a radiance in their place.”ŒfIt was  such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,  and Shakespeare himself.”jI  ŒNIt was a New York man who gave expression to this rather  startling statement.”ŒwIt was a greatgreatgrandfather of Mr.  Eliphalet Hitchcock who was foremost in the time of the Salem witchcraft  craze.”X7  It was a notemerely a note, on scented and tinted paper, for  Ernestine was not above these feminine prettinesses, written in her  graceful style and ladylike handto say that he was never absent  from her thoughts, and how she and Herminia had wept and prayed in  secret on the night the army crossed the Rhine.”Œ˜It was a rather curious one of Moorish  workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished  steel, and studded with coarse turquoises.”ŒØIt was an American paper and  what it recorded was this    â€œThe body of Mr Silas R. Hume, who committed suicide last week at the  HÃ´tel Beau Site, Moulin sur Chalons, is to be buried at his house in  Boston, Mass.”Œ{It was barely four oâ€™clock, and the sun came down a long vista of blue  islands that led out to the open sea and Finland.”ŒaIt was but  too evident that Herminia had passed a disturbed night, a restless  and feverish day.”ŒèIt was impossible  for the small force in SaarbrÃ¼cka mere weak advanced guardto  withstand the many battalions sent against it by the Emperor,  especially as the attacking force was supported by an entire battery  of mitrailleuses.”•Z      X-  It was in the blaze of an evening in July, the air clear as crystal,  the sea a cobalt blue, when we left the steamer on the borders of  civilisation and sailed away with maps, compasses, and provisions for  the little group of dots in the SkÃ¤rgÃ¥rd that were to be our home for  the next two months.”ŒIIt was not a new world, but rather another  chaos, that it created in us.”X`  It was sent by a  gentleman, a justice of peace, at Maidstone, in Kent, and a very  intelligent person, to his friend in London, as it is here worded which  discourse is attested by a very sober and understanding gentlewoman, a  kinswoman of the said gentleman's, who lives in Canterbury, within a few  doors of the house in which the withinnamed Mrs. Bargrave lives who  believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit, as not to be put  upon by any fallacy and who positively assured him that the whole  matter, as it is related and laid down, is really true and what she  herself had in the same words, as near as may be, from Mrs. Bargrave's  own mouth, who, she knows, had no reason to invent and publish such a  story, or any design to forge and tell a lie, being a woman of much  honesty and virtue, and her whole life a course, as it were, of piety.”ŒjIt was strange how the sound of violins and trumpets accorded  with the drolleries of the wit from Prague.”Œ¾It was teatime,  and the mellow light of the huge, lacecovered lamp that stood on the  table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at  which the duchess was presiding.”ŒRIt was then about halfpast six, and we were just  seventyeight miles from Dunwich.”ŒTIt was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he  had intended.”ŒDIt was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl  Vane.”Xf  It was true, also, that during the  younger Mrs Linkworthâ€™s absence from home, mother and son had had a  violent quarrel arising originally from some trivial point in household  management, and that in consequence of this, she had actually drawn her  money out of the bank, intending to leave Sheffield next day and settle  in London where she had friends.”Œ‰It was, I believe, my mentioning some juggling tricks  which my brother in the East Indies had seen at the court of the Rajah  of Mysore.”Œ\It went straight towards Joanand  as it went the girl lifted her

in  the afternoon on a June day, in consequence of which Weston and I, not  requiring dinner, stopped at home after our return from the ride into  the desert, and talked to Mohamed, Abdulâ€™s son, and Hussein, Abdulâ€™s  youngest grandson, a boy of about twenty, who is also our valet, cook  and housemaid, and they together woefully narrated of the money that had  been and was not, and told us scandalous tales about Achmet concerning  his weakness for cemeteries.”ŒUSo Heinrich was at Frankenburg, and not with the old 95th before the  walls of Paris!”ŒLSo are  you.â€    â€œThere is no such thing as Black Magic,â€ said Weston.”ŒµSo at Frankenburg, as at many other places, where the hearts of the  people were with the flower of Germany, they could but wait and  praypray and be patient till true tidings came.”Œ½So he  told her all about it, and how whenever he went to Salem the two ghosts  interfered, and gave dark sÃ©ances and manifested and materialized and  made the place absolutely impossible.”Œ0So he made his plans  and he went down to Salem.”ŒñSo he scoot' past dat buryin'ground  whut on de hill, an' dat cemuntary whut betwixt an' between, an' dat  grabeyard in de

removed 'the intruder,' as she named him, for ever from the  path of Baron GrÃ¼nthal!”ŒÂSo the days of joy stole away at Frankenburg, till Charlie began to  reckon sadly the few that yet remained, when time would inexorably  separate him from Ernestine, and, too probably, for ever.”ŒðSo yiver'body 'low' dat so 'cep' Zack Badget, whut been tellin' de  ghosttale, an' he ain' gwine say "Yis" an'

fortunately for him, they were the soft and gentle ones of little  CÃ©landine de CaillÃ©.”X  Society at Frankenburg was narrow and monotonous most of the  visitors who came, especially Baron GrÃ¼nthal and the Justizrath,  spoke only of politics, of Bismarck's plans, and the coming war,  which did not interest the ladies, save in so far as the 95th  Thuringians were concerned.”Œ=Some day

dark hair floating over her laced pillow and delicate neck, as she  smiled tenderly on her mother, Herminia, and all who hovered about  her.”X•  Some food we had and some fresh water that      A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,      Out of his charity, who being then appointed      Master of this design, did give us, with      Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,      Which since have

evaporated creatures, and  the expriest in Paris had something terrible and condemned in his look.”ŒìSome private  case in the interior of Hungary claimed his attention, and it was not  till laterthe 15th of August, to be exactthat I had arranged to  meet him in Berlin and then return to London together for our harvest  of winter work.”X  Some time after, Mr. Veal's friends got him a place in the customhouse  at Dover, which occasioned Mrs. Veal, by little and little, to fall off  from her intimacy with Mrs. Bargrave, though there was never any such  thing as a quarrel but an indifferency came on by degrees, till at last  Mrs. Bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half though above a  twelvemonth of the time Mrs. Bargrave hath been absent from Dover, and  this last half year has been in Canterbury about two months of the time,  dwelling in a house of her own.”ŒÁSomething like fifty yards of broken ground, grey rock,  moss and lichen, lay between, and over all lay the curtain

ridiculous as if the statue of the commander in Don Juan had not  only accepted of the invitation of the libertine to supper, but had also  committed a beefsteak to his flinty jaws and stomach of adamant.”ŒVSuch an offer was deemed flattering, even for a daughter of the house  of Frankenburg.”ŒrSuch dreadful fellows 'those officers from the barracks' seem to be  all the world over, from

Manor.”ŒµThat evening, at eightthirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large  buttonhole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady  Narboroughâ€™s drawingroom by bowing servants.”X÷  That night, at the very time the three gentlemen were in the  smokingroom busy with their chinabowled pipes, and with silver  tankards of beer before themHeinrich full of happy dreams about his  fairhaired cousin and the trick they had played her the old Count  full of memories of Waterloo and the coming war, French insolence,  the Vaterland, and all the rest of it Charlie thinking how divinely  Ernestine sang and played, how sweet her downcast lashes looked, how  bright her upward glances, how lovely were the white hands that  wandered over the ivory keys, and made the said keys look very dark  and yellow by comparison, and while to him and Heinrich it seemed  that life at Frankenburg would be almost insupportable without the  two 'belles' thereof.”ŒÁThat same  evening I reached London.â€    â€œAnd how long altogether,â€ asked John Silence quietly, â€œdo you think  you stayed in the town of the adventure?â€    Vezin looked up sheepishly.”X&  Thatâ€™s the chief  thing.â€    â€œTell me more factsjust facts.â€    â€œIt began last summer when I came back from Ireland he had been here  alone for six weeks, and I thought him looking tired and queerragged  and scattered about the face, if you know what I mean, and his manner  worn out.”ŒµThe  whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away  to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you  should have shown more consideration.”ŒáThe Baron had made a careful study of his costume, and  was most gracious to the ladies, but more especially to the Countess,  who addressed nearly all her conversation to himthe winner of one  of 'the Belles of Frankenburg.'”Xæ  The Countess being always busy about the management of her household,  the Count having frequently to visit Aix about a lawsuit in one of  the courts there, and Heinrich being usually much with his fiancÃ©e,  threw Charlie and the young Grafine so much together that their  hearts were hopelessly entangled yet no word of love escaped the  latter he knew too well his lack of civil rank, and how many, or  rather how few, kreutzers he had per diem as a Prussian lieutenant  of infantry.”Xs  The Countess carefully folded her son's letter, and fixing her keen  grey eyes on Herminia, said, somewhat sententiously    'Though an old man now, the father of my Heinrich was as brave a  soldier as ever trod the soil of Germany, and his name is yet  venerated among the Uhlans of the Archduke and I am proud to say,  Herminia, that his son is worthy of such a father.'”ŒzThe Countess could detect in the face and deportment of her niece  that which the preoccupied or uninformed Count did not.”ŒëThe Countess's ideas of propriety would not permit  her to allow her girls to peruse any other light literature but  having an idea that a married woman might read works of a  higherflavoured nature, she sometimes read the works of MM.”Xƒ  The Countess, who, though a modern lady of fashion, requiring her  novels, cushions, Spitz lapdog in a basket, and the Kladderadatch  to get through the day, was nevertheless, on the other hand, as  thrifty a German housewife as any of the old school, had bustled  about overseeing the culinary preparations, while her husband, Count  Ulrich, who was passionately addicted to the pleasures of the chase,  spent only half that day in the woods, and was now, with a huge pipe  having a china bowl and tassel in his mouth, watching, like a  sentinel, from a terrace before the drawingroom windows, the road  that wound away towards AixlaChapelle.”Xé  The Duchess she was down on the purser's list as  Mrs. Martin, but her friends and familiars called her the Duchess of  Washington Square and Baby Van Rensselaer she was quite old enough to  vote, had her sex been entitled to that duty, but as the younger of two  sisters she was still the baby of the familythe Duchess and Baby Van  Rensselaer were discussing the pleasant English voice and the not  unpleasant English accent of a manly young lordling who was going to  America for sport.”X“  The French, aware of the vital importance of keeping possession of a  hill on their right, as soon as their troops began to fall back  before those battalions sent forward by General Steinmetz, threw up  some earthen works, in rear of which their 62nd regiment of the line  lay down, while several batteries of artillery fired over their  heads, raining grape and shell upon the fastadvancing Prussians.”ŒÉThe Grosvenor  is really the only place.â€    â€œI donâ€™t think I shall send it anywhere,â€ he

Bertrandus liberavit hominem quem            diabolus diu volebat strangulare."”ŒÇThe dawn stole in over the city, and the Rhine began to glitter in  lightthe dawn of that day on which the Baron GrÃ¼nthal was to return  to Frankenburg, and 'the final arrangements' were to be made.”X  The day had been  warm and muggy, but when I looked in on the way up to my room, it  seemed to me to have grown suddenly and bitterly cold, not with the  dampness of English frost, but with the clear and stinging exhilaration  of such days as we had recently spent in Switzerland.”XS  The digestion, however,  may become suddenly atrophied, delirium tremens may, without warning,  supervene, or he may go completely off his head....â€                                           But the weeks passed on, the July suns made London reel in a haze of  heat, and yet Alingham remained busy, brilliant and altogether  exceptional.”ŒEThe dim roar of London  was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.”X?  The enthusiasm all over Germany was unquestionably great at this  time, and as a specimen of it, Heinrich told Charlie, exultingly, how  his father's old comrade and brother officer, Field Marshal the Count  Von Wrangel, then in the eightyfourth year of his age, on seeing his  old regiment, the 3rd Cuirassiers, marching through Berlin, had  petitioned the king for leave to join them as a private, as he was  now too aged to lead but the king declined the offer of the brave  old man, and requested him to remain in Berlin, and make himself  useful in a more peaceable way.”j®  X  The explanation which Weston gives us  of all these phenomena, is that a certain picture of people I know is  present in my mind, though I may not be aware of it,present to my  subliminal self, I think, he says,and that I give an unspoken  suggestion to the hypnotised Machmout.”Œ‰The family of Elihu Osborn lives in this house,  and ghosts have been clambering through it lately in a wonderfully  promiscuous fashion.”e(ŒœThe fiery spook, it is said, still makes its  nightly trips to Diamond Island, but no more investigating parties have  ventured across to solve the mystery.”ŒdThe figure waved her arms towards the house, and  my mother heard the bitter wailing of the Banshee.”Œ.The firing  first began at the village of Ste.”ŒYThe firm in Bermondsey which was third on his  list was accustomed to handling this line.”XJ  The first conversation was, of course, about the  expected war concerning the Spanish succession, the political  sketches in the Kladderadatch, the official accounts in the Staats  Anzeiger how all Paris was brimming over with enthusiasm, rage, and  vengeance that crowds were always in the streets shouting, 'Down  with Prussia!'”ŒþThe former occupant who haunted you appears to have  been a woman of singularly atrocious life and character who finally  suffered death by hanging, after a series of crimes that appalled the  whole of England and only came to light by the merest chance.”ŒöThe furniture and hangings were all pale  blue silk, trimmed with white lace or silver watercolours decorated  the wall, and, in a place of honour, hung a Berlin engraving  representing the meeting of Wellington and Blucher at La Belle  Alliance.”Xf  The gardenwall was uncommonly high, the gate securely locked outlet  there was none and in another minute Frankenburg found himself in  the hands of a score of these French volunteers, so many of whose  comrades had beenno doubt, barbarouslyput to death by the  Prussians, simply for being found with arms in their hands, so that  to look for mercy was vain.”X  The general doctrine of hypnotism, suggestion, and  cure by such means had been accepted even in London by this time, and,  owing to a few papers I had written on the subject, together with my  foreign diplomas, I found that I was a busy man almost as soon as I had  arrived in town.”Œ¨The ghostly bride and bridegroom  went away at once on their bridal tour, and Lord and Lady Duncan went  down to the little old house at Salem to pass their honeymoon."”j»  ŒöThe hour was an unusual one for his  Excellency to be at Frankenburg, but he had been dining there the  evening before a storm had come on, and, to the infinite annoyance  of Ernestine, he had accepted the Count's invitation to remain all  night.”X(  The house itself, with  its two battlemented towers of Elizabethan times, gleamed with many  windows, and we passed out of sight of it, and into the shadow of a  boxhedge, clipped into shapes and monstrous fantasies, and found chairs  by the striped tent at the top of the sheltered bowlingalley.”ŒThe inquest held in Switzerland showed that he cut his  throat with a razor, in an attack of delirium tremens induced by drink.”ŒLThe joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine  also.”ŒkThe last boot held, the spoon went busily to the  monsterâ€™s mouth, and we just flowed into Kingâ€™s Lynn.”Œ¿The latter was certainly very eligible indeed with his  good looks, his title, and his million of money, and Lady  Madingleyexfuture Mrs Alinghamwas perfectly content with what she  had done.”X8  The letter was from Vantin, the notary, to the young doctor, who thus  found himself suddenly rich, so all obstacles were removed to a union  with CÃ©landine, when she was a few years older, though the family of  Adolphe was of humble origin and that of De CaillÃ© ancient, and shone  at the court of Louis XIII.”ŒåThe line of the invading  forces was thus so greatly extended that the French generalissimo  dared not make any offensive movement against them, but was compelled  to retreat along the highways that led from Gravelotte to Verdun.”Xg  The meal was taken somewhat silently, for at times      'When great events were on the gale,    And each hour brought a varying tale'    and when newspaper correspondents were often fallacious and fallible,  the gazettes were unfolded with fear and trembling, and the arrival  of a telegram was quite sufficient to terrify the quiet household at  Frankenburg.”ŒšThe medium is an elderly woman living in Brooklyn, who never appears in  public, and the only persons present were members of her family and  known to me.”Œ¬The month of January was near its end when Lord Kildonan, in the  Embassy at Lisbon, received a letter that for once gravely disturbed  that vain man and neglectful father.”ŒsThe moon  is red with dust, and because it is low.â€    â€œStill sensitive to external conditions,â€ said Weston.”Œ¶The most  famous Banshee of ancient times was that attached to the kingly house of  O'Brien, Aibhill, who haunted the rock of Craglea above Killaloe, near  the old palace of Kincora.”ŒéThe mother and daughter swept out of the room, their dressesthe  rustling moirÃ© of the Countess and the maizecoloured silk of  Ernestinegliding noiselessly over the varnished floor, and Herminia  was left to her own sad reflections.”jÊ  Œ€The next morning was pellucid summer a faint north wind blew, and a sun  worthy to illumine the isles of Greece flooded the sky.”X0  The night passed over quietly, and without alarm but with dawn of  day came an officer of Uhlans, attended by a trumpeter, flying at  full speed along the line of advanced posts, calling in all the  outpickets, while the King was probably already telegraphing to  Berlin as usual    'Another new victory!”Xö  The old butler, who had served as man and boy in the Frankenburg  family from shortly after the days of Waterloo and Ligny, who had  attended Marshal Blucher when on a visit, and had made the fortunes  and honour of the denizens of the Schloss his own, as hereditary  retainers of the Caleb Balderstone type occasionally do, even in this  age of iron, opened his grey eyes very wide, alike at the fierce  energy and the order of Charlie Pierrepont, but vanished at once to  rouse the grooms and comply.”ŒŠThe old lady's eyes were actually filled with tears, and after a  pause she said    'I regret, Herminia, that I ever sent you to England.'”X  The once smart officer of Uhlans, who had ridden on old Blucher's  staff at Waterloo, on that eventful day when the 'Iron Duke' wept  with joy to hear the boom of the Prussian cannonthe smart Lancer,  of whom the Countess had boasted at the Grand Hotel, was somewhat  obese now.”ŒrThe only silent one there was the radiant Herminia, who had been, as  her affianced said, 'so pleasantly tricked.'”Œ–The orphreys were  woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with  medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.”XC  The particular islands to which we had camping rights by virtue  of paying a nominal sum to a Stockholm merchant lay together in a  picturesque group far beyond the reach of the steamer, one being a mere  reef with a fringe of fairylike birches, and two others, cliffbound  monsters rising with wooded heads out of the sea.”ŒqThe point where we stooda huddled, shivering groupfaced the wider  channels that led to the open sea and Finland.”ŒxThe policeman on the  beat had heard it too, and it came from the hall of Louisâ€™ house, the  window of which was open.”ŒÍThe routed Hussars rallied  suddenly, wheeled about, and attacked their pursuers, and again  passed their fallen leader, and the old Grafa young Graf, thenin  their pursuit of the French, whom they routed.”ŒÓThe ruin, too, was haunted by the spectre of a former Count of  Frankenburg, who, resolving to get rid of his Countess, to the end  that he

heir to William Earl of Kildonan, is  one a stone altar tomb in Whitminster churchyard.”X/  The town was soon filled by Prussian  troops, but the hardy Thuringians pitched their tents near a village  on the bank of the river, on a pretty wooded slope and there on the  first evening of the halt, Charlie received some intelligence from  Frankenburg, which caused him much perplexity and thought.”ŒˆThe troops were considerably broken as they fought their way up the  hill, and some of the King's Grenadiers got mingled among the 95th.”ŒKThe uncanny, the unhealthyas in the master of such

called for next, and  the serious business of the meal began, amid all that noise and  hubbub peculiar to a German table d'hÃ´te, where Counts and Barons,  with ribbons and orders, may be seen handling their knives and forks  like English ploughmen, and pretty frauleins tugging away at chicken  bones with the whitest of teeth, and the most perfect air of  selfpossession.”Œ·Their father, Mr.

painful and ghastly the grasp of her hands became cold and  chilling, and her voice grew faint and husky, as she said,    'At Burtscheid, dearest Carl meet me at Burtscheid, where last we  met.'”X  Then he  looks up and says, â€œKhalÃ¡s,â€ which means, â€œIt is finished.â€    We only engaged Machmoutâ€™s services as second general domestic a  fortnight ago, but the first evening he was with us he came upstairs  when he had finished his work, and said, â€œI will show you White Magic  give me ink,â€ and proceeded to describe the front hall of our house in  London, saying that there were two horses at the door, and that a man  and woman soon came out, gave the horses each a piece of bread and  mounted.”Œ`Then it eddied, so to speak, and went across to Louis,  and his hair also moved, as I could see.”X…  Then one or two young Counts, friends of Heinrich, were among the  frequent visitors, and Charlie gnawed his moustache viciously, as he  pictured to himself, perhaps meeting her years hence, as the wife of  one of these, when he was getting grey, weary of waiting for the  promotion that never came or if it did, he would value so little  then for with her, the glory of life would depart.”ŒdThen the silent, uncreaking machinery of justice, characteristic of  England, began to move forward.”Œ Then there are  other storiesstories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of  dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in  London.”ŒÑThen, for the first time, the house ghost spoke, in a low,  clear, gentle voice, and with a quaint, oldfashioned New

supplied, sleep in their spikehelmets as soundly as in  a velvet nightcap, feel, by a bivouac fire, as comfortable as if in  the Grand Hotel at Cologne, and march to be maimed or massacred, to  wound and to slay, with genuine Teutonic taciturnity and phlegm.”ŒìThere he found young Frankenburg mounted on the horse of the  adjutant, who had fallen in the attack on Bellecroix, and whose duty  he had been ordered to take in the interim, an office that was nearly  costing him very dear soon after.”Œ´There is extant a tradition  to the effect that many years ago a party of Baltimore oystermen  encamped on the point, among whom was a man named Alley, who had  abandoned his wife.”ŒŠThere is no doubt that Calhoun County has a mystery which neither time,  bullets, courage nor philosophy can

loomed the shape of  the church next to the Gasthof der BrÃ¼dergemeinde and just beyond,  dimly rising into the sky, he saw with a sudden thrill the mass of  the huge school building, blocked

was none so he resolved to make the best of it, and turned to  the doorway just as the portly old Count of Frankenburg, the Baron  GrÃ¼nthal, limping as usual with gout, and Heinrich entered the church  together.”Œ£There was now a pause, after which the Countess said    'The Count urges our return before Heinrich arrives so we shall take  the train to AixlaChapelle tomorrow.'”X–  Thereafter the fantastic  entered, for on opening it I found inside the ace of diamonds, and  scribbled across it in his wellknown handwriting, â€œI am sending you  this for safe custody, as you know it is running an unreasonable risk to  keep aces in Italy.â€ The next evening I was just preparing to go  upstairs to dress when I heard the postmanâ€™s knock, and did precisely as  I had done in my dream.”X,  These I put  one evening into Machmoutâ€™s hand, when he was exhibiting to us his  curious powers of â€œthought transference.â€ The effect was that he  screamed aloud, crying out that the Black Magic had come, and though I  did not feel certain about that, I thought they would be safer in  midNile.”XW  These and many other details of atrocities, which  actually found their way into the London papers, he read for the  edification of the ladies, while Ernestine and Herminia exchanged  glances of horror and commiseration, as much as to say how awful it  was to think that those they loved so dearly had to run the risk of  perils such as these!”ŒöThese riflepits and other defences extended over a considerable  space of ground, from Colombey, with its fields of scarlet poppies,  to ArssurMoselle so famous for its red wines, including  Laguenxey, Grigy, and Borny, all pretty little hamlets.”ŒèThese she had already, and  the Baron of GrÃ¼nthal is lower in rank than a Grafine of the family  of Frankenburg,' he added so proudly, that there was much in his tone  and bearing which reminded Charlie of the Countess, his mother.”X¡  These two ideas filled her whole soul as she sat, silent and  motionless, looking out on the view that lay before the hotel  windows the broad waters of the famous Rhine, shining redly in the  light of the setting sun, covered with sailing vessels and steamers  shooting to and fro, its great pontoon bridge, through which the  current surged, the wilderness of roofs that formed the citythat  Rome of the north which Petrarch apostrophized

Heinrich and Herminia  together in the wood rather a common occurrence, by the way, when  these four went out on excursions, and had taken shelter from a  storm of rain in a village church, where a marriage ceremony had been  performed before them, and they now recurred to this little episode.”X»  They had visited the tomb of Charlemagne, where, as Ernestine, while  leaning on Charlie's arm, and looking up in his face, from under one  of the prettiest of hats, told him with bated breath, that when it  was opened in the tenth century, the Emperor was not found in the  usual fashion of the dead, reclining in his coffin, but seated on a  throne as if alive, clothed in imperial robes, a sceptre in his hand,  and the gospels on his knee.”ŒYThey live in the country near Benton, and were driving home  one night from a neighbor's.”Œ¯They must be contemporary, he decided, with the  unprincipled Canon Alberic, who had doubtless plundered the Chapter  library of St. Bertrand to form this priceless scrapbook.”X   They were passed by him in a chaos or confusion  of thought, in dreams of Ernestine, of the day in the Hoch Munster,  and the evening in the church at Burtscheid, of battlefields, with  lines of red kepis, fierce bearded faces, and hedges of bristling  bayonets looming through the smoke, of the roaring shriek of those  dreadful mitrailleusesthe veritable invention of Satan yea, even  the scowl and curse of the French captain were not forgotten but  after a time Charlie's thoughts became coherent he knew fully where  he was that a conical rifle bullet had been cut out of his back,  near the spine, by the skilful hands of Adolphe Guerrand that he had  a narrow escape from death that he was recovering, and had, as  nurses, CÃ©landine de CaillÃ© and her kind old bonne.”ŒÚThey were talking at slow intervals of some recent sorrow they had  sustained but so great was the slaughter of the French war, that  everyone in Germany then was wearing crape or

the man wished to go to  Australia, and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with the  events of the night.”X?  This is a truly horrific apparition, and no viewless specter  such as the invisible grimalkin that even now trips people up on the  stairs of the old mansion which President Madison and his wife, Dolly,  occupied, at the corner of Eighteenth Street and New York Avenue, after  the White House was burned by the British.”X³  This landscape has  never awakened into life itâ€™s still dreaming in its primitive sleep.â€    â€œIn time,â€ I put in, â€œyou mean a man

thick woods beyond it, from whence the white smoke spirted  out in incessant puffs as their wellconcealed skirmishers kept up a  galling fire on the enemy.”XF  Though the son of a foxhunting Warwickshire squire, who knew every  cover in Stoneleigh, the Brailes, and the Edgehills, the head of an  old but certainly embarrassed family, so far as mortgages and so  forth went, he was barely deemed among the wohlgeborn, according to  the Prussian standard and poor Charlie had nothing as yet but his  epaulettes and sword, his pay as a soldier of Fortune, with the  privileges usually accorded to Continental officers, such as going  everywhere at halfprice in virtue of their being in  uniformprivileges which ours would decline 'with thanks.'”X/  Though wearing the wellknown uniform of the Prussian army, it was  impossible not to recognize in the new arrival, as he sprang lightly  up the steps of the hotel, that he was an Englishman, a genuine  Briton, for he was the Carl

feeling his way over the loose shale, and  Kitty was laughing and chattering at my sidewhile all Simla, that is  to say as much of it as had then come from the Plains, was grouped round  the Readingroom and Peliti's verandaI was aware that some one,  apparently at a vast distance, was calling me by my Christian name.”ŒâWhile this was being done we strolled about the room, looking at  prints, with applause for a Bartolozzi that Louis had bought in the New  Cut, and dead silence over a â€˜Perditaâ€™ which he had acquired at  considerable cost.”X  Whom do you suspect it isI  mean,

looked dreamily down on Cologne, on city, church, and river, did  Charlie, from a balcony of his hotel, opposite the new theatre, look  down upon the strasse that leads to Borcette, and the crowded  boulevard that now occupies the place of a levelled ditch and  rampart, and is prettily laid out with pine trees, and many tiny  sheets of water.”Œ¿With my nerves still  unstrung from the previous night I feebly protested against the notion,  suggesting Observatory Hill, Jutogh, the Boileaugunge roadanything  rather than the Jakko round.”ŒjWith this comment upon the tale Mr. Pinckney boarded a passing caboose  and was soon on his way to Tacoma.”Œ©Within a few months after, it was found out  that his wife had consumption, and, without any loss of time, she was  sent off to Davos, with her sister to look after her.”XV  Worby proceeded to explain that during the  alterations, services were held in the nave, the members of the choir  being thereby disappointed of an anticipated holiday, and the organist  in particular incurring the suspicion of having wilfully damaged the  mechanism of the temporary organ that was hired at considerable  expense from London.”Œ[Would it  come to pass

presents he had sent Ernestine, from Berlin and  elsewhere, not one was ever to be seen on her slender wrists, her  fairylike hand, or round her delicate throat.”XÖ  Yet, oddly enough, though one would have thought that these benign and  cheerful influences of wholesome air and spaciousness of forest were  very healthful comrades for a man, in so far as nature can really  influence this wonderful human genus which has in these centuries  learned to defy her most violent storms in its wellestablished houses,  to bridle her torrents and make them light its streets, to tunnel her

she shrunk from the  dreadful esclandre of such a proceeding so settlements were made  and deeds signed, and from time to time she found beautiful ornaments  and jewels, the gifts of the Baron, on her toilette tables but she  never wore them, and the morocco cases remained unopened till at  last a serious illness, or sickness of the heart, in fact,  supervened, and the espousals were delayed, and the Count cursed the  hour that his thoughtless son had brought his troublesome English  comrade to Frankenburg.”ŒÃasked Heinrich, when Charlie had finished  the perusal of his letter 'I feel as anxious about these girls at  Frankenburg, as if I was Rip Van Winkle after his long snooze in the  Sleepy Hollow.'”ŒLasked Herminia, putting the whitest of feet into the  daintiest of

her hand, and  her usually pale cheeks and cold grey eyes inflamed with indignation.”j¦  ŒIexclaimed young Frankenburg, springing to his feet 'it  has come at last!”ŒOfaltered Herminia, now blushing

spite of our long day, I was glad when Hugh the rest of the men having  yawned themselves out of the smokingroom came back from the hospitable  dispensing of bedroom candlesticks with a briskness that denoted that,  as far as he was concerned, the distressing determination was not  imminent.”X:  â€œAnd yet,â€ continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with  that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of  him, and that he had even in his Eton days, â€œI believe that if one man  were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to  every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dreamI  believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we  would forget all the maladies of mediÃ¦valism, and return to the  Hellenic idealto something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it  may be.”Œâ€œAsmodelius, our Hauptbruder, is about us,â€ he cried in a voice that  even while it shook was yet a voice of iron â€œAsmodelius is about us.”Œ>â€œBasil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury  watch.”jÎ  Œoâ€œBrothers,â€ he announced, â€œit is my pleasure and privilege to introduce  to you Herr Harris

â€œEgypt!â€      II    Nothing happened to disturb me in the nightnothing, that is, except a  nightmare in which Colonel Wragge chased me amid thin streaks of fire,  and his sister always prevented my escape by suddenly rising up out of  the ground in her chairdead.”jÓ  Œƒâ€œHappierand safer,â€ she said gravely, the canoe giving a dangerous  lurch as she leaned forward in her seat to catch my

answered.”ŒRâ€œI have finished my Hungary business,â€ he wrote, â€œand  am here for ten days.”Œâ€œI left her in the forest of Arden I shall  find her in an orchard in Verona.â€    Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner.”Œfâ€œI promised to go to a club in Whitechapel  with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.”Œ™â€œI see a blackness like the blackness of Egypt before my face,â€ said  the tones of this unknown voice that seemed half his own and half  anotherâ€™s.”Œ´â€œI suppose you have heard the news, Basil?â€ said Lord Henry that  evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol  where dinner had been laid for three.”Œ•â€œI took last year for the first time a small forest up in Sutherland,  called Glen Callan, very remote and wild, but affording excellent  stalking.”Œ5â€œI want you  to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.”Œîâ€œIf Bruder Meyer has not put his Amati to bed, I will accompany him,â€  said the musician suggestively, looking across at a man whom Harris had  not yet noticed, and who, he now saw, was the very image of a former  master of that name.”ŒJâ€œIn London I found that I was a whole week out in my reckoning of  time.”Œ…â€œNone of the chaps  will speak to me now.â€    â€œI thought you had left England.â€    â€œDarlington is not going to do anything.”Œ°â€œOf course I go and  stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old  woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake  them up.”ŒÅâ€œOh, I go to bed about three usually,â€ he said â€œI suppose I sleep for  about four hours.â€    â€œAnd live on whisky, and eat like a Strasburg goose, and are prepared to  run a race tomorrow.”jè  X   â€œOur mystery has nothing to do with these dead symbols,â€ he said,  â€œbut with something perhaps even more ancient, and of another country  altogether.â€    â€œEgypt?â€ I said half under my breath, hopelessly puzzled, but recalling  his words in my bedroom.”Xu  â€œPrecisely what I expected,â€ the doctor said calmly â€œa fireelemental  sent upon its mission in the days of Thebes, centuries before Christ,  and tonight, for the first time all these thousands of years, released  from the spell that originally bound it.â€    We stared at him in amazement, Colonel Wragge opening his lips for  words that refused to shape themselves.”Œ–â€œTeesdale,â€ he said, â€œis it to tell me thisI donâ€™t want to be  rudebut this bogeytale that you have brought me here his evening?â€    â€œYes.”ŒUâ€œThat was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?â€    â€œYes it was at dear Lohengrin.”ŒOâ€œThe folk at Achnaleish are  the dourest and the most savage in all Scotland.”XŽ  â€œThe influence in this house, induced by my experiment, has killed in  a flash, in a sudden stroke, the sources of my humour, and, though I  still go on writing funny talesI have a certain name, you knowmy  inspiration has dried up, and much of what I write I have to burnyes,  doctor, to burn, before any one sees it.â€    â€œAs utterly alien to your own mind and personality?â€    â€œUtterly!”jï  X  â€œWait,â€ I whispered to Weston, â€œhe will use the Black Magic.â€    Again the wind dropped for a moment, and again, in the silence that came  with it, I heard the chiding of the hawk overhead, this time nearer, and  thought I heard more birds than one.”Œiâ€œWatch over Sibyl, Mother,â€ he cried, â€œwatch  over her.â€    â€œMy son, you distress me very much.”X  â€œWell, we went up to London as usual for the season, and though nothing  whatever occurred to remind me in any way of that single moment on  Christmas Eve, the reminding was seen to all right, the moment itself  took care of that, for instead of fading as is the way of sleeping or  waking dreams, it grew every day more vivid, and ate, so to speak, like  some corrosive acid into my mind, etching itself there.”Œ´â€œWhat do they say of us?â€    â€œThat Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.â€    â€œIs that yours, Harry?â€    â€œI give it to you.â€    â€œI could not use it.”Œâ€œYes I am Doctor  Teesdale.”ŒSâ€œYes, it is KhalÃ¡s.â€    â€œDid I tell you of the sitt in England?â€ he asked.”Œ:â€œYou must certainly send it next year to the  Grosvenor.”ŒQâ€œYou went to the opera while Sibyl  Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging?”XD  â€œYour brother, no doubt, was as much tormented as you have been,â€  he continued after a pause in which Colonel Wragge seemed deeply  preoccupied with his thoughts, â€œand tried to find peace by burying it  in the wood, and surrounding the wood then, like a large magic circle,  with the enchantments of the old formulÃ¦.”Œzâ€œâ€˜Achnaleish,â€™â€ she declaimed, â€œâ€˜is situated in one of the
